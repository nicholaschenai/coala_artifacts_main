        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z', but not at the very beginning or the very end of the string. The function should return `True` if such a 'z' exists, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character. During this iteration, we check if any of these characters is 'z'. If we find a 'z' in this range, we return `True`. If we finish the iteration without finding a 'z', we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function text_match_wordz_middle with parameter s\n       If the length of s is less than 3, return False\n       For each character in s from the second to the second-to-last character\n           If the character is 'z', return True\n       Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:\n    # If the string is too short to have a middle 'z', return False\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Iterate over the string from the second character to the second-to-last character\n    for i in range(1, len(s) - 1):\n        # Check if the current character is 'z'\n        if s[i] == 'z':\n            return True\n    \n    # If no 'z' was found in the middle, return False\n    return False\n```"

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Reflection]:\n    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task was to determine if the string \"abacaba\" can be placed exactly once in a given string by replacing question marks. This required checking possible placements and ensuring uniqueness.\n\n    2. **Initial Approach**: My approach involved iterating over possible starting positions for \"abacaba\", checking if it could be placed, and then verifying if it was the only occurrence. This was done by replacing '?' with 'z' after placing \"abacaba\".\n\n    3. **Official Solution Insights**:\n       - **Check Function**: The official solution uses a `check` function to count occurrences of \"abacaba\" in the string, which is a clean and reusable way to handle this check.\n       - **Early Exit**: The solution immediately exits if more than one occurrence is found initially, which is efficient.\n       - **Iterative Replacement**: The official solution iteratively tries to place \"abacaba\" and checks if the resulting string has exactly one occurrence, similar to my approach but with a more structured flow.\n       - **Use of Copy**: The official solution uses a copy of the string (`ok = s[::]`) to test modifications, ensuring the original string remains unchanged for further attempts.\n\n    4. **Efficiency and Clarity**: The official solution is efficient in handling edge cases and uses clear logic to ensure the string is modified correctly. It also uses Python's list slicing and copying effectively to manage string modifications.\n\n    5. **Learning Points**:\n       - **Function Reusability**: The use of a separate function to count occurrences is a good practice for clarity and reusability.\n       - **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution efficiently handles cases where \"abacaba\" is already present or cannot be placed uniquely.\n       - **Code Structure**: The structured approach of checking, modifying, and verifying in a loop is a robust way to handle such problems.\n\n    Overall, the official solution provided a structured and efficient way to solve the problem, reinforcing the importance of clear logic and efficient handling of string operations in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
