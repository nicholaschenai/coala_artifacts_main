INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/793 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a sorted list and a target element as inputs and returns the last index where the target element appears in the list. If the target element is not present in the list, the function should return -1.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Since the list is sorted, we can efficiently find the last occurrence of the target element by iterating through the list from the end to the beginning.
   - Start from the last element of the list and move backwards.
   - As soon as we find the target element, return its index.
   - If we reach the beginning of the list without finding the target, return -1.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function last(sorted_list, target):
       for index from length of sorted_list - 1 down to 0:
           if sorted_list[index] is equal to target:
               return index
       return -1
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def last(sorted_list, target):
    # Iterate over the list from the last element to the first
    for index in range(len(sorted_list) - 1, -1, -1):
        # Check if the current element is the target
        if sorted_list[index] == target:
            # Return the index if the target is found
            return index
    # Return -1 if the target is not found in the list
    return -1
```

This solution efficiently finds the last occurrence of the target element in a sorted list by iterating from the end to the beginning, ensuring that we return the last index where the target appears. If the target is not found, it returns -1.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, we were tasked with finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for paths in a tree from a root vertex to every other vertex. The core concepts involved include tree traversal, pathfinding in trees, and efficient LIS calculation using dynamic programming with binary search.

    ### Key Concepts and Strategies

    1. **Tree Representation**: The tree was represented using an adjacency list, which is efficient for traversal operations like DFS or BFS. This representation is crucial for efficiently finding paths in a tree structure.

    2. **Pathfinding in Trees**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path from the root to any vertex is unique. We used Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and maintain the path from the root to each vertex.

    3. **LIS Calculation**: The LIS was calculated using a dynamic programming approach with binary search, which is efficient with a time complexity of `O(L log L)`, where `L` is the length of the sequence. This method involves maintaining a list that stores the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences of different lengths.

    ### Challenges and Solutions

    - **Input Handling**: Initially, the code did not execute because the `main()` function was not called. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by explicitly calling `main()` at the end of the script.

    - **Output Format**: Ensuring the output was printed correctly, with each LIS length on a new line, was crucial for passing the tests.

    ### Code Snippet

    Here's the core function for calculating the LIS, which was central to solving the problem:

    ```python
    def calculate_lis(sequence):
        if not sequence:
            return 0
    
        lis = []
        for value in sequence:
            low, high = 0, len(lis)
            while low < high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if lis[mid] < value:
                    low = mid + 1
                else:
                    high = mid
            if low == len(lis):
                lis.append(value)
            else:
                lis[low] = value
    
        return len(lis)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of efficient data structures and algorithms for pathfinding and subsequence problems, especially in large datasets.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/793 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that finds the last position (index) of a given element in a sorted list. The function should return the index of the last occurrence of the element if it exists in the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list from the beginning to the end. As we iterate, we keep track of the index whenever we encounter the target element. By the end of the iteration, the index we have stored will be the last position of the element in the list. If the element is not found, we should return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function last(arr, target):
       last_index = -1
       for index from 0 to length of arr - 1:
           if arr[index] is equal to target:
               last_index = index
       return last_index
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def last(arr, target):
    # Initialize last_index to -1 to indicate the target is not found initially
    last_index = -1
    
    # Iterate over the array
    for index in range(len(arr)):
        # If the current element is equal to the target, update last_index
        if arr[index] == target:
            last_index = index
    
    # Return the last index where the target was found, or -1 if not found
    return last_index
```

This function iterates through the list, updating the `last_index` each time it finds the target. By the end of the loop, `last_index` will hold the index of the last occurrence of the target, or -1 if the target is not in the list.
