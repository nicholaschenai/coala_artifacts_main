    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that finds the last position (index) of a given element in a sorted list. The function should return the index of the last occurrence of the element if it exists in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list from the beginning to the end. As we iterate, we keep track of the index whenever we encounter the target element. By the end of the iteration, the index we have stored will be the last position of the element in the list. If the element is not found, we should return -1.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function last(arr, target):\n       last_index = -1\n       for index from 0 to length of arr - 1:\n           if arr[index] is equal to target:\n               last_index = index\n       return last_index\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef last(arr, target):\n    # Initialize last_index to -1 to indicate the target is not found initially\n    last_index = -1\n    \n    # Iterate over the array\n    for index in range(len(arr)):\n        # If the current element is equal to the target, update last_index\n        if arr[index] == target:\n            last_index = index\n    \n    # Return the last index where the target was found, or -1 if not found\n    return last_index\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the list, updating the `last_index` each time it finds the target. By the end of the loop, `last_index` will hold the index of the last occurrence of the target, or -1 if the target is not in the list.",
