## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given element is the majority element in a sorted array. The majority element is defined as an element that appears more than half the time in the array. The function should return `True` if the element is the majority element, and `False` otherwise.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Majority Element Condition**: For an element to be the majority, it must appear more than `n/2` times in the array, where `n` is the length of the array.

2. **Utilize the Sorted Property**: Since the array is sorted, if an element is the majority, it will appear consecutively in the array. This allows us to efficiently check for the majority element.

3. **Binary Search for First Occurrence**: Use binary search to find the first occurrence of the element in the array.

4. **Check the Count**: Once the first occurrence is found, check if the element appears more than `n/2` times by comparing the index of the first occurrence and the index `first_occurrence + n/2`.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a helper function `binary_search_first_occurrence` to find the first occurrence of the element using binary search.
2. In the main function `is_majority`, use the helper function to find the first occurrence of the element.
3. If the element is not found, return `False`.
4. Check if the element at the index `first_occurrence + n/2` is the same as the element.
5. Return `True` if it is the same, otherwise return `False`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def binary_search_first_occurrence(arr, n, element):
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    result = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == element:
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1  # Continue searching in the left half
        elif arr[mid] < element:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return result

def is_majority(arr, n, element):
    # Find the first occurrence of the element
    first_occurrence = binary_search_first_occurrence(arr, n, element)
    
    # If the element is not found, it cannot be the majority
    if first_occurrence == -1:
        return False
    
    # Check if the element appears more than n/2 times
    if first_occurrence + n // 2 < n and arr[first_occurrence + n // 2] == element:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This solution efficiently checks if the given element is the majority element by leveraging the sorted property of the array and using binary search to find the first occurrence of the element.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to count the number of inversions in an array for multiple test cases. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices \(i, j\) such that \(i < j\) and \(arr[i] > arr[j]\). The challenge was to implement an efficient solution that could handle large arrays, given the constraints.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns

    The problem tests the understanding of inversion counting using a modified merge sort algorithm. This approach leverages the divide-and-conquer strategy to count inversions in \(O(N \log N)\) time, which is efficient for large inputs. The key insight is that during the merge step, if an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, it indicates inversions equal to the number of remaining elements in the left subarray.

    ### Strategies and Fixes

    Initially, the solution logic was correct, but the script failed to produce output because the `main()` function was not called. This was a simple oversight that was fixed by adding a conditional check to call `main()` when the script is executed directly. This is a common practice in Python to ensure that the script's main logic is executed only when it is run as the main program.

    ### Code Snippet

    Here's the key part of the solution that counts inversions using merge sort:

    ```python
    def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
        # Merging and counting inversions
        # ...

    def merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
        # Recursive merge sort and inversion counting
        # ...

    def count_inversions(arr):
        # Initialize and call merge_sort_and_count
        # ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that the main function is executed in scripts that rely on standard input/output, especially in competitive programming and testing environments.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/223 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine if a given element is the majority element in a sorted array. A majority element is defined as an element that appears more than half the time in the array. We are given a sorted array, its length, and the element to check.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Since the array is sorted, if an element is the majority element, it must appear consecutively in the array. We can use binary search to find the first occurrence of the element. Once we have the first occurrence, we can check if the element appears more than `n/2` times by checking the element at the index `first_occurrence + n//2`. If this element is the same as the given element, then it is the majority element.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function is_majority(arr, n, x):
       Find the first occurrence of x using binary search:
           Initialize low to 0 and high to n-1
           While low is less than or equal to high:
               Calculate mid as (low + high) // 2
               If arr[mid] is equal to x and (mid is 0 or arr[mid-1] is not x):
                   Return mid
               Else if arr[mid] is less than x:

               Else:
                   Set high to mid - 1
           Return -1 (if x is not found)
       
       Get the first occurrence index of x
       If first occurrence is -1, return False
       If first occurrence + n//2 is less than n and arr[first occurrence + n//2] is x:
           Return True
       Else:
           Return False
   ```

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
