INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/798 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of those numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and keep a running total of the sum. We start with a sum of zero and add each number in the list to this sum. Finally, we return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function _sum that takes a list of numbers as input
       Initialize a variable total to 0
       For each number in the list
           Add the number to total
       Return total
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def _sum(arr):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total = 0
    # Iterate over each number in the array
    for num in arr:
        # Add the current number to the total sum
        total += num
    # Return the total sum
    return total
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was efficiently computing the sum of elements in a subarray for multiple queries. The key strategy was to use a prefix sum array, which allows each query to be processed in constant time. This approach is crucial when dealing with large input sizes, as it reduces the time complexity from O(N) per query to O(1).

    Initially, the solution was not producing any output because the function containing the logic was not called. This was a simple oversight but highlighted the importance of ensuring that all functions are executed as intended. Once the function call was added, the solution worked correctly.

    The experience reinforced the importance of:
    - Efficient input handling, especially for large datasets, using methods like `sys.stdin.read`.
    - Using prefix sums for range queries, a common technique in competitive programming.
    - Ensuring that all parts of the code, especially function calls, are correctly implemented to avoid logical errors.

    This problem was a good exercise in applying prefix sums and managing input/output efficiently, which are valuable skills in algorithmic problem-solving.
