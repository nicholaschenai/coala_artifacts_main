    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each element in the list and keep a running total of the sum. We will start with a sum of zero and add each element of the list to this sum. Finally, we will return the total sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function _sum that takes a list of numbers as input\n       Initialize a variable total_sum to 0\n       For each number in the list\n           Add the number to total_sum\n       Return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef _sum(numbers: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to zero\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Add the current number to the total sum\n        total_sum += number\n    # Return the computed sum\n    return total_sum\n```",
