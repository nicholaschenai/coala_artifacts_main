    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a cube when given the length of one of its sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The volume of a cube can be calculated using the formula \\( V = \\text{side}^3 \\), where \"side\" is the length of one of the cube's edges. To solve this problem, we will take the side length as input and return the cube of this value as the volume.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named volume_cube that takes one parameter, side_length.\n   Calculate the volume by raising side_length to the power of 3.\n   Return the calculated volume.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef volume_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the volume of the cube by cubing the side length\n    volume = side_length ** 3\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `side_length` as input, computes the cube of this value, and returns the result, which is the volume of the cube.",
