    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a list of tuples and returns a dictionary. Each unique tuple in the list should be a key in the dictionary, and the value should be the number of times that tuple appears in the list. Additionally, if a tuple appears in reverse order, it should be considered the same tuple. For example, (1, 3) and (3, 1) should be treated as the same tuple.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the tuples and their counts.\n2. Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n3. For each tuple, sort it to ensure that (a, b) and (b, a) are treated as the same.\n4. Convert the sorted tuple back to a tuple (since lists are not hashable and cannot be used as dictionary keys).\n5. Check if this sorted tuple is already a key in the dictionary:\n   - If it is, increment its count by 1.\n   - If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n6. After processing all tuples, return the dictionary.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction check_occurences(tuples_list):\n    initialize an empty dictionary called occurrences\n    for each tuple in tuples_list:\n        sort the tuple\n        convert the sorted list back to a tuple\n        if the sorted tuple is in occurrences:\n            increment the count for that tuple\n        else:\n            add the sorted tuple to occurrences with a count of 1\n    return occurrences\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_occurences(tuples_list):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the occurrences\n    occurrences = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        # Sort the tuple to handle reverse order equivalence\n        sorted_tup = tuple(sorted(tup))\n        \n        # Check if the sorted tuple is already a key in the dictionary\n        if sorted_tup in occurrences:\n            # Increment the count for this tuple\n            occurrences[sorted_tup] += 1\n        else:\n            # Add the sorted tuple to the dictionary with a count of 1\n            occurrences[sorted_tup] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary with tuple counts\n    return occurrences\n```\n\nThis solution ensures that tuples are counted correctly regardless of their order in the input list.",
