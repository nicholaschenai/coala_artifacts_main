The function should return a dictionary where each unique tuple (or its reverse) is a key, and the value is the number of times that tuple or its reverse appears in the list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each tuple.\n   - Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, create a sorted version of the tuple to handle both the tuple and its reverse as the same key.\n   - If the sorted tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count.\n   - If the sorted tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.\n   - After processing all tuples, return the dictionary.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function check_occurences(tuples_list):\n       initialize an empty dictionary called tuple_count\n       for each tuple in tuples_list:\n           sort the tuple to handle both tuple and its reverse\n           if sorted tuple is in tuple_count:\n               increment the count of the sorted tuple\n           else:\n               add the sorted tuple to tuple_count with a count of 1\n       return tuple_count\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_occurences(tuples_list):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each tuple\n    tuple_count = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        # Sort the tuple to handle both the tuple and its reverse as the same key\n        sorted_tup = tuple(sorted(tup))\n        \n        # If the sorted tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if sorted_tup in tuple_count:\n            tuple_count[sorted_tup] += 1\n        else:\n            # If the sorted tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n            tuple_count[sorted_tup] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing the counts of each tuple\n    return tuple_count\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list of tuples, normalizes each tuple by sorting it, and then counts the occurrences of each normalized tuple in a dictionary. The final dictionary is returned, which maps each unique tuple (or its reverse) to its count."

However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights:\n\n    1. **Data Structures**: The official solution uses a dictionary to map scores to the number of contestants, which is a neat way to handle the association between scores and contestants. This approach is similar to my use of `zip` to pair scores and contestants, but the dictionary provides direct access to the number of contestants for a given score.\n\n    2. **Sorting and Counting**: Both solutions involve sorting the scores and counting the number of decreases in the number of contestants. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to compare consecutive elements, which is a clean and efficient way to count decreases.\n\n    3. **Handling Ties**: The official solution uses a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score and then sorts these groups. This is an effective way to handle ties, ensuring that problems with the same difficulty are sorted by their indices.\n\n    4. **Output**: The official solution constructs a final list of problem indices by iterating over sorted difficulty scores and their associated problem indices. This approach is clear and ensures the correct order of output.\n\n    Overall, both solutions are similar in logic and efficiency. The official solution's use of dictionaries for grouping and sorting is a useful technique for handling ties and organizing data, which can be applied to similar problems in the future.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a list of tuples and returns a dictionary. Each unique tuple in the list should be a key in the dictionary, and the value should be the number of times that tuple appears in the list. Additionally, if a tuple appears in reverse order, it should be considered the same tuple. For example, (1, 3) and (3, 1) should be treated as the same tuple.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the tuples and their counts.\n2. Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n3. For each tuple, sort it to ensure that (a, b) and (b, a) are treated as the same.\n4. Convert the sorted tuple back to a tuple (since lists are not hashable and cannot be used as dictionary keys).\n5. Check if this sorted tuple is already a key in the dictionary:\n   - If it is, increment its count by 1.\n   - If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n6. After processing all tuples, return the dictionary.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction check_occurences(tuples_list):\n    initialize an empty dictionary called occurrences\n    for each tuple in tuples_list:\n        sort the tuple\n        convert the sorted list back to a tuple\n        if the sorted tuple is in occurrences:\n            increment the count for that tuple\n        else:\n            add the sorted tuple to occurrences with a count of 1\n    return occurrences\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_occurences(tuples_list):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the occurrences\n    occurrences = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        # Sort the tuple to handle reverse order equivalence\n        sorted_tup = tuple(sorted(tup))\n        \n        # Check if the sorted tuple is already a key in the dictionary\n        if sorted_tup in occurrences:\n            # Increment the count for this tuple\n            occurrences[sorted_tup] += 1\n        else:\n            # Add the sorted tuple to the dictionary with a count of 1\n            occurrences[sorted_tup] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary with tuple counts\n    return occurrences\n```\n\nThis solution ensures that tuples are counted correctly regardless of their order in the input list."
