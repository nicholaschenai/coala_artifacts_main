We will iterate through each element in the list. If an element is a list itself, we will recursively flatten it and add its elements to the result. If an element is not a list, we will directly add it to the result. This way, we can handle any level of nesting.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define a function flatten_list that takes a list as input.\n   Initialize an empty list called flat_list to store the result.\n   For each element in the input list:\n       If the element is a list:\n           Recursively call flatten_list on this element and extend flat_list with the result.\n       Else:\n           Append the element to flat_list.\n   Return flat_list.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef flatten_list(nested_list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the flattened elements\n    flat_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in nested_list:\n        # If the element is a list, recursively flatten it\n        if isinstance(element, list):\n            # Extend the flat_list with the flattened result of the element\n            flat_list.extend(flatten_list(element))\n        else:\n            # If the element is not a list, append it directly to flat_list\n            flat_list.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the fully flattened list\n    return flat_list\n```\n\nThis solution uses recursion to handle any level of nested lists, ensuring that all elements are added to a single flat list."

The depth is the number of runs, you have to do.\n        - In every run you have to switch the direction. First run from left, next run from right. Next left...\n        Every run has these rules:\n        - You start at the first number (from the direction).\n        - Take for every number x the remainder of the division by the number of still available elements (from \n          this position!) to have the number for the next decision.\n        - If the remainder-value is smaller than 3, take this number x (NOT the remainder-Value) direct\n          for the new array and continue with the next number.\n        - If the remainder-value (e.g. 3) is greater than 2, take the next remainder-value-number (e.g. 3)\n          elements/numbers (inclusive the number x, NOT the remainder-value) as a sub-array in the new array.\n          Continue with the next number/element AFTER this taken elements/numbers.\n        - Every sub-array in the array is independent and is only one element for the progress on the array. \n          For every sub-array you have to follow the same rules for unflatten it.\n          The direction is always the same as the actual run.\n        ```\n\n        Sounds complicated? Yeah, thats why, this is the harder version...\n        Maybe an example will help.\n\n        ```\n         Array: [4, 5, 1, 7, 1] Depth: 2 -> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n \n        Steps: \n        First run: (start from left side!)\n        1. The first number is 4. The number is smaller than the number of remaining elements, so it is the remainder-value (4 / 5 -> remainder 4).\n           So 4 numbers (4, 5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the new array.\n        2. The next number is 1. It is smaller than 3, so the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n        Now we have --> [[4, 5, 1, 7], 1]\n\n        Second run: (start from right side!)\n        1. The last number (first from other side) is 1. So the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n        2. The next element is the sub-array. So we use the rules for this.\n        2a.The last number is 7. There are 4 elements in the array. So for the next decision you have to\n           take the remainder from 7 / 4 -> 3. So 3 numbers (5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the \n           new array.\n        2b.Now there is the 4 and only one element last in this array. 4 / 1 -> remainder 0. It is smaller\n           than 3. So the 4 is added direct to the new array.\n        Now we have --> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n        ```\n\n        The given array will always contain numbers. There will only be numbers > 0.\n\n\n        Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\n        I have created other katas.

The transformation process involves multiple runs, alternating the direction of processing (left-to-right, then right-to-left, and so on).
