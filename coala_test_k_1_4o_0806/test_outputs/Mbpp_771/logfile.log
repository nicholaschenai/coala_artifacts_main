INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given string expression containing brackets is balanced. An expression is considered balanced if every opening bracket has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing bracket. The types of brackets to consider are parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. The stack will help us keep track of the opening brackets as we encounter them. When we encounter a closing bracket, we will check if it matches the most recent opening bracket stored in the stack. If it matches, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. If it doesn't match or if the stack is empty when we encounter a closing bracket, the expression is not balanced. At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is not.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Create a dictionary to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
3. Iterate over each character in the expression:
   - If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket:
     - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, return False (unbalanced).
     - Pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If it doesn't match, return False.
4. After iterating through the expression, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return True (balanced); otherwise, return False.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_expression(expression: str) -> bool:
    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    # Dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    # Iterate over each character in the expression
    for char in expression:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if char in bracket_map.values():
            stack.append(char)
        # If the character is a closing bracket
        elif char in bracket_map:
            # If the stack is empty, it means there's no matching opening bracket
            if not stack:
                return False
            # Pop the top element from the stack
            top_element = stack.pop()
            # Check if the popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket
            if bracket_map[char] != top_element:
                return False
    
    # If the stack is empty, all opening brackets have been matched
    return not stack
```

This solution uses a stack to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing bracket, thus determining if the expression is balanced.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem of evaluating a simple mathematical expression string was straightforward, and my initial approach closely aligned with the official solution. Both solutions utilized a stack to handle parentheses and maintain the correct order of operations, and both iterated through the string character by character to build numbers and apply operations.

    Key insights from the official solution:
    - The use of `ord(c) - ord('0')` to convert a character to its integer value is a neat trick that avoids using `int(c)`. This is a minor optimization but can be useful in environments where performance is critical.
    - The official solution resets the `sign` to `1` after processing a closing parenthesis, which is a good practice to ensure that the sign is correctly initialized for any subsequent operations.
    - The final check `if num:` before adding the last number to the result ensures that any remaining number is added to the result, which is a good safeguard against missing the last number in the expression.

    Overall, the problem was a good exercise in using stacks to manage nested operations and ensuring that all parts of the expression are evaluated correctly. The official solution confirmed the effectiveness of the stack-based approach and provided a few minor optimizations that could be useful in similar problems.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine if a given string of brackets is balanced. A string is considered balanced if every opening bracket has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing bracket. The types of brackets to consider are parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. As we iterate through each character in the string:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (`{`, `[`, or `(`), we push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (`}`, `]`, or `)`), we check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, we pop the stack. If not, the string is unbalanced.
   - After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the string is balanced; otherwise, it is not.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function check_expression(expression):
       create an empty stack
       create a mapping of closing to opening brackets
       
       for each character in expression:
           if character is an opening bracket:
               push it onto the stack
           else if character is a closing bracket:

                   return False
