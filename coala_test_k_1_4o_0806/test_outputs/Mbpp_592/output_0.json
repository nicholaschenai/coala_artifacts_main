    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the products of consecutive binomial coefficients for a given integer `n`. The binomial coefficient, often denoted as C(n, k), represents the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Calculate the binomial coefficients for a given `n`.\n   - Compute the product of each pair of consecutive binomial coefficients.\n   - Sum these products to get the final result.\n\n   The binomial coefficient C(n, k) can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k! \\times (n-k)!}\n   \\]\n   where `!` denotes factorial.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function sum_Of_product(n):\n       initialize sum to 0\n       for k from 0 to n-1:\n           calculate C(n, k) using factorial formula\n           calculate C(n, k+1) using factorial formula\n           calculate product of C(n, k) and C(n, k+1)\n           add product to sum\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef factorial(x):\n    # Helper function to calculate factorial of x\n    if x == 0 or x == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(2, x + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\ndef binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)\n    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))\n\ndef sum_Of_product(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of products\n    sum_of_products = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each pair of consecutive binomial coefficients\n    for k in range(n):\n        # Calculate C(n, k) and C(n, k+1)\n        c_n_k = binomial_coefficient(n, k)\n        c_n_k1 = binomial_coefficient(n, k + 1)\n        \n        # Calculate the product of consecutive binomial coefficients\n        product = c_n_k * c_n_k1\n        \n        # Add the product to the sum\n        sum_of_products += product\n    \n    # Return the total sum of products\n    return sum_of_products\n```\n\nThis code calculates the sum of the products of consecutive binomial coefficients for a given `n` by iterating through each pair of consecutive coefficients, computing their product, and summing these products.",
