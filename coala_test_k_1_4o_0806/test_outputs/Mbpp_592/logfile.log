INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/592 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients for a given integer `n`. The binomial coefficient, often denoted as C(n, k), represents the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand Binomial Coefficients**: The binomial coefficient C(n, k) is calculated as `n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`, where `!` denotes factorial.

2. **Consecutive Binomial Coefficients**: For a given `n`, the consecutive binomial coefficients are C(n, 0), C(n, 1), ..., C(n, n).

3. **Product of Consecutive Coefficients**: We need to find the product of each pair of consecutive coefficients: C(n, 0) * C(n, 1), C(n, 1) * C(n, 2), ..., C(n, n-1) * C(n, n).

4. **Sum of Products**: Sum up all these products to get the final result.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `factorial` to compute the factorial of a number.
2. Define a function `binomial_coefficient` to compute C(n, k) using the factorial function.
3. Define the main function `sum_Of_product(n)`:
   - Initialize a variable `sum_product` to 0.
   - Loop over `k` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - Calculate the product of C(n, k) and C(n, k+1).
     - Add this product to `sum_product`.
   - Return `sum_product`.

### Python Code

```python
def factorial(x: int) -> int:
    if x == 0 or x == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, x + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

def binomial_coefficient(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))

def sum_Of_product(n: int) -> int:
    sum_product = 0
    for k in range(n):
        product = binomial_coefficient(n, k) * binomial_coefficient(n, k + 1)
        sum_product += product
    return sum_product
```

### Explanation

- **factorial**: Computes the factorial of a number using a loop.
- **binomial_coefficient**: Uses the factorial function to compute the binomial coefficient C(n, k).
- **sum_Of_product**: Iterates over each pair of consecutive binomial coefficients, computes their product, and accumulates the sum of these products. The function returns the final sum.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

    1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves combinatorial counting, specifically determining how many subsets of a set have a particular element at a specific position when sorted. This requires understanding binomial coefficients and powers of two.

    2. **Precomputation for Efficiency**: My approach involved precomputing factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate binomial coefficients. This is crucial for handling large inputs efficiently, especially given the constraints.

    3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Both my solution and the official solution correctly handle the case where \(K > I\), which is impossible and should return 0.

    4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly apply modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, which is a common requirement in competitive programming to prevent overflow and ensure results fit within standard data types.

    5. **Official Solution's Simplicity**: The official solution uses Python's `math.factorial` for direct computation of binomial coefficients, which is straightforward but may not be as efficient for very large inputs due to repeated calculations. My approach of precomputing factorials and inverses is more efficient for large-scale queries.

    6. **Function Call**: A key oversight in my initial solution was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed.

    In summary, the problem reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations and careful handling of input/output in competitive programming. The official solution, while straightforward, could benefit from precomputation techniques for better performance on large inputs.
