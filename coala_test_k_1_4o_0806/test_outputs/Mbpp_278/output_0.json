    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find out how many elements are present in a tuple before we encounter another tuple within it. For example, given a tuple `(1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)`, we need to count the elements before the first tuple `(4, 6)` appears.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Iterate through each element in the given tuple.\n   - Check if the current element is a tuple.\n   - If it is a tuple, stop the iteration and return the count of elements encountered before this tuple.\n   - If no tuple is found, return the total number of elements in the tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function count_first_elements(input_tuple):\n       initialize a counter to 0\n       for each element in input_tuple:\n           if the element is a tuple:\n               return the counter\n           increment the counter\n       return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_first_elements(input_tuple):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of elements before a tuple\n    counter = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the input tuple\n    for element in input_tuple:\n        # Check if the current element is a tuple\n        if isinstance(element, tuple):\n            # If it is a tuple, return the current count\n            return counter\n        # Increment the counter for each non-tuple element\n        counter += 1\n    \n    # If no tuple is found, return the total count of elements\n    return counter\n```",
