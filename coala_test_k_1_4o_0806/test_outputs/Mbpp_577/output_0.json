    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the last digit of the factorial of a given number. For example, if the input number is 4, the factorial is 24, and the last digit is 4.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the last digit of a factorial:\n   - Calculate the factorial of the given number.\n   - Extract the last digit of the resulting factorial by taking the modulus of 10.\n\n   However, note that for any number greater than or equal to 5, the factorial will end with a zero because it will include both a 2 and a 5 as factors, which multiply to give 10. Therefore, the last digit of the factorial for numbers 5 and above is always 0.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n       if n >= 5:\n           return 0\n       else:\n           factorial = 1\n           for i from 1 to n:\n               factorial = factorial * i\n           return factorial % 10\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is 5 or greater, the factorial will end with a 0\n    if n >= 5:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Calculate the factorial of n\n        factorial = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            factorial *= i\n        # Return the last digit of the factorial\n        return factorial % 10\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by recognizing that for numbers 5 and above, the factorial will always end in zero, thus simplifying the computation. For numbers less than 5, it calculates the factorial and returns the last digit.",
