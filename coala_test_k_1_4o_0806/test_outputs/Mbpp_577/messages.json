The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The task is to find the last digit of this product.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Factorials**: The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all integers from 1 to `n`. For example, `4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24`.\n\n2. **Last Digit**: The last digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. For example, the last digit of 24 is 4 because `24 % 10 = 4`.\n\n3. **Observations**:\n   - For numbers `n >= 5`, the factorial will always end in 0 because the factorial will include both 2 and 5 as factors, which multiply to give 10.\n   - For numbers `n < 5`, we can directly compute the factorial and then find the last digit.\n\n4. **Plan**:\n   - If `n` is less than 5, compute the factorial and return the last digit.\n   - If `n` is 5 or greater, return 0 because the factorial will end in 0.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n    if n < 5:\n        factorial = 1\n        for i from 1 to n:\n            factorial = factorial * i\n        return factorial % 10\n    else:\n        return 0\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is less than 5, calculate the factorial and return the last digit\n    if n < 5:\n        factorial = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            factorial *= i\n        return factorial % 10\n    else:\n        # If n is 5 or greater, the factorial will end in 0\n        return 0\n```"

Now, you should perform the following process:\n        - Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \\ldots, D_l)$.\n        - If $l = 1$, the process ends.\n        - Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \\ldots, D_{2 \\lfloor l/2 \\rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.\n        - Change $D$ to $E$.\n        When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n        - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the last remaining number.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n        - $1 \\le N \\le 10^{18}$\n\n        -----Subtasks-----\n        Subtask #1 (20 points):\n        - $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n        - $1 \\le N \\le 10^7$\n        Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n        -----Example Input-----\n        1\n        9\n\n        -----Example Output-----\n        3\n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \\rightarrow (2, 3) \\rightarrow (3)$.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        ### Analysis of the Problem\n\n        The issue seems to be related to the way the code is structured, particularly with the input and output handling. The function `solve()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads input and produces output is never executed. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that rely on standard input and output.\n\n        ### Step-by-Step Correction\n\n        1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.\n\n        2. **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the results are stored in a list. Each result is then printed in sequence.\n\n        3. **Output Handling**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.\n\n        ### Corrected Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):\n            # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers\n            last_digits = [0, 1]\n            for i in range(2, 60):\n                last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)\n    \n            # Find the position in the cycle\n            position = n % 60\n    \n            # Simulate the reduction process\n            sequence = last_digits[:position]\n            while len(sequence) > 1:\n                sequence = sequence[1::2]  # Keep only even-indexed elements (1-based)\n    \n            return sequence[0]\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            results = []\n    \n            for i in range(1, T + 1):\n                N = int(data[i])\n                result = last_digit_of_fibonacci(N)\n                results.append(result)\n    \n            for res in results:\n                print(res)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the solution\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Corrections\n\n        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.\n        - **Input and Output**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, and the results are stored in a list. Each result is printed in sequence after processing all test cases.\n\n        This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now executed properly.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):\n            # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers\n            last_digits = [0, 1]\n            for i in range(2, 60):\n                last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)\n    \n            # Find the position in the cycle\n            position = n % 60\n    \n            # Simulate the reduction process\n            sequence = last_digits[:position]\n            while len(sequence) > 1:\n                sequence = sequence[1::2]  # Keep only even-indexed elements (1-based)\n    \n            return sequence[0]\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            results = []\n    \n            for i in range(1, T + 1):\n                N = int(data[i])\n                result = last_digit_of_fibonacci(N)\n                results.append(result)\n    \n            for res in results:\n                print(res)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the solution\n        solve()\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '9'] Output: 3\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

For example, if the input number is 4, the factorial is 24, and the last digit is 4.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the last digit of a factorial:\n   - Calculate the factorial of the given number.\n   - Extract the last digit of the resulting factorial by taking the modulus of 10.\n\n   However, note that for any number greater than or equal to 5, the factorial will end with a zero because it will include both a 2 and a 5 as factors, which multiply to give 10. Therefore, the last digit of the factorial for numbers 5 and above is always 0.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n       if n >= 5:\n           return 0\n       else:\n           factorial = 1\n           for i from 1 to n:\n               factorial = factorial * i\n           return factorial % 10\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is 5 or greater, the factorial will end with a 0\n    if n >= 5:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Calculate the factorial of n\n        factorial = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            factorial *= i\n        # Return the last digit of the factorial\n        return factorial % 10\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by recognizing that for numbers 5 and above, the factorial will always end in zero, thus simplifying the computation. For numbers less than 5, it calculates the factorial and returns the last digit."
