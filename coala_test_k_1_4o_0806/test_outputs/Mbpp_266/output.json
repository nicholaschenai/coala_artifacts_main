    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube when given the length of one of its sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The lateral surface area of a cube is the total area of all the sides except the top and bottom. A cube has 6 equal square faces, and the lateral surface area is the sum of the areas of the 4 vertical faces. Each face has an area equal to the square of the side length. Therefore, the lateral surface area can be calculated by multiplying the area of one face by 4.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function lateralsurface_cube(side_length):\n       Calculate the area of one face: face_area = side_length * side_length\n       Calculate the lateral surface area: lateral_surface_area = 4 * face_area\n       Return lateral_surface_area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef lateralsurface_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of one face of the cube\n    face_area = side_length * side_length\n    # Calculate the lateral surface area by multiplying the face area by 4\n    lateral_surface_area = 4 * face_area\n    # Return the calculated lateral surface area\n    return lateral_surface_area\n```\n\nThis function takes the side length of a cube as input, calculates the area of one face, and then multiplies it by 4 to get the lateral surface area, which it returns.",
