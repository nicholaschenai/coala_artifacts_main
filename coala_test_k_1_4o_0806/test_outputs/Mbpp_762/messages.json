For each test case, we are given the colors of the six sides in a specific order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. Our task is to determine if there are three sides that are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color.\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Adjacency**: On a cube, the sides that are pairwise adjacent form a corner. There are four such corners:\n           - Front, Left, Top\n           - Front, Right, Top\n           - Back, Left, Bottom\n           - Back, Right, Bottom\n\n        2. **Checking for Same Color**: For each test case, we need to check if any of these four sets of sides are painted in the same color.\n\n        3. **Output**: For each test case, output \"YES\" if there is a set of three adjacent sides with the same color, otherwise output \"NO\".\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function check_adjacent_colors(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                colors = test_case\n                if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4]) or\n                   (colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4]) or\n                   (colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5]) or\n                   (colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):\n                    print \"YES\"\n                else:\n                    print \"NO\"\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def check_adjacent_colors(T, test_cases):\n            for colors in test_cases:\n                # Check the four possible sets of adjacent sides\n                if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4]) or \\\n                   (colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4]) or \\\n                   (colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5]) or \\\n                   (colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            test_cases.append(data[index:index + 6])\n            index += 6\n\n        check_adjacent_colors(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - We define a function `check_adjacent_colors` that takes the number of test cases `T` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.\n        - For each test case, we check the four possible sets of adjacent sides to see if they are painted in the same color.\n        - If any set of adjacent sides is the same color, we print \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n        - The input is read from standard input, and the function processes each test case accordingly.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['2', 'blue yellow green orange black green', 'green yellow green orange black green'] Expected output: [{'NO'}, {'YES'}] # Execution output: ['NO', 'NO']\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Failure\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
