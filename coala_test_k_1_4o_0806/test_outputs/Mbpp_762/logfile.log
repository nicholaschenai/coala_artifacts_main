INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/762 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

The task is to determine if a given month, represented by a number from 1 to 12, has 30 days. The function should return `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Months with 30 Days**: The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).
2. **Check the Month**: Given a month number, check if it is one of the months identified in step 1.
3. **Return the Result**: If the month number is one of those with 30 days, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

```
function check_monthnumber_number(month_number):
    if month_number is in [4, 6, 9, 11]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def check_monthnumber_number(month_number: int) -> bool:
    # List of month numbers that have 30 days
    months_with_30_days = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    
    # Check if the given month number is in the list
    if month_number in months_with_30_days:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This solution checks if the given month number is one of the months that have 30 days and returns the appropriate boolean value.

        Now he asks you to check if he can choose three sides such that they are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - A single line of each test case contains six words denoting the colors of painted sides in the order: front, back, left, right, top and bottom, respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, output a single line containing the word "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) corresponding to the answer of the problem.

        -----Constraints-----

        ## Problem Restatement

        We have a cube with six sides, each painted in one of six possible colors: black, blue, red, green, yellow, or orange. For each test case, we are given the colors of the six sides in a specific order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. Our task is to determine if there are three sides that are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Adjacency**: On a cube, the sides that are pairwise adjacent form a corner. There are four such corners:
           - Front, Left, Top
           - Front, Right, Top
           - Back, Left, Bottom
           - Back, Right, Bottom

        2. **Checking for Same Color**: For each test case, we need to check if any of these four sets of sides are painted in the same color.

        3. **Output**: For each test case, output "YES" if there is a set of three adjacent sides with the same color, otherwise output "NO".

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function check_adjacent_colors(T, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                colors = test_case
                if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4]) or
                   (colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4]) or
                   (colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5]) or
                   (colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):
                    print "YES"
                else:
                    print "NO"
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def check_adjacent_colors(T, test_cases):
            for colors in test_cases:
                # Check the four possible sets of adjacent sides
                if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4]) or \
                   (colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4]) or \
                   (colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5]) or \
                   (colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):
                    print("YES")
                else:
                    print("NO")

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            test_cases.append(data[index:index + 6])
            index += 6

        check_adjacent_colors(T, test_cases)
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - We define a function `check_adjacent_colors` that takes the number of test cases `T` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.
        - For each test case, we check the four possible sets of adjacent sides to see if they are painted in the same color.
        - If any set of adjacent sides is the same color, we print "YES". Otherwise, we print "NO".
        - The input is read from standard input, and the function processes each test case accordingly.
