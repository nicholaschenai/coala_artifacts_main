INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/586 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list and an integer `n` as inputs. The function should split the list at the `n`-th index and then move the first part of the list to the end. The result should be a new list where the elements from index `n` to the end of the original list come first, followed by the elements from the start of the list up to index `n-1`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, identify the position `n` in the list where the split should occur.
   - Divide the list into two parts: the first part from the start of the list to the `n-1` index, and the second part from the `n` index to the end of the list.
   - Concatenate the second part of the list with the first part.
   - Return the concatenated list as the result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function split_Arr(arr, n):
       first_part = arr[0:n]
       second_part = arr[n:]
       result = second_part + first_part
       return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def split_Arr(arr, n):
    # Split the list into two parts: from start to n-1 and from n to end
    first_part = arr[0:n]
    second_part = arr[n:]
    
    # Concatenate the second part with the first part
    result = second_part + first_part
    
    # Return the rearranged list
    return result
```

This function will take a list and an integer `n`, split the list at the `n`-th index, and rearrange it by moving the first part to the end, returning the modified list.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to compute the sums of all non-empty continuous subarrays of a given array, sort these sums, and then calculate the sum of a specified range of these sorted sums. The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.
    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.
    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.
    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
            subarray_sums = []
            for start in range(n):
                current_sum = 0
                for end in range(start, n):
                    current_sum += nums[end]
                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
            subarray_sums.sort()
            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])
            return result % (10**9 + 7)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.

   We need to write a function that takes a list and an integer `n`, splits the list at the `n`-th index, and then appends the first part of the list to the end of the second part. The function should return the modified list.

   - Identify the position in the list where the split should occur, which is given by the integer `n`.
