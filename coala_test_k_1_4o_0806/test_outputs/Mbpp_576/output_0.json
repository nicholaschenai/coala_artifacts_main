    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine if one list is a sublist of another list. A sublist is a sequence that appears in the same order within another list, but not necessarily consecutively.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To check if one list is a sublist of another, we can iterate through the larger list and try to find a starting point where the smaller list matches a sequence in the larger list. We will check each possible starting position in the larger list to see if the smaller list can be found starting from that position.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function is_Sub_Array with two parameters: main_list and sub_list\n       If the length of sub_list is greater than the length of main_list, return False\n       For each index i from 0 to (length of main_list - length of sub_list)\n           Assume sublist_found is True\n           For each index j from 0 to length of sub_list\n               If main_list[i + j] is not equal to sub_list[j]\n                   Set sublist_found to False\n                   Break the inner loop\n           If sublist_found is True\n               Return True\n       Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_Sub_Array(main_list, sub_list):\n    # If the sub_list is longer than the main_list, it cannot be a sublist\n    if len(sub_list) > len(main_list):\n        return False\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible starting index in the main_list\n    for i in range(len(main_list) - len(sub_list) + 1):\n        # Assume the sublist is found\n        sublist_found = True\n        # Check if the sub_list matches the sequence in main_list starting at index i\n        for j in range(len(sub_list)):\n            if main_list[i + j] != sub_list[j]:\n                # If any element doesn't match, set sublist_found to False and break\n                sublist_found = False\n                break\n        # If sublist_found is still True, we found the sublist\n        if sublist_found:\n            return True\n    \n    # If no matching sublist was found, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis code checks if `sub_list` is a sublist of `main_list` by iterating through possible starting positions in `main_list` and checking if `sub_list` matches the sequence starting from each position. If a match is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.",
