INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/7 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of words from that string which are at least 4 characters long.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Split the input string into individual words.
   - Iterate over each word and check its length.
   - If a word is 4 or more characters long, add it to a list.
   - Return the list of words that meet the length requirement.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function find_char_long that takes a string as input
       Split the string into words using spaces as delimiters
       Initialize an empty list to store words that are at least 4 characters long
       For each word in the list of words
           If the length of the word is 4 or more
               Add the word to the list of long words
       Return the list of long words
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_char_long(s: str) -> list:
    # Split the input string into words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store words that are at least 4 characters long
    long_words = []
    
    # Iterate over each word in the list of words
    for word in words:
        # Check if the word is at least 4 characters long
        if len(word) >= 4:
            # Add the word to the list of long words
            long_words.append(word)
    
    # Return the list of long words
    return long_words

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We need to find the smallest substring in a given string `S` that contains all the characters of another string `T`. If no such substring exists, we return an empty string. The solution should be efficient, ideally with a time complexity of O(n).

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain two pointers to represent the current window in `S` and use a dictionary to count the characters in `T` that we need to include in the window. As we expand the window by moving the right pointer, we will check if the current window contains all characters of `T`. Once it does, we will try to shrink the window from the left to find the minimum window that still contains all characters of `T`. We will keep track of the minimum window found during this process.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Initialize a dictionary to count characters in T
           Initialize a dictionary to count characters in the current window
           Initialize two pointers, left and right, to 0
           Initialize variables to track the minimum window size and its start position
           Initialize a variable to count how many characters from T are currently satisfied in the window

           While the right pointer is less than the length of S:
               Add the character at the right pointer to the window count
               If this character is needed and the count in the window matches the count in T, increment the satisfied count

               While the satisfied count equals the number of unique characters in T:
                   Update the minimum window size and start position if the current window is smaller
                   Remove the character at the left pointer from the window count
                   If this character is needed and the count in the window is less than the count in T, decrement the satisfied count
                   Move the left pointer to the right

               Move the right pointer to the right

           If a minimum window was found, return the substring from the start position with the minimum size
           Otherwise, return an empty string
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:

                dict_t = {}
                for char in t:
                    dict_t[char] = dict_t.get(char, 0) + 1
        
                # Number of unique characters in T that need to be present in the window
                required = len(dict_t)

                    if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] == dict_t[character]:
                        formed += 1
            
                    # Try to contract the window until it ceases to be 'desirable'
                    while l <= r and formed == required:
                        character = s[l]
                
                        # Save the smallest window until now
                        if r - l + 1 < ans[0]:
                            ans = (r - l + 1, l, r)
                
                        # The character at the position pointed by the `left` pointer is no longer a part of the window
                        window_counts[character] -= 1
                        if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] < dict_t[character]:
                            formed -= 1
                
                        # Move the left pointer ahead
                        l += 1
            
                    # Keep expanding the window
                    r += 1
        
                # Return the smallest window or an empty string if no window was found
                return "" if ans[0] == float("inf") else s[ans[1]:ans[2] + 1]
        ```

        This solution uses a sliding window approach with two pointers and a dictionary to efficiently find the minimum window containing all characters of `T` in `S`.
