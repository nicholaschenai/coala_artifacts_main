### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and combines them into a single integer. For example, given the list `[11, 33, 50]`, the function should return the integer `113350`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Convert Each Integer to a String**: Since integers cannot be concatenated directly, we will first convert each integer in the list to a string.
2. **Concatenate the Strings**: Join all the string representations of the integers together to form a single string.
3. **Convert the Resulting String Back to an Integer**: Finally, convert the concatenated string back to an integer to get the desired result.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `multiple_to_single` that takes a list of integers as input.
2. Convert each integer in the list to a string.
3. Concatenate all the string representations.
4. Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.
5. Return the resulting integer.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def multiple_to_single(numbers: list) -> int:
    # Step 1: Convert each integer in the list to a string
    string_numbers = [str(number) for number in numbers]
    
    # Step 2: Concatenate all the string representations
    concatenated_string = ''.join(string_numbers)
    
    # Step 3: Convert the concatenated string back to an integer
    result = int(concatenated_string)
    
    # Step 4: Return the resulting integer
    return result
```

This function will take a list of integers, convert each to a string, concatenate them, and then convert the result back to an integer, effectively joining the list of integers into a single integer.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We need to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer "N", and we need to output the sum for each test case.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify Multiples of 10**:
           - Multiples of 10 are numbers like 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N.

        2. **Calculate the Largest Multiple of 10**:
           - The largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N is `N // 10 * 10`.

        3. **Sum of Multiples of 10**:
           - The multiples of 10 up to this largest multiple form an arithmetic series: 10, 20, 30, ..., M.
           - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: `Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2`.
           - The number of terms is `M / 10`.

        4. **Implementation**:
           - For each test case, calculate the largest multiple of 10, then compute the sum using the arithmetic series formula.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
            M = (N // 10) * 10
            number_of_terms = M // 10
            sum = number_of_terms * (10 + M) // 2
            return sum

        function main():
            read T
            for each test case:
                read N
                result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
                print result
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
            # Calculate the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N
            M = (N // 10) * 10
            # Calculate the number of terms in the series
            number_of_terms = M // 10
            # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series
            sum = number_of_terms * (10 + M) // 2
            return sum

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the main function to execute the program
        main()
        ```

        This solution efficiently calculates the sum of multiples of 10 for each test case using the arithmetic series formula, ensuring it handles up to 10 test cases and values of N up to 1,000,000,000 efficiently.
