For example, given the list `[11, 33, 50]`, the function should return the integer `113350`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Convert Each Integer to a String**: Since integers cannot be concatenated directly, we will first convert each integer in the list to a string.\n2. **Concatenate the Strings**: Join all the string representations of the integers together to form a single string.\n3. **Convert the Resulting String Back to an Integer**: Finally, convert the concatenated string back to an integer to get the desired result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `multiple_to_single` that takes a list of integers as input.\n2. Convert each integer in the list to a string.\n3. Concatenate all the string representations.\n4. Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.\n5. Return the resulting integer.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef multiple_to_single(numbers: list) -> int:\n    # Step 1: Convert each integer in the list to a string\n    string_numbers = [str(number) for number in numbers]\n    \n    # Step 2: Concatenate all the string representations\n    concatenated_string = ''.join(string_numbers)\n    \n    # Step 3: Convert the concatenated string back to an integer\n    result = int(concatenated_string)\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the resulting integer\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take a list of integers, convert each to a string, concatenate them, and then convert the result back to an integer, effectively joining the list of integers into a single integer."

Each test case provides a single integer \"N\", and we need to output the sum for each test case.\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Identify Multiples of 10**:\n           - Multiples of 10 are numbers like 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N.\n\n        2. **Calculate the Largest Multiple of 10**:\n           - The largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N is `N // 10 * 10`.\n\n        3. **Sum of Multiples of 10**:\n           - The multiples of 10 up to this largest multiple form an arithmetic series: 10, 20, 30, ..., M.\n           - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: `Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2`.\n           - The number of terms is `M / 10`.\n\n        4. **Implementation**:\n           - For each test case, calculate the largest multiple of 10, then compute the sum using the arithmetic series formula.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n            M = (N // 10) * 10\n            number_of_terms = M // 10\n            sum = number_of_terms * (10 + M) // 2\n            return sum\n\n        function main():\n            read T\n            for each test case:\n                read N\n                result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n                print result\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n            # Calculate the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N\n            M = (N // 10) * 10\n            # Calculate the number of terms in the series\n            number_of_terms = M // 10\n            # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series\n            sum = number_of_terms * (10 + M) // 2\n            return sum\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            results = []\n    \n            for i in range(1, T + 1):\n                N = int(data[i])\n                result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n                results.append(result)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the main function to execute the program\n        main()\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently calculates the sum of multiples of 10 for each test case using the arithmetic series formula, ensuring it handles up to 10 test cases and values of N up to 1,000,000,000 efficiently.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '10'] Output: 10\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
