    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given two lists of the same length. We need to count how many indices have the same value in both lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through both lists simultaneously. For each index, we will compare the values from both lists. If the values are the same, we will increase our count by one. Finally, we will return the count of indices where the values are the same.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter to 0\n   For each index in the range of the length of the lists:\n       If the value at the current index in the first list is equal to the value at the same index in the second list:\n           Increment the counter by 1\n   Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of indices with the same values\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Compare the values at the current index in both lists\n        if list1[i] == list2[i]:\n            # If they are the same, increment the counter\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of indices with the same values\n    return count\n```",
