Our task is to count how many indices have the same value in both lists.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can iterate through both lists simultaneously and compare the elements at each index. We will maintain a counter to keep track of how many times the elements at the same index in both lists are equal. Finally, we will return this counter as the result.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\n1. Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Loop through the indices of the lists:\n   a. If the element at the current index in the first list is equal to the element at the same index in the second list, increment the counter.\n3. After the loop ends, return the counter.\n```\n\n### 4.

However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights:\n\n    1. **Data Structures**: The official solution uses a dictionary to map scores to the number of contestants, which is a neat way to handle the association between scores and contestants. This approach is similar to my use of `zip` to pair scores and contestants, but the dictionary provides direct access to the number of contestants for a given score.\n\n    2. **Sorting and Counting**: Both solutions involve sorting the scores and counting the number of decreases in the number of contestants. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to compare consecutive elements, which is a clean and efficient way to count decreases.\n\n    3. **Handling Ties**: The official solution uses a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score and then sorts these groups. This is an effective way to handle ties, ensuring that problems with the same difficulty are sorted by their indices.\n\n    4. **Output**: The official solution constructs a final list of problem indices by iterating over sorted difficulty scores and their associated problem indices. This approach is clear and ensures the correct order of output.\n\n    Overall, both solutions are similar in logic and efficiency. The official solution's use of dictionaries for grouping and sorting is a useful technique for handling ties and organizing data, which can be applied to similar problems in the future.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
