    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of items, each with a name and a price, and an integer `n`. The function should return a list of the `n` most expensive items from the input list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Sort the list of items in descending order based on their price.\n   - Select the first `n` items from this sorted list, as they will be the most expensive.\n   - Return this list of `n` most expensive items.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function expensive_items(items, n):\n       sort items in descending order by price\n       return the first n items from the sorted list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef expensive_items(items, n):\n    # Sort the items in descending order based on their price\n    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)\n    \n    # Return the first n items from the sorted list\n    return sorted_items[:n]\n```\n\nThis function sorts the list of items by their price in descending order and then slices the list to return the top `n` most expensive items.",
