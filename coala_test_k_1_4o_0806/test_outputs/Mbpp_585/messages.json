The function should also take an integer `n` and return a list of the `n` most expensive items from the input list, sorted by price in descending order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to sort the list of items based on their 'price' in descending order.\n   - After sorting, we can simply take the first `n` items from this sorted list, as they will be the most expensive.\n   - Return this list of `n` most expensive items.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function expensive_items(items, n):\n       Sort the items list by 'price' in descending order\n       Select the first n items from the sorted list\n       Return the selected items\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef expensive_items(items, n):\n    # Sort the items by 'price' in descending order\n    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: item['price'], reverse=True)\n    # Select the first n items from the sorted list\n    most_expensive_items = sorted_items[:n]\n    # Return the selected items\n    return most_expensive_items\n```"

These chocolates have the following prices: 1, 12, 5, 10.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ## Problem Restatement\n\n        Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a given amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price, and she cannot buy the same chocolate more than once. Given a list of chocolate prices and the total amount of money Anushka has, determine the maximum number of chocolates she can purchase.\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        To maximize the number of chocolates Anushka can buy, she should start by purchasing the cheapest chocolates first. This way, she can buy as many chocolates as possible before running out of money. The steps to solve this problem are:\n\n        1. Sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order.\n        2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of chocolates bought and a variable to track the total money spent.\n        3. Iterate through the sorted list of prices:\n           - For each price, check if adding this price to the total spent so far is within the budget.\n           - If yes, add the price to the total spent and increment the chocolate counter.\n           - If no, stop the iteration as no more chocolates can be bought without exceeding the budget.\n        4. Return the counter as the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n            sort prices in ascending order\n            count = 0\n            total_spent = 0\n    \n            for price in prices:\n                if total_spent + price <= k:\n                    total_spent += price\n                    count += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n    \n            return count\n        ```\n\n        ## Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n            # Sort the prices in ascending order\n            prices.sort()\n    \n            # Initialize the count of chocolates and the total money spent\n            count = 0\n            total_spent = 0\n    \n            # Iterate over the sorted prices\n            for price in prices:\n                # Check if the current price can be added without exceeding the budget\n                if total_spent + price <= k:\n                    total_spent += price  # Add the price to the total spent\n                    count += 1  # Increment the count of chocolates\n                else:\n                    break  # Stop if the budget is exceeded\n    \n            # Return the maximum number of chocolates that can be bought\n            return count\n        ```\n\n        This code efficiently calculates the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy by sorting the prices and iterating through them, ensuring that the budget is not exceeded.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['7 50', '1 12 5 111 200 1000 10'] Expected output: [{'4'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.
