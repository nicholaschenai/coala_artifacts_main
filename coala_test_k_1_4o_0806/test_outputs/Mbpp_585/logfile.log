INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/585 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an item with a 'name' and a 'price'. The function should also take an integer `n` and return a list of the `n` most expensive items from the input list, sorted by price in descending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, we need to sort the list of items based on their 'price' in descending order.
   - After sorting, we can simply take the first `n` items from this sorted list, as they will be the most expensive.
   - Return this list of `n` most expensive items.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function expensive_items(items, n):
       Sort the items list by 'price' in descending order
       Select the first n items from the sorted list
       Return the selected items
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def expensive_items(items, n):
    # Sort the items by 'price' in descending order
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: item['price'], reverse=True)
    # Select the first n items from the sorted list
    most_expensive_items = sorted_items[:n]
    # Return the selected items
    return most_expensive_items
```

        Give me Chocolate

        Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices.

        Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money.

        Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy? 

        For example, 

        if prices =[1,2,3,4]
        and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items.

        Input Format

        The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend.

        The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i]

        Constraints

        1<= n <= 105

        1<= k <= 109

        1<= prices[i] <= 109



        A chocolate can't be bought multiple times.

        Output Format

        An integer that denotes the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy for her.

        Sample Input

        7 50

        1 12 5 111 200 1000 10

        Sample Output

        4

        Explanation

        she can buy only 4 chocolatess at most. These chocolates have the following prices: 1, 12, 5, 10.

        ## Problem Restatement

        Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a given amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price, and she cannot buy the same chocolate more than once. Given a list of chocolate prices and the total amount of money Anushka has, determine the maximum number of chocolates she can purchase.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        To maximize the number of chocolates Anushka can buy, she should start by purchasing the cheapest chocolates first. This way, she can buy as many chocolates as possible before running out of money. The steps to solve this problem are:

        1. Sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order.
        2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of chocolates bought and a variable to track the total money spent.
        3. Iterate through the sorted list of prices:
           - For each price, check if adding this price to the total spent so far is within the budget.
           - If yes, add the price to the total spent and increment the chocolate counter.
           - If no, stop the iteration as no more chocolates can be bought without exceeding the budget.
        4. Return the counter as the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function maxChocolates(n, k, prices):
            sort prices in ascending order
            count = 0
            total_spent = 0
    
            for price in prices:
                if total_spent + price <= k:
                    total_spent += price
                    count += 1
                else:
                    break
    
            return count
        ```

        ## Python Code

        ```python
        def maxChocolates(n, k, prices):
            # Sort the prices in ascending order
            prices.sort()
    
            # Initialize the count of chocolates and the total money spent
            count = 0
            total_spent = 0
    
            # Iterate over the sorted prices
            for price in prices:
                # Check if the current price can be added without exceeding the budget
                if total_spent + price <= k:
                    total_spent += price  # Add the price to the total spent
                    count += 1  # Increment the count of chocolates
                else:
                    break  # Stop if the budget is exceeded
    
            # Return the maximum number of chocolates that can be bought
            return count
        ```

        This code efficiently calculates the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy by sorting the prices and iterating through them, ensuring that the budget is not exceeded.
