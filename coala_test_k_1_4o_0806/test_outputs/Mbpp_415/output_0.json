    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find a pair of numbers in a given list of integers such that their product is the highest possible among all pairs in the list. The function should return this pair of numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the pair with the highest product, we can sort the list of integers. The two largest numbers in the sorted list will give the highest product. Therefore, we can sort the list and then select the last two elements (the largest two numbers) to form the pair with the highest product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   1. Sort the list of integers in ascending order.\n   2. Select the last two elements from the sorted list.\n   3. Return these two elements as a tuple.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_Product(arr):\n    # Step 1: Sort the array in ascending order\n    arr.sort()\n    \n    # Step 2: Select the last two elements from the sorted array\n    # These are the two largest numbers in the array\n    num1 = arr[-1]\n    num2 = arr[-2]\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the pair as a tuple\n    return (num2, num1)\n```\n\nThis function sorts the input list and returns the last two elements as a tuple, which are the two largest numbers in the list, thus forming the pair with the highest product.",
