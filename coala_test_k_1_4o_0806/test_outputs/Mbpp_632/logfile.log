INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/632 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and moves all the zeroes in the list to the end, while maintaining the order of the non-zero elements.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a new list to store the result.
2. Iterate through the given list and append all non-zero elements to the new list.
3. Count the number of zeroes in the original list.
4. Append the counted number of zeroes to the end of the new list.
5. Return the new list.

## Pseudocode

```
function move_zero(lst):
    result = []
    zero_count = 0
    
    for each element in lst:
        if element is not zero:
            append element to result
        else:
            increment zero_count by 1
    
    for i from 0 to zero_count:
        append 0 to result
    
    return result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def move_zero(lst):
    # Initialize an empty list to store non-zero elements
    result = []
    # Initialize a counter for zeroes
    zero_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each element in the input list
    for element in lst:
        # If the element is not zero, add it to the result list
        if element != 0:
            result.append(element)
        else:
            # If the element is zero, increment the zero counter
            zero_count += 1
    
    # Append the counted number of zeroes to the end of the result list
    result.extend([0] * zero_count)
    
    # Return the modified list with zeroes moved to the end
    return result
```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this pattern generation task, I encountered a few key insights:

    1. **Pattern Understanding**: The main challenge was correctly understanding the pattern generation logic. The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.

    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.

    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.

    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:
    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.
    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.
    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. 

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/632 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and moves all the zeroes in the list to the end, while maintaining the order of the non-zero elements.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Non-Zero Elements**: Traverse the list and collect all non-zero elements in the order they appear.
2. **Count Zeroes**: Count the number of zeroes in the list.
3. **Reconstruct the List**: Create a new list by appending the non-zero elements first, followed by the counted number of zeroes.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty list `non_zero_elements` to store non-zero elements.
2. Initialize a counter `zero_count` to zero.
3. Iterate through each element in the input list:
   - If the element is non-zero, append it to `non_zero_elements`.
   - If the element is zero, increment `zero_count`.
4. Create the result list by concatenating `non_zero_elements` with a list of zeroes of length `zero_count`.
5. Return the result list.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def move_zero(lst):
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty list for non-zero elements
    non_zero_elements = []
    
    # Step 2: Initialize a counter for zeroes
    zero_count = 0
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the list
    for num in lst:
        if num != 0:
            # Collect non-zero elements
            non_zero_elements.append(num)
        else:
            # Count zeroes
            zero_count += 1
    
    # Step 4: Concatenate non-zero elements with zeroes
    result = non_zero_elements + [0] * zero_count
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return result
```

This solution efficiently separates non-zero elements from zeroes and reconstructs the list as required.
