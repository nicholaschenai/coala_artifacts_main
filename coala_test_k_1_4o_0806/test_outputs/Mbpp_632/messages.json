The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.\n\n    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.\n\n    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\n    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:\n    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.\n    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.\n    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

Initialize an empty list `non_zero_elements` to store non-zero elements.\n2. Initialize a counter `zero_count` to zero.\n3. Iterate through each element in the input list:\n   - If the element is non-zero, append it to `non_zero_elements`.\n   - If the element is zero, increment `zero_count`.\n4. Create the result list by concatenating `non_zero_elements` with a list of zeroes of length `zero_count`.\n5. Return the result list.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef move_zero(lst):\n    # Step 1: Initialize an empty list for non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = []\n    \n    # Step 2: Initialize a counter for zeroes\n    zero_count = 0\n    \n    # Step 3: Iterate through the list\n    for num in lst:\n        if num != 0:\n            # Collect non-zero elements\n            non_zero_elements.append(num)\n        else:\n            # Count zeroes\n            zero_count += 1\n    \n    # Step 4: Concatenate non-zero elements with zeroes\n    result = non_zero_elements + [0] * zero_count\n    \n    # Step 5: Return the result\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently separates non-zero elements from zeroes and reconstructs the list as required."
