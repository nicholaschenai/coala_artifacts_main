INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/227 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest of these three numbers.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare them using conditional statements. We can start by assuming the first number is the smallest, then compare it with the second and third numbers to update our assumption if we find a smaller number.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `min_of_three` that takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - Initialize a variable `min_value` with the value of `a`.
   - If `b` is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` to `b`.
   - If `c` is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` to `c`.
   - Return `min_value`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def min_of_three(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    # Start by assuming the first number is the smallest
    min_value = a
    
    # Compare with the second number
    if b < min_value:
        min_value = b
    
    # Compare with the third number
    if c < min_value:
        min_value = c
    
    # Return the smallest number found
    return min_value
```

This function will correctly return the smallest of the three input numbers by comparing them sequentially and updating the minimum value as needed.

    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Minimizing sums
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.
