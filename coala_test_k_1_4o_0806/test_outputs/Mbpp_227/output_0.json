    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest of these three numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare them using conditional statements. We can start by assuming the first number is the smallest, then compare it with the second and third numbers to update our assumption if we find a smaller number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function min_of_three(a, b, c):\n       if a is less than or equal to b and a is less than or equal to c:\n           return a\n       else if b is less than or equal to a and b is less than or equal to c:\n           return b\n       else:\n           return c\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef min_of_three(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Check if 'a' is the smallest among the three numbers\n    if a <= b and a <= c:\n        return a\n    # If not, check if 'b' is the smallest\n    elif b <= a and b <= c:\n        return b\n    # If neither 'a' nor 'b' is the smallest, 'c' must be the smallest\n    else:\n        return c\n```\n\nThis function uses simple conditional checks to determine which of the three numbers is the smallest and returns that number.",
