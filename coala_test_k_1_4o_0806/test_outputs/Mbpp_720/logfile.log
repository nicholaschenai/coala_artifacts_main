INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/720 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a tuple and a dictionary as inputs and returns a new tuple that includes all the elements of the original tuple followed by the dictionary as the last element.

## Conceptual Solution

1. The function will accept two parameters: a tuple and a dictionary.
2. We will create a new tuple by concatenating the original tuple with a single-element tuple containing the dictionary.
3. The result will be a tuple that includes all the elements of the original tuple and the dictionary as the last element.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `add_dict_to_tuple` that takes two parameters: `input_tuple` and `input_dict`.
2. Create a new tuple by concatenating `input_tuple` with a tuple containing `input_dict`.
3. Return the new tuple.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def add_dict_to_tuple(input_tuple: tuple, input_dict: dict) -> tuple:
    # Concatenate the input tuple with a tuple containing the input dictionary
    result_tuple = input_tuple + (input_dict,)
    # Return the resulting tuple
    return result_tuple

Also, here are some of your memories.
Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights:

    1. **Data Structures**: The official solution uses a dictionary to map scores to the number of contestants, which is a neat way to handle the association between scores and contestants. This approach is similar to my use of `zip` to pair scores and contestants, but the dictionary provides direct access to the number of contestants for a given score.

    2. **Sorting and Counting**: Both solutions involve sorting the scores and counting the number of decreases in the number of contestants. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to compare consecutive elements, which is a clean and efficient way to count decreases.

    3. **Handling Ties**: The official solution uses a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score and then sorts these groups. This is an effective way to handle ties, ensuring that problems with the same difficulty are sorted by their indices.

    4. **Output**: The official solution constructs a final list of problem indices by iterating over sorted difficulty scores and their associated problem indices. This approach is clear and ensures the correct order of output.

    Overall, both solutions are similar in logic and efficiency. The official solution's use of dictionaries for grouping and sorting is a useful technique for handling ties and organizing data, which can be applied to similar problems in the future.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Inputs and Outputs**: 
   - Input: A tuple and a dictionary.
   - Output: A new tuple that contains all elements of the original tuple and the dictionary as the last element.

2. **Approach**:
   - Convert the input tuple to a list to allow appending.
   - Append the dictionary to this list.
   - Convert the list back to a tuple.
   - Return the new tuple.

## Pseudocode

1. Define the function `add_dict_to_tuple` with parameters `input_tuple` and `input_dict`.
2. Convert `input_tuple` to a list and store it in a variable `temp_list`.
3. Append `input_dict` to `temp_list`.
4. Convert `temp_list` back to a tuple and store it in a variable `result_tuple`.
5. Return `result_tuple`.
