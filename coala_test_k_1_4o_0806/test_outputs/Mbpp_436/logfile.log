INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/436 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the negative numbers from the original list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through each number in the input list.
   - For each number, we will check if it is negative (i.e., less than zero).
   - If a number is negative, we will add it to a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list containing all the negative numbers.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function neg_nos with parameter nums (a list of integers)
       Initialize an empty list called negative_numbers
       For each number in nums
           If the number is less than zero
               Append the number to negative_numbers
       Return negative_numbers
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def neg_nos(nums):
    # Initialize an empty list to store negative numbers
    negative_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # Check if the number is negative
        if num < 0:
            # If negative, append it to the negative_numbers list
            negative_numbers.append(num)
    
    # Return the list of negative numbers
    return negative_numbers
```

This function will correctly filter out and return only the negative numbers from the input list.

    [Task]:
        Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
        Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
        Example 1:
        Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
        Output: 13 
        Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

        Example 2:
        Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
        Output: 6
        Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

        Example 3:
        Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
        Output: 50

Â 
        Constraints:

        1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
        nums.length == n
        1 <= nums[i] <= 100
        1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers. We need to compute the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays of `nums`, sort these sums in non-decreasing order, and then return the sum of the elements from index `left` to `right` (1-based index) in this sorted list. The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Generate Subarray Sums**: For each possible subarray in `nums`, calculate its sum. This involves iterating over all possible starting and ending indices of subarrays.

        2. **Sort the Sums**: Once all subarray sums are computed, sort them in non-decreasing order.

        3. **Calculate the Range Sum**: Sum the elements from the `left` to `right` indices in the sorted list of sums. Since the indices are 1-based, adjust them to 0-based for Python list indexing.

        4. **Modulo Operation**: Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function rangeSum(nums, n, left, right):
            subarray_sums = []
    
            for start in range(n):
                current_sum = 0
                for end in range(start, n):
                    current_sum += nums[end]
                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
    
            sort subarray_sums
    
            result = 0
            for i from left-1 to right-1:
                result += subarray_sums[i]
    
            return result modulo (10^9 + 7)
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
                # List to store all subarray sums
                subarray_sums = []
        
                # Calculate all subarray sums
                for start in range(n):
                    current_sum = 0
                    for end in range(start, n):
                        current_sum += nums[end]
                        subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
        
                # Sort the subarray sums
                subarray_sums.sort()
        
                # Calculate the sum from index left to right (1-based index)
                result = 0
                for i in range(left - 1, right):
                    result += subarray_sums[i]
        
                # Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7
                return result % (10**9 + 7)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - We first initialize an empty list `subarray_sums` to store the sums of all possible subarrays.
        - We use two nested loops to iterate over all possible subarrays. The outer loop sets the starting index, and the inner loop calculates the sum for each subarray starting at that index.
        - After computing all subarray sums, we sort them.
        - We then sum the elements from the `left-1` to `right-1` indices in the sorted list (adjusting for 0-based indexing).
        - Finally, we return the sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
