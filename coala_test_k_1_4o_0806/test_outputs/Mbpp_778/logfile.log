INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/778 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of elements and groups consecutive duplicate elements into sublists. For example, if the input list is `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]`, the output should be `[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Start with an empty list to hold the result.
   - Iterate through the input list.
   - Use a temporary list to keep track of the current group of consecutive duplicates.
   - For each element in the list:
     - If the temporary list is empty or the current element is the same as the last element in the temporary list, add the element to the temporary list.
     - If the current element is different from the last element in the temporary list, add the temporary list to the result list and start a new temporary list with the current element.
   - After the loop, add the last temporary list to the result list.
   - Return the result list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):
       if lst is empty:
           return an empty list
       
       result = []
       current_group = [lst[0]]
       
       for each element in lst starting from the second element:
           if element is equal to the last element in current_group:
               add element to current_group
           else:
               add current_group to result
               start a new current_group with the element
       
       add the last current_group to result
       return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):
    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list
    if not lst:
        return []
    
    # Initialize the result list and the first group with the first element
    result = []
    current_group = [lst[0]]
    
    # Iterate over the list starting from the second element
    for element in lst[1:]:
        # If the current element is the same as the last element in the current group
        if element == current_group[-1]:
            # Add the element to the current group
            current_group.append(element)
        else:
            # Otherwise, add the current group to the result
            result.append(current_group)
            # Start a new group with the current element
            current_group = [element]
    
    # Add the last group to the result
    result.append(current_group)
    
    # Return the result list
    return result
```

This solution iterates through the list once, maintaining a temporary list for the current group of consecutive duplicates, and appends it to the result list whenever a new element is encountered. This ensures that all consecutive duplicates are grouped correctly.

        So you have again to build a method, that creates new arrays, that can be flattened!

        # Shorter: You have to unflatten a list/an array.

        You get an array of integers and have to unflatten it by these rules:
        ```
        - You have to do several runs. The depth is the number of runs, you have to do.
        - In every run you have to switch the direction. First run from left, next run from right. Next left...
        Every run has these rules:
        - You start at the first number (from the direction).
        - Take for every number x the remainder of the division by the number of still available elements (from 
          this position!) to have the number for the next decision.
        - If the remainder-value is smaller than 3, take this number x (NOT the remainder-Value) direct
          for the new array and continue with the next number.
        - If the remainder-value (e.g. 3) is greater than 2, take the next remainder-value-number (e.g. 3)
          elements/numbers (inclusive the number x, NOT the remainder-value) as a sub-array in the new array.
          Continue with the next number/element AFTER this taken elements/numbers.
        - Every sub-array in the array is independent and is only one element for the progress on the array. 
          For every sub-array you have to follow the same rules for unflatten it.
          The direction is always the same as the actual run.
        ```

        Sounds complicated? Yeah, thats why, this is the harder version...
        Maybe an example will help.

        ```
         Array: [4, 5, 1, 7, 1] Depth: 2 -> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]
 
        Steps: 
        First run: (start from left side!)
        1. The first number is 4. The number is smaller than the number of remaining elements, so it is the remainder-value (4 / 5 -> remainder 4).
           So 4 numbers (4, 5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the new array.
        2. The next number is 1. It is smaller than 3, so the 1 is added direct to the new array.
        Now we have --> [[4, 5, 1, 7], 1]

        Second run: (start from right side!)
        1. The last number (first from other side) is 1. So the 1 is added direct to the new array.
        2. The next element is the sub-array. So we use the rules for this.
        2a.The last number is 7. There are 4 elements in the array. So for the next decision you have to
           take the remainder from 7 / 4 -> 3. So 3 numbers (5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the 
           new array.
        2b.Now there is the 4 and only one element last in this array. 4 / 1 -> remainder 0. It is smaller
           than 3. So the 4 is added direct to the new array.
        Now we have --> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]
        ```

        The given array will always contain numbers. There will only be numbers > 0.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ## Problem Restatement

        We need to transform a list of integers into a nested list structure based on specific rules. The transformation process involves multiple runs, alternating the direction of processing (left-to-right, then right-to-left, and so on). Each run involves checking each number in the list and deciding whether to include it directly or as part of a sub-array, based on the remainder of the division of the number by the count of remaining elements.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Initialize the Process**: Start with the given list and the specified depth of transformation.

        2. **Iterate Over Depth**: For each depth level, process the list in alternating directions:
           - **Left-to-Right**: Start from the beginning of the list.
           - **Right-to-Left**: Start from the end of the list.

        3. **Process Each Element**:
           - Calculate the remainder of the current element divided by the number of remaining elements.
           - If the remainder is less than 3, add the element directly to the new list.
           - If the remainder is 3 or more, create a sub-array with the next `remainder` elements and add it to the new list.

        4. **Recursive Processing**: If a sub-array is created, apply the same rules recursively to the sub-array.

        5. **Output the Result**: After processing all depth levels, the list should be fully transformed.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function unflatten(flat_array, depth):
            for each level in depth:
                if level is even:
                    process from left to right
                else:
                    process from right to left
        
                initialize new_array
                while there are elements in flat_array:
                    calculate remainder = current_element % remaining_elements
                    if remainder < 3:
                        add current_element to new_array
                    else:
                        create sub-array with next 'remainder' elements
                        add sub-array to new_array
                        skip 'remainder' elements in flat_array
        
                set flat_array to new_array for next level

            return flat_array
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def process_subarray(array, direction):
            result = []
            i = 0 if direction == 'left' else len(array) - 1
            step = 1 if direction == 'left' else -1
    
            while 0 <= i < len(array):
                remaining_elements = len(array) - i if direction == 'left' else i + 1
                current = array[i]
                remainder = current % remaining_elements
        
                if remainder < 3:
                    result.append(current)
                    i += step
                else:
                    if direction == 'left':
                        subarray = array[i:i + remainder]
                        result.append(process_subarray(subarray, direction))
                        i += remainder
                    else:
                        subarray = array[i - remainder + 1:i + 1]
                        result.append(process_subarray(subarray, direction))
                        i -= remainder
    
            return result

        def unflatten(flat_array, depth):
            direction = 'left'
            for _ in range(depth):
                flat_array = process_subarray(flat_array, direction)
                direction = 'right' if direction == 'left' else 'left'
    
            return flat_array
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **process_subarray**: This helper function processes a given array in a specified direction ('left' or 'right'). It calculates the remainder for each element and decides whether to add it directly or as part of a sub-array.
        - **unflatten**: This function manages the overall process, iterating over the specified depth and alternating the direction of processing. It uses `process_subarray` to transform the list at each depth level.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/778 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to transform a list of integers by grouping consecutive duplicate elements into sublists. The goal is to iterate through the list and whenever we encounter consecutive duplicates, we group them together in a sublist.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start with an empty list to store the result and a temporary list to keep track of the current group of duplicates.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Go through each element in the list.
   - If the current element is the same as the last element in the temporary list (or if the temporary list is empty), add it to the temporary list.
   - If the current element is different, add the temporary list to the result list and start a new temporary list with the current element.

3. **Finalize the Result**: After the loop, add any remaining elements in the temporary list to the result list.

4. **Return the Result**: The result list will contain sublists of consecutive duplicates.

## Pseudocode

```
function pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):
    initialize result as an empty list
    initialize temp as an empty list

    for each element in lst:
        if temp is empty or element is equal to the last element in temp:
            add element to temp
        else:
            add temp to result
            reset temp to a new list containing the current element

    if temp is not empty:
        add temp to result

    return result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):
    # Initialize the result list and a temporary list to hold current duplicates
    result = []
    temp = []

    # Iterate through each element in the input list
    for element in lst:
        # If temp is empty or the current element is the same as the last in temp
        if not temp or element == temp[-1]:
            # Add the element to the temp list
            temp.append(element)
        else:
            # If the current element is different, add the temp list to result
            result.append(temp)
            # Start a new temp list with the current element
            temp = [element]

    # After the loop, add any remaining elements in temp to result
    if temp:
        result.append(temp)

    # Return the result list containing sublists of consecutive duplicates
    return result
```

This solution iterates through the list once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

This solution iterates through the list once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
