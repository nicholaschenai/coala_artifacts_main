        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of elements and groups consecutive duplicate elements into sublists. For example, if the input list is `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]`, the output should be `[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start with an empty list to hold the result.\n   - Iterate through the input list.\n   - Use a temporary list to keep track of the current group of consecutive duplicates.\n   - For each element in the list:\n     - If the temporary list is empty or the current element is the same as the last element in the temporary list, add the element to the temporary list.\n     - If the current element is different from the last element in the temporary list, add the temporary list to the result list and start a new temporary list with the current element.\n   - After the loop, add the last temporary list to the result list.\n   - Return the result list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):\n       if lst is empty:\n           return an empty list\n       \n       result = []\n       current_group = [lst[0]]\n       \n       for each element in lst starting from the second element:\n           if element is equal to the last element in current_group:\n               add element to current_group\n           else:\n               add current_group to result\n               start a new current_group with the element\n       \n       add the last current_group to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):\n    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list\n    if not lst:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize the result list and the first group with the first element\n    result = []\n    current_group = [lst[0]]\n    \n    # Iterate over the list starting from the second element\n    for element in lst[1:]:\n        # If the current element is the same as the last element in the current group\n        if element == current_group[-1]:\n            # Add the element to the current group\n            current_group.append(element)\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, add the current group to the result\n            result.append(current_group)\n            # Start a new group with the current element\n            current_group = [element]\n    \n    # Add the last group to the result\n    result.append(current_group)\n    \n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list once, maintaining a temporary list for the current group of consecutive duplicates, and appends it to the result list whenever a new element is encountered. This ensures that all consecutive duplicates are grouped correctly."

The depth is the number of runs, you have to do.\n        - In every run you have to switch the direction. First run from left, next run from right. Next left...\n        Every run has these rules:\n        - You start at the first number (from the direction).\n        - Take for every number x the remainder of the division by the number of still available elements (from \n          this position!) to have the number for the next decision.\n        - If the remainder-value is smaller than 3, take this number x (NOT the remainder-Value) direct\n          for the new array and continue with the next number.\n        - If the remainder-value (e.g. 3) is greater than 2, take the next remainder-value-number (e.g. 3)\n          elements/numbers (inclusive the number x, NOT the remainder-value) as a sub-array in the new array.\n          Continue with the next number/element AFTER this taken elements/numbers.\n        - Every sub-array in the array is independent and is only one element for the progress on the array. \n          For every sub-array you have to follow the same rules for unflatten it.\n          The direction is always the same as the actual run.\n        ```\n\n        Sounds complicated?

The first number is 4. The number is smaller than the number of remaining elements, so it is the remainder-value (4 / 5 -> remainder 4).\n           So 4 numbers (4, 5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the new array.\n        2. The next number is 1. It is smaller than 3, so the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n        Now we have --> [[4, 5, 1, 7], 1]\n\n        Second run: (start from right side!)\n        1. The last number (first from other side) is 1. So the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n        2. The next element is the sub-array. So we use the rules for this.\n        2a.The last number is 7. There are 4 elements in the array. So for the next decision you have to\n           take the remainder from 7 / 4 -> 3. So 3 numbers (5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the \n           new array.\n        2b.Now there is the 4 and only one element last in this array. 4 / 1 -> remainder 0. It is smaller\n           than 3. So the 4 is added direct to the new array.\n        Now we have --> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n        ```\n\n        The given array will always contain numbers. There will only be numbers > 0.\n\n\n        Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\n        I have created other katas.

The transformation process involves multiple runs, alternating the direction of processing (left-to-right, then right-to-left, and so on).
