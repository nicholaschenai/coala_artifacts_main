    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all even factors of a given integer. A factor of a number is an integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder. An even factor is simply a factor that is an even number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Iterate through all numbers from 1 to the given number (inclusive).\n   - Check if a number is a factor of the given number by verifying if it divides the number without a remainder.\n   - Further check if the factor is even.\n   - If both conditions are met, add the factor to a running total.\n   - Return the total sum of all even factors.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function sumofFactors(n):\n       initialize sum to 0\n       for each number i from 1 to n:\n           if n is divisible by i:\n               if i is even:\n                   add i to sum\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sumofFactors(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of even factors to 0\n    sum_even_factors = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a factor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # Check if the factor is even\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                # Add the even factor to the sum\n                sum_even_factors += i\n    \n    # Return the total sum of even factors\n    return sum_even_factors\n```",
