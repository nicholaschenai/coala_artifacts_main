INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/453 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all even factors of a given integer. A factor of a number is an integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder. An even factor is simply a factor that is an even number.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Identify all factors of the given number.
2. Filter out the even factors from the list of all factors.
3. Sum up these even factors.
4. Return the sum.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a variable `sum_even_factors` to 0 to keep track of the sum of even factors.
2. Loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number (inclusive).
   - For each number `i`, check if it is a factor of the given number by verifying if the remainder of the division of the number by `i` is zero.
   - If `i` is a factor and `i` is even, add `i` to `sum_even_factors`.
3. After the loop, return `sum_even_factors`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def sumofFactors(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum of even factors to 0
    sum_even_factors = 0
    
    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if i is a factor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # Check if the factor is even
            if i % 2 == 0:
                # Add the even factor to the sum
                sum_even_factors += i
    
    # Return the sum of even factors
    return sum_even_factors
```

This code will correctly calculate the sum of all even factors of a given integer `n`. It iterates through all possible factors, checks if they are even, and accumulates their sum.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.

    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.

    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. 

    Here is the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
            steps = 0
            while n != 1:
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    n //= 2
                else:
                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        n += 1
                steps += 1
            return steps
    ```
