    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine if two given numbers differ by exactly one bit in their binary representation. This means that when you compare the binary forms of the two numbers, only one bit position should be different.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find out if two numbers differ by exactly one bit, we can use the XOR (exclusive OR) operation. The XOR operation will result in a binary number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different. If the result of the XOR operation is a power of two, it means that only one bit is set to 1, indicating that the two numbers differ by exactly one bit.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a, b):\n       Perform XOR operation on a and b, store the result in variable xor_result\n       Check if xor_result is a power of two\n       Return True if xor_result is a power of two, otherwise return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n    # Perform XOR operation on a and b\n    xor_result = a ^ b\n    \n    # Check if xor_result is a power of two\n    # A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set\n    # This can be checked using the condition: xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0\n    # Also ensure xor_result is not zero, as zero means no bits are set\n    return xor_result != 0 and (xor_result & (xor_result - 1)) == 0\n```\n\nThis function uses the XOR operation to determine if two numbers differ by exactly one bit. The check `(xor_result & (xor_result - 1)) == 0` ensures that `xor_result` is a power of two, which means only one bit is set.",
