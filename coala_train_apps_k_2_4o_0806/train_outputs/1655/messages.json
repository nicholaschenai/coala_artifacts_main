Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:\n        - White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval\n        - Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.\n        - Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.\n        - Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.\n        You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n        - The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.\n        - The $i^{\\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $ 1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5 $\n        - $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $\n        - The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n        - $ 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\n        -----Sample Input:-----\n        1\n        3\n        3 7\n        2 5\n        6 9\n\n        -----Sample Output:-----\n        100\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:\n        - $[2, 3) \\cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.\n        - $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.\n        - $[3, 5] \\cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.\n        - Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.\n        Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them.

If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

The function `maximizeGreen` is defined but not called, and the input is not being read from standard input.\n\n        2. **Interval Sorting and Coloring Logic**: The logic for sorting intervals and deciding their colors seems correct in principle, but it might not be correctly implemented or might not handle all edge cases.\n\n        3. **Greedy Approach**: The greedy approach assumes that we can decide the color of each interval based on the last interval colored. This might not always lead to the optimal solution if there are complex overlaps.\n\n        4. **Function Call**: The function `maximizeGreen` is defined but not called in the code.

The official solution correctly handles the output by ensuring the list of colors is not nested and is followed by the count of triangles. This highlights the importance of carefully matching the expected output format.\n\n2. **Collinearity Check**: My solution used a determinant method to check for collinearity, which is mathematically sound. However, the official solution uses a different approach by calculating the area of the triangle using Heron's formula. This method is effective because it directly checks if the area is greater than zero, ensuring the points are not collinear.\n\n3. **Efficiency and Clarity**: The official solution is concise and leverages Python's dictionary and list comprehensions effectively. It groups points by color, calculates possible triangles using combinations, and determines the maximum number of triangles in a straightforward manner. This approach is both efficient and easy to understand.\n\n4. **Use of Built-in Functions**: The use of `itertools.combinations` in both my solution and the official one is crucial for generating all possible sets of three points.

It keeps track of the maximum number of triangles formed by any color and the colors that achieve this maximum.

It is applicable in computational geometry, computer graphics, and spatial data analysis where determining the number of possible triangles from a set of points is required. This can be useful in applications such as geographic information systems (GIS), computer-aided design (CAD), and any field that requires spatial reasoning or pattern recognition.
