## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        
```

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of positive integers. We need to calculate the sum of all possible non-empty continuous subarrays, sort these sums, and then find the sum of a specific range of these sorted sums. The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, generate all possible non-empty continuous subarrays from the given array.
   - Calculate the sum for each of these subarrays.
   - Store all these sums in a list.
   - Sort the list of sums in non-decreasing order.
   - Calculate the sum of the elements in this sorted list from the `left` index to the `right` index (1-based index).
   - Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize an empty list `subarray_sums`
   For each starting index `i` from 0 to n-1:
       Initialize `current_sum` to 0
       For each ending index `j` from `i` to n-1:
           Add `nums[j]` to `current_sum`
           Append `current_sum` to `subarray_sums`
   Sort `subarray_sums`
   Calculate the sum of elements from index `left-1` to `right-1` in `subarray_sums`
   Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # Initialize an empty list to store the sums of subarrays
        subarray_sums = []
        
        # Generate all possible subarrays
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                # Calculate the sum of the subarray from i to j
                current_sum += nums[j]
                # Append the sum to the list
                subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
        
        # Sort the list of subarray sums
        subarray_sums.sort()
        
        # Calculate the sum of the elements from index left-1 to right-1
        result = sum(subarray_sums[left-1:right])
        
        # Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7
        return result % (10**9 + 7)
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and efficiently calculates the required sum of subarray sums within the specified range.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of summing multiples of 10 up to a given number \( N \). However, there are some differences in implementation that are worth noting:

    1. **Efficiency and Simplicity:**
       - The official solution is more concise. It directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to \( N \) by using `n -= n % 10`, which is a straightforward way to adjust \( N \) to the nearest lower multiple of 10.
       - It then divides by 10 and uses the arithmetic series formula in a single line to compute the sum, which is efficient and easy to read.

    2. **Use of Integer Division:**
       - My solution uses integer division (`//`) to ensure that the operations remain within integer arithmetic, which is important for large numbers to avoid floating-point precision issues.
       - The official solution uses regular division (`/`), which in Python 3 results in a float. This is acceptable here because the arithmetic operations are simple and Python handles large integers well, but using integer division is generally safer for integer-only operations.

    3. **Code Readability:**
       - My solution separates the logic into a function and uses comments to explain each step, which can be helpful for understanding and maintaining the code.
       - The official solution is more compact and may be preferred in competitive programming settings where brevity is valued.

    Overall, both solutions are correct and efficient, but the official solution demonstrates a more concise approach that leverages Python's handling of arithmetic operations effectively. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding both concise and verbose coding styles, as well as the implications of using different types of division in Python.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: 
           - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.
           - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.

        2. **Constraints**:
           - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.
           - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.

        3. **Combinatorial Approach**:
           - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:
             - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.
             - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.
           - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.
           - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.

        4. **Modulo Operation**:
           - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):
            MOD = 10^9 + 7

            results = []
            for each query (I, K):
                if K > I or K > N:
                    results.append(0)
                else:
                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD
                    count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD
                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD
                    results.append(result)
            return results

        function precompute_factorials(N):
            factorials = [1] * (N+1)
            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)
            for i from 2 to N:
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD
            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)
            for i from N-1 down to 1:
                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD
            return factorials, inverse_factorials

        function C(n, k):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD
        ```

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array of positive integers `nums` of length `n`. We need to compute the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays, sort these sums in non-decreasing order, and then return the sum of the elements from index `left` to `right` (1-based index) in this sorted list. The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Generate Subarray Sums**: 
   - For each starting index `i` in the array, calculate the sum of all subarrays starting at `i` and ending at any index `j` where `i <= j < n`.
   - This can be done by iterating over the array and maintaining a running sum for each starting index.

2. **Sort the Sums**:
   - Collect all the subarray sums and sort them in non-decreasing order.

3. **Calculate the Required Sum**:
   - Sum the elements from index `left` to `right` in the sorted list of sums. Since the indices are 1-based, adjust them to 0-based for Python list indexing.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be large, return the sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

```
function rangeSum(nums, n, left, right):
    MOD = 10^9 + 7
    subarray_sums = []

    for i from 0 to n-1:
        current_sum = 0
        for j from i to n-1:
            current_sum += nums[j]
            subarray_sums.append(current_sum)

    sort subarray_sums

    result = 0
    for k from left-1 to right-1:
        result += subarray_sums[k]

    return result % MOD
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        subarray_sums = []

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to compute all possible subarray sums from a given list of integers, sort these sums, and then calculate the sum of a specified range of these sorted sums. The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.

The strategy that worked involved iterating over the array to compute all subarray sums by maintaining a running sum for each starting index. This approach ensures that all possible subarray sums are captured. Sorting these sums allows us to easily access the required range of sums. The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result remains within the limits of typical integer operations.

The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray generation and manipulation, as well as handling large numbers with modulo operations. The final implementation was efficient and passed all test cases successfully. 

Here's the key code snippet for future reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        subarray_sums = []

        for i in range(n):
            current_sum = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                current_sum += nums[j]
                subarray_sums.append(current_sum)

        subarray_sums.sort()
        result = sum(subarray_sums[left-1:right]) % MOD

        return result
```

This problem was a good exercise in handling subarrays and sorting, which are common tasks in algorithmic challenges.

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

1. **Prefix Sum Optimization**:
   - The official solution uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate subarray sums. This is a powerful technique that reduces the time complexity of calculating subarray sums from \(O(n^2)\) to \(O(n)\) for each query. By precomputing prefix sums, the solution can quickly determine the sum of any subarray in constant time.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - The solution employs a two-pointer technique to count subarrays with sums less than or equal to a given score. This is a clever way to efficiently handle the problem of finding subarray sums within a certain range, which is crucial for the binary search step.

3. **Binary Search for K-th Smallest Sum**:
   - The use of binary search to find the k-th smallest subarray sum is an insightful approach. By leveraging the properties of prefix sums and the two-pointer technique, the solution can efficiently determine the k-th smallest sum without explicitly sorting all subarray sums.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The solution correctly handles large numbers by using modular arithmetic, ensuring that the result remains within the constraints of typical integer limits.

5. **Complexity Considerations**:
   - The official solution is more efficient than a straightforward approach that generates all subarray sums and sorts them. It reduces the time complexity significantly, making it suitable for larger input sizes.

Overall, the official solution demonstrates a sophisticated use of algorithmic techniques like prefix sums, two-pointer methods, and binary search to solve the problem efficiently. This approach is a great example of how combining multiple algorithmic strategies can lead to an optimal solution.

[Problem]
    Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
    Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
    Output: 13 
    Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
    Output: 50

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
    nums.length == n
    1 <= nums[i] <= 100
    1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2
