Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.\n\nHopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). \n\nDuring one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches.

        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nYou are playing a game where you start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. Specifically, you can:\n- Trade 1 stick to get `x` sticks.\n- Trade `y` sticks to get 1 coal.\n\nYour goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches. You have `t` test cases to solve.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.\n   - You start with 1 stick.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed:**\n   - You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals.\n   - Total sticks needed = `k + k * y`.\n\n3. **Determine Trades for Sticks:**\n   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k + k * y - 1` additional sticks.\n   - Each trade for sticks gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick in the trade).\n   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{trades\\_for\\_sticks} = \\lceil \\frac{k + k \\cdot y - 1}{x - 1} \\rceil\n     \\]\n   - This can be computed using integer arithmetic as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{trades\\_for\\_sticks} = \\frac{k + k \\cdot y - 1 + (x - 2)}{x - 1}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Trades for Coal:**\n   - You need exactly `k` trades to get `k` coals.\n\n5. **Total Trades:**\n   - The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coal.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        x, y, k = test_case\n        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)\n        trades_for_coal = k\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal\n        append total_trades to results\n    return results\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for i in range(t):\n        x, y, k = test_cases[i]\n        \n        # Calculate total sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y\n        \n        # Calculate trades needed to get enough sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)\n        \n        # Calculate trades needed to get enough coal\n        trades_for_coal = k\n        \n        # Total trades is the sum of both\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal\n        \n        results.append(total_trades)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# t = 5\n# test_cases = [(2, 1, 5), (42, 13, 24), (12, 11, 12), (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000), (2, 1000000000, 1000000000)]\n# print(minimum_trades(t, test_cases))\n```\n\nThis solution reads the number of test cases and their respective parameters, calculates the minimum number of trades needed for each test case, and outputs the results."

He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.\n        The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! \n        The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.\n        Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.\n        Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.\n        Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?\n        Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.\n        The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! \n        The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.\n        Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.\n        Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.\n        Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?\n        Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

Here's the revised solution:\n\n        ```python\n        def minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N, K, M = test_case['N'], test_case['K'], test_case['M']\n                A = test_case['A']\n                B = test_case['B']\n                C = test_case['C']\n                D = test_case['D']\n        \n                # Sort white buttons in descending order\n                C.sort(reverse=True)\n                # Sort black buttons in ascending order\n                D.sort()\n        \n                # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n                for i in range(N):\n                    j = 0\n                    while j < len(C):\n                        if A[i] >= C[j]:\n                            A[i] -= C[j]\n                            C.pop(j)\n                        else:\n                            j += 1\n        \n                # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n                for i in range(N):\n                    j = 0\n                    while j < len(D):\n                        if B[i] + D[j] <= A[i]:\n                            B[i] += D[j]\n                            D.pop(j)\n                        else:\n                            j += 1\n        \n                # Calculate total uncompleted tasks\n                total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))\n                results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            index = 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N, K, M = int(data[index]), int(data[index+1]), int(data[index+2])\n                index += 3\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n                index += N\n                B = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n                index += N\n                C = list(map(int, data[index:index+K]))\n                index += K\n                D = list(map(int, data[index:index+M]))\n                index += M\n        \n                test_cases.append({\n                    'N': N,\n                    'K': K,\n                    'M': M,\n                    'A': A,\n                    'B': B,\n                    'C': C,\n                    'D': D\n                })\n    \n            minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Key Changes:\n        - **Iterative Button Application**: The code now uses a `while` loop to apply as many buttons as possible for each day, ensuring that the constraints are respected.\n        - **Button Removal**: Once a button is used, it is removed from the list to prevent reuse.\n        - **Order of Operations**: The order of applying white and black buttons is maintained, but the logic ensures that each button is used optimally.\n\n        This solution should correctly minimize the uncompleted tasks by using the buttons in the most effective way possible.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['1', '4 2 2', '5 7 6 1', '3 3 1 1', '6 3', '1 4'] Expected output: [{'3'}] # Execution output: ['-3']\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Failure\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.\n   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k - 1` additional sticks.\n   - You need `k` coals, which requires `k * y` sticks (since each coal requires `y` sticks).\n   - Therefore, you need a total of `k * y + k - 1` sticks.\n   - Use the first trade to get enough sticks. For each trade, you gain `x - 1` sticks (since you lose 1 stick to gain `x` sticks).\n   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required number of sticks.\n   - Add the number of trades needed to get `k` coals.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   For each test case:\n       Calculate total_sticks_needed = k * y + k - 1\n       Calculate trades_for_sticks = ceil((total_sticks_needed) / (x - 1))\n       Calculate total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n       Output total_trades\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for x, y, k in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the total number of sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k * y + k - 1\n        \n        # Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks\n        # Each trade gives us (x - 1) additional sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)\n        \n        # Total trades include trades for sticks and trades for coals\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(total_trades)\n    \n    # Output all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Number of test cases\nt = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\n\n# Read each test case\nfor _ in range(t):\n    x = int(data[index])\n    y = int(data[index + 1])\n    k = int(data[index + 2])\n    test_cases.append((x, y, k))\n    index += 3\n\n# Call the function\nminimum_trades(t, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case to calculate the minimum number of trades needed, and outputs the result for each test case."

        "content": "In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft `k` torches, given specific trading rules for sticks and coal. The core concept was to efficiently manage resources (sticks) through trading to meet the requirements for crafting torches.\n\nThe key insight was to calculate the total number of sticks needed, which is `k * y + k - 1`, where `k * y` sticks are needed for coal and `k - 1` additional sticks are needed to reach `k` sticks from the initial 1 stick. The challenge was to determine how many trades are required to accumulate these sticks using the first trade option, which gives `x - 1` additional sticks per trade.\n\nThe solution involved calculating the number of trades needed to gather the required sticks using integer division and ceiling logic, and then adding the number of trades needed to acquire `k` coals. The formula `(total_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)` was used to effectively compute the ceiling of the division without using floating-point operations, which is crucial for handling large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of understanding resource management and trade-offs in algorithmic problems, as well as the utility of integer arithmetic for efficient computation. The solution was implemented successfully and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach."

Both approaches focused on calculating the total number of sticks needed and determining the number of trades required to acquire those sticks and the necessary coal.\n\nKey insights from the problem-solving process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Trade Dynamics:**\n   - The problem required understanding how to maximize stick acquisition through trades and then using those sticks to acquire coal. This involved calculating the total number of sticks needed and then determining how many trades would be necessary to achieve that number.\n\n2. **Mathematical Calculation:**\n   - The core of the solution was the formula to calculate the number of trades needed to gather enough sticks.

        "content": "\n[description for function: minimum_trades]\nThe function calculates the minimum number of trades required for each test case to obtain a specified number of sticks and coals. For each test case, it computes the total number of sticks needed by multiplying the number of coals by the number of sticks per coal and adding the number of coals minus one. It then determines the number of trades required to acquire the necessary sticks, considering that each trade provides a certain number of additional sticks. The total number of trades is the sum of trades needed for sticks and the number of coals. The function stores the result for each test case and prints the results sequentially.\n\n[end of description]\nThis problem is useful in scenarios where you need to optimize resource acquisition through trading, especially when there are constraints on the number of resources you can trade at a time. It is applicable in game theory, resource management, and economic simulations where you need to determine the minimum number of transactions to achieve a goal. The solution involves calculating the total resources needed and determining the optimal sequence of trades to minimize the number of transactions. This approach can be applied to any situation where you have two types of trades or exchanges and need to balance them to achieve a target efficiently."
