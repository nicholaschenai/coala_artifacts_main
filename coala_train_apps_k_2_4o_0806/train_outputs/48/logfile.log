## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

You are playing a game where you start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. Specifically, you can:
- Trade 1 stick to get `x` sticks.
- Trade `y` sticks to get 1 coal.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches. You have `t` test cases to solve.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.
   - You start with 1 stick.

2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed:**
   - You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals.
   - Total sticks needed = `k + k * y`.

3. **Determine Trades for Sticks:**
   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k + k * y - 1` additional sticks.
   - Each trade for sticks gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick in the trade).
   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{trades\_for\_sticks} = \lceil \frac{k + k \cdot y - 1}{x - 1} \rceil
     \]
   - This can be computed using integer arithmetic as:
     \[
     \text{trades\_for\_sticks} = \frac{k + k \cdot y - 1 + (x - 2)}{x - 1}
     \]

4. **Calculate Trades for Coal:**
   - You need exactly `k` trades to get `k` coals.

5. **Total Trades:**
   - The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coal.

### Pseudocode

```
function minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        x, y, k = test_case
        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y
        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)
        trades_for_coal = k
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal
        append total_trades to results
    return results
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        x, y, k = test_cases[i]
        
        # Calculate total sticks needed
        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y
        
        # Calculate trades needed to get enough sticks
        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)
        
        # Calculate trades needed to get enough coal
        trades_for_coal = k
        
        # Total trades is the sum of both
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal
        
        results.append(total_trades)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# t = 5
# test_cases = [(2, 1, 5), (42, 13, 24), (12, 11, 12), (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000), (2, 1000000000, 1000000000)]
# print(minimum_trades(t, test_cases))
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and their respective parameters, calculates the minimum number of trades needed for each test case, and outputs the results.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal).

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
        The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
        The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
        Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
        Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
        Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
        Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
        - The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
        - The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
        - The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
        - The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

        -----Output-----
        - In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
        - 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
        - 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5

        6 3
        1 4

        Output:
        3

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1.
        In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
        Use black button 1 on the first day.
        Use black button 4 on the second day.
        Use white button 3 on the third day.
        The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
        5 7 3 1
        4 7 1 1
        So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong.

        ### Problem Analysis

        1. **Objective**: Minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.
        2. **Constraints**:
           - White buttons can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.
           - Black buttons can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.

        ### Solution Analysis

        1. **Sorting**:
           - White buttons are sorted in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks.
           - Black buttons are sorted in ascending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.

        2. **Button Application**:
           - For each day, attempt to use the largest possible white button first.
           - Then, attempt to use the smallest possible black button.

        ### Potential Issues

        1. **Button Usage**:
           - The current approach uses each button only once per day, but it might be more optimal to use multiple buttons on a single day if possible.
           - The logic for applying buttons might not be correctly implemented, especially in terms of when to stop using buttons.

        2. **Order of Operations**:
           - The order in which buttons are applied might not be optimal. We should consider applying black buttons first if they can immediately reduce the uncompleted tasks more effectively.

        3. **Edge Cases**:
           - The solution might not handle edge cases where no buttons can be used on a particular day.

        ### Revised Approach

        1. **Iterate Over Days**:
           - For each day, try to use as many white buttons as possible to reduce planned tasks.
           - Then, try to use as many black buttons as possible to increase completed tasks.

        2. **Button Application**:
           - Use a greedy approach to apply buttons, ensuring that each button is used optimally across all days.

        3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**:
           - Ensure that the logic for checking button applicability is correctly implemented.

        Let's revise the code with these considerations in mind.

        ```python
        def minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
            results = []

                D.sort()

        - **Iterative Button Application**: The code now uses a `while` loop to apply as many buttons as possible for each day, ensuring that the constraints are respected.
        - **Button Removal**: Once a button is used, it is removed from the list to prevent reuse.
        - **Order of Operations**: The order of applying white and black buttons is maintained, but the logic ensures that each button is used optimally.

        This solution should correctly minimize the uncompleted tasks by using the buttons in the most effective way possible.

    [Task]:
        Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
        The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
        The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
        Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
        Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
        Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
        Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
        - The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
        - The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
        - The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
        - The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

        -----Output-----
        - In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
        - 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
        - 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
        - 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

        -----Subtasks-----
        - Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
        - Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        1
        4 2 2 
        5 7 6 1
        3 3 1 1
        6 3
        1 4

        Output:
        3

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1.
        In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
        Use black button 1 on the first day.
        Use black button 4 on the second day.
        Use white button 3 on the third day.
        The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
        5 7 3 1
        4 7 1 1
        So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong.

        ### Problem Analysis

        1. **Objective**: Minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.
        2. **Constraints**:
           - White buttons can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.
           - Black buttons can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.

        ### Solution Analysis

        1. **Sorting**:
           - White buttons are sorted in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks.
           - Black buttons are sorted in ascending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.

        2. **Button Application**:
           - For each day, attempt to use the largest possible white button first.
           - Then, attempt to use the smallest possible black button.

        ### Potential Issues

        1. **Button Usage**:
           - The current approach uses each button only once per day, but it might be more optimal to use multiple buttons on a single day if possible.
           - The logic for applying buttons might not be correctly implemented, especially in terms of when to stop using buttons.

        2. **Order of Operations**:
           - The order in which buttons are applied might not be optimal. We should consider applying black buttons first if they can immediately reduce the uncompleted tasks more effectively.

        3. **Edge Cases**:
           - The solution might not handle edge cases where no buttons can be used on a particular day.

        ### Revised Approach

        1. **Iterate Over Days**:
           - For each day, try to use as many white buttons as possible to reduce planned tasks.
           - Then, try to use as many black buttons as possible to increase completed tasks.

        2. **Button Application**:
           - Use a greedy approach to apply buttons, ensuring that each button is used optimally across all days.

        3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**:
           - Ensure that the logic for checking button applicability is correctly implemented.

        Let's revise the code with these considerations in mind.

        ```python
        def minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
            results = []

                A = test_case['A']
                B = test_case['B']
                C = test_case['C']
                D = test_case['D']

                C.sort(reverse=True)
                # Sort black buttons in ascending order
                D.sort()
        
                # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks

                            A[i] -= C[j]
                            C.pop(j)
                        else:
                            j += 1

                    j = 0
                    while j < len(D):
                        if B[i] + D[j] <= A[i]:
                            B[i] += D[j]
                            D.pop(j)
                        else:
                            j += 1
        
                # Calculate total uncompleted tasks
                total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))
                results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        def main():
            import sys

            data = input().split()

                D = list(map(int, data[index:index+M]))
                index += M

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()

        This revised solution attempts to use as many buttons as possible on each day, ensuring that the constraints are respected. The logic for applying buttons has been adjusted to allow multiple button uses per day.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   You start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.
   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k - 1` additional sticks.
   - You need `k` coals, which requires `k * y` sticks (since each coal requires `y` sticks).
   - Therefore, you need a total of `k * y + k - 1` sticks.
   - Use the first trade to get enough sticks. For each trade, you gain `x - 1` sticks (since you lose 1 stick to gain `x` sticks).
   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required number of sticks.
   - Add the number of trades needed to get `k` coals.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   For each test case:
       Calculate total_sticks_needed = k * y + k - 1
       Calculate trades_for_sticks = ceil((total_sticks_needed) / (x - 1))
       Calculate total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k
       Output total_trades
   ```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft `k` torches, given specific trading rules for sticks and coal. The core concept was to efficiently manage resources (sticks) through trading to meet the requirements for crafting torches.

The key insight was to calculate the total number of sticks needed, which is `k * y + k - 1`, where `k * y` sticks are needed for coal and `k - 1` additional sticks are needed to reach `k` sticks from the initial 1 stick. The challenge was to determine how many trades are required to accumulate these sticks using the first trade option, which gives `x - 1` additional sticks per trade.

The solution involved calculating the number of trades needed to gather the required sticks using integer division and ceiling logic, and then adding the number of trades needed to acquire `k` coals. The formula `(total_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)` was used to effectively compute the ceiling of the division without using floating-point operations, which is crucial for handling large numbers efficiently.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding resource management and trade-offs in algorithmic problems, as well as the utility of integer arithmetic for efficient computation. The solution was implemented successfully and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

   - The problem required understanding how to maximize stick acquisition through trades and then using those sticks to acquire coal. This involved calculating the total number of sticks needed and then determining how many trades would be necessary to achieve that number.

2. **Mathematical Calculation:**
   - The core of the solution was the formula to calculate the number of trades needed to gather enough sticks. This was done using integer division to determine how many times we need to perform the stick trade to reach the required number of sticks.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - Both my solution and the official solution efficiently handle the constraints, using simple arithmetic operations and integer division to compute the result in constant time for each test case.

The official solution is concise and uses a direct approach to solve the problem, which is a good reminder of the power of mathematical reasoning in algorithmic problem-solving. The use of integer division to calculate the number of trades is a particularly useful technique for similar problems involving resource accumulation and trade-offs.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft `k` torches, given specific trading rules for sticks and coal. The core concept was to efficiently manage resources (sticks) through trading to meet the requirements for crafting torches.

The main function is `minimum_trades`.
INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] The function calculates the minimum number of trades required for each test case to obtain a specified number of sticks and coals. For each test case, it computes the total number of sticks needed by multiplying the number of coals by the number of sticks per coal and adding the number of coals minus one. It then determines the number of trades required to acquire the necessary sticks, considering that each trade provides a certain number of additional sticks. The total number of trades is the sum of trades needed for sticks and the number of coals. The function stores the result for each test case and prints the results sequentially.

[Problem]
    You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

    Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

    During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

    Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

    You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


    -----Input-----

    The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

    The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.
