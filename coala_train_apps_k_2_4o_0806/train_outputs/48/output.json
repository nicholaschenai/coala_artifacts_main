    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   You start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.\n   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k - 1` additional sticks.\n   - You need `k` coals, which requires `k * y` sticks (since each coal requires `y` sticks).\n   - Therefore, you need a total of `k * y + k - 1` sticks.\n   - Use the first trade to get enough sticks. For each trade, you gain `x - 1` sticks (since you lose 1 stick to gain `x` sticks).\n   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required number of sticks.\n   - Add the number of trades needed to get `k` coals.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   For each test case:\n       Calculate total_sticks_needed = k * y + k - 1\n       Calculate trades_for_sticks = ceil((total_sticks_needed) / (x - 1))\n       Calculate total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n       Output total_trades\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for x, y, k in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the total number of sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k * y + k - 1\n        \n        # Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks\n        # Each trade gives us (x - 1) additional sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)\n        \n        # Total trades include trades for sticks and trades for coals\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(total_trades)\n    \n    # Output all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Number of test cases\nt = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\n\n# Read each test case\nfor _ in range(t):\n    x = int(data[index])\n    y = int(data[index + 1])\n    k = int(data[index + 2])\n    test_cases.append((x, y, k))\n    index += 3\n\n# Call the function\nminimum_trades(t, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case to calculate the minimum number of trades needed, and outputs the result for each test case.",
