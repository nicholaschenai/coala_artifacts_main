    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of several rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to determine the winner based on the maximum lead a player had at the end of any round. The lead is calculated as the difference between the cumulative scores of the two players at the end of each round. The player with the highest lead at any point in the game is the winner, and we need to output the winner and the maximum lead.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.\n   - Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the player who had that lead.\n   - For each round, update the cumulative scores of both players.\n   - Calculate the lead for the current round.\n   - If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded, update the maximum lead and the player who has this lead.\n   - After processing all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize player1_cumulative_score = 0\n   Initialize player2_cumulative_score = 0\n   Initialize max_lead = 0\n   Initialize winner = 0\n\n   For each round:\n       Read scores for player1 and player2\n       Update player1_cumulative_score and player2_cumulative_score\n       Calculate current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)\n       Determine current_leader based on which player has the higher cumulative score\n       If current_lead > max_lead:\n           Update max_lead to current_lead\n           Update winner to current_leader\n\n   Output winner and max_lead\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_winner_and_lead():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read the number of rounds\n    N = int(data[0])\n    \n    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables\n    player1_cumulative_score = 0\n    player2_cumulative_score = 0\n    max_lead = 0\n    winner = 0\n    \n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(N):\n        # Read scores for the current round\n        Si = int(data[index])\n        Ti = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        # Update cumulative scores\n        player1_cumulative_score += Si\n        player2_cumulative_score += Ti\n        \n        # Calculate the current lead\n        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:\n            current_lead = player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score\n            current_leader = 1\n        else:\n            current_lead = player2_cumulative_score - player1_cumulative_score\n            current_leader = 2\n        \n        # Update max lead and winner if current lead is greater\n        if current_lead > max_lead:\n            max_lead = current_lead\n            winner = current_leader\n    \n    # Output the winner and the maximum lead\n    print(winner, max_lead)\n\n```",
