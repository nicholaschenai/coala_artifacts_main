## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of multiple rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to determine the winner based on a special rule: after each round, we calculate the cumulative scores of both players and determine the leader and the lead (the difference between the leader's score and the other player's score). The winner is the player who had the maximum lead at the end of any round. We need to output the winner and the maximum lead.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing cumulative scores for both players and variables to track the maximum lead and the winner.
2. **Iterate Through Rounds**: For each round, update the cumulative scores for both players.
3. **Calculate Lead**: Determine the current lead and the leader after each round.
4. **Update Maximum Lead**: If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded so far, update the maximum lead and record the current leader as the winner.
5. **Output the Result**: After processing all rounds, output the winner and the maximum lead.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_winner_and_lead(N, scores):
    initialize player1_cumulative_score to 0
    initialize player2_cumulative_score to 0
    initialize max_lead to 0
    initialize winner to 0

    for each round in scores:
        update player1_cumulative_score with player1's score for the round
        update player2_cumulative_score with player2's score for the round

        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
            current_lead = player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 1
        else:
            current_lead = player2_cumulative_score - player1_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 2

        if current_lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = current_lead
            winner = current_leader

    return winner, max_lead
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_winner_and_lead(N, scores):
    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables
    player1_cumulative_score = 0
    player2_cumulative_score = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0

    # Iterate through each round
    for score in scores:
        # Update cumulative scores
        player1_cumulative_score += score[0]
        player2_cumulative_score += score[1]

        # Determine current lead and leader
        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
            current_lead = player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 1
        else:
            current_lead = player2_cumulative_score - player1_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 2

        # Update maximum lead and winner if current lead is greater
        if current_lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = current_lead
            winner = current_leader

    # Output the winner and the maximum lead
    print(winner, max_lead)

# Example usage:
# N = 5
# scores = [(140, 82), (89, 134), (90, 110), (112, 106), (88, 90)]
# find_winner_and_lead(N, scores)
```

This code reads the number of rounds and the scores for each round, calculates the cumulative scores, determines the leader and lead after each round, and finally outputs the winner and the maximum lead.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.

        Congratulations !!! You have successfully completed the heist by looting all the gifts in Santa's locker. Now it's time to decide who gets to take all the gifts, you or the Grinch, there will be no splitting. So you and Grinch decide to play a game.
        To start the game, an Integer N will be given. The game is played in turns and for each turn, the player can make any one of the following moves:
        - Divide N by any of it's odd divisors greater than 1.
        - Subtract 1 from N if N is greater than 1.
        Divisor of a number includes the number itself.
        The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.
        Since you are the mastermind of the heist, you get to play the first move.

        -----Input-----
        The first line contains a single integer T (1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
        The only line of each test case contains a single integer â€” N (1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 109).

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `determine_winner()` was defined but never called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the function should be called to execute the logic and produce the output.

        ### Steps to Correct the Code

        1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the function `determine_winner()` is called after its definition to execute the logic.
        2. **Standard Input/Output**: The function should read from standard input and write to standard output, which is already correctly implemented using `sys.stdin.read()` and `print()`.

        ### Corrected Solution

        The only change needed is to call the `determine_winner()` function after its definition. Here is the corrected code:

        ```python
        def determine_winner():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                if N % 2 == 1:
                    results.append("Me")
                else:
                    results.append("Grinch")
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the function to execute the logic
        determine_winner()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Function Call**: The function `determine_winner()` is now called at the end of the script, ensuring that the logic is executed and the results are printed.
        - **Input Handling**: The function reads all input at once and processes each test case, determining the winner based on whether \( N \) is odd or even.
        - **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed line by line, matching the expected output format.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called to execute the logic. Here is the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def determine_winner():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                if N % 2 == 1:
                    results.append("Me")
                else:
                    results.append("Grinch")
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the function to execute the logic
        determine_winner()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Function Call**: The function `determine_winner()` is now called at the end of the script, ensuring that the logic is executed and the results are printed.
        - **Input Handling**: The function reads all input at once and processes each test case, determining the winner based on whether \( N \) is odd or even.

   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of several rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to determine the winner based on the maximum lead a player had at the end of any round. The lead is calculated as the difference between the cumulative scores of the two players at the end of each round. The player with the highest lead at any point in the game is the winner, and we need to output the winner and the maximum lead.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of several rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to determine the winner based on the maximum lead a player had at the end of any round. The lead is calculated as the difference between the cumulative scores of the two players at the end of each round. The player with the highest lead at any point in the game is the winner, and we need to output the winner and the maximum lead.

   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the player who had that lead.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores of both players.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round.
   - If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded, update the maximum lead and the player who has this lead.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90

Output:
1 58

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to read input from standard input, which includes the number of rounds and the scores for each round.
   - We need to calculate cumulative scores for both players after each round.
   - We need to determine the lead after each round and track the maximum lead and the player who had that lead.
   - Finally, we need to output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

2. **Where the Code Might Be Wrong:**
   - The function `find_winner_and_lead()` is defined but not called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed.
   - The input reading mechanism using `sys.stdin.read()` is correct, but since the function is not called, the input is not processed.

3. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure that the function `find_winner_and_lead()` is called so that the input is processed and the output is generated.
   - Verify that the input is read correctly and the logic for calculating the cumulative scores and determining the maximum lead is correct.

Let's fix the code by calling the function:

```python
def find_winner_and_lead():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read the number of rounds
    N = int(data[0])
    
    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables
    player1_cumulative_score = 0
    player2_cumulative_score = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0
    
    index = 1
    for _ in range(N):
        # Read scores for the current round
        Si = int(data[index])
        Ti = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Update cumulative scores
        player1_cumulative_score += Si
        player2_cumulative_score += Ti
        
        # Calculate the current lead
        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
            current_lead = player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 1
        else:
            current_lead = player2_cumulative_score - player1_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 2
        
        # Update max lead and winner if current lead is greater
        if current_lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = current_lead
            winner = current_leader
    
    # Output the winner and the maximum lead
    print(winner, max_lead)

# Call the function to execute the logic
find_winner_and_lead()
```

By calling the function `find_winner_and_lead()`, the input will be processed, and the output will be generated as expected.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90

Output:
1 58

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of several rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to determine the winner based on the maximum lead a player had at the end of any round. The lead is calculated as the difference between the cumulative scores of the two players at the end of each round. The player with the highest lead at any point in the game is the winner, and we need to output the winner and the maximum lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the player who had that lead.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores of both players.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round.
   - If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded, update the maximum lead and the player who has this lead.
   - After processing all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize player1_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize player2_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize max_lead = 0
   Initialize winner = 0

   For each round:
       Read scores for player1 and player2
       Update player1_cumulative_score and player2_cumulative_score
       Calculate current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
       Determine current_leader based on which player has the higher cumulative score
       If current_lead > max_lead:
           Update max_lead to current_lead
           Update winner to current_leader

   Output winner and max_lead
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to read input from standard input, which includes the number of rounds and the scores for each round.
   - We need to calculate cumulative scores for both players after each round.
   - We need to determine the lead after each round and track the maximum lead and the player who had that lead.
   - Finally, we need to output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

2. **Where the Code Might Be Wrong:**
   - The function `find_winner_and_lead()` is defined but not called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed.
   - The input reading mechanism using `sys.stdin.read()` is correct, but since the function is not called, the input is not processed.

3. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure that the function `find_winner_and_lead()` is called so that the input is processed and the output is generated.
   - Verify that the input is read correctly and the logic for calculating the cumulative scores and determining the maximum lead is correct.

Let's fix the code by calling the function:

```python
def find_winner_and_lead():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read the number of rounds
    N = int(data[0])
    
    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables
    player1_cumulative_score = 0
    player2_cumulative_score = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0
    
    index = 1
    for _ in range(N):
        # Read scores for the current round
        Si = int(data[index])
        Ti = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Update cumulative scores
        player1_cumulative_score += Si
        player2_cumulative_score += Ti
        
        # Calculate the current lead
        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
            current_lead = player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 1
        else:
            current_lead = player2_cumulative_score - player1_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 2
        
        # Update max lead and winner if current lead is greater
        if current_lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = current_lead
            winner = current_leader
    
    # Output the winner and the maximum lead
    print(winner, max_lead)

# Call the function to execute the logic
find_winner_and_lead()
```

By calling the function `find_winner_and_lead()`, the input will be processed, and the output will be generated as expected.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the winner of a game based on the parity (odd or even nature) of a number \( N \). The game rules allowed dividing \( N \) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1 or subtracting 1 from \( N \). The key insight was recognizing that if \( N \) is odd, the first player (me) can always win by making it even for the opponent, who will eventually lose. Conversely, if \( N \) is even, the opponent can make it odd, leading to my loss.

    Initially, the solution logic was correct, but the function was not called, leading to no output. This was a simple oversight that was fixed by ensuring the function `determine_winner()` was called after its definition. This experience reinforced the importance of verifying that all parts of a script, especially function calls, are correctly implemented to ensure the program executes as intended.

    The final solution involved reading input, determining the parity of \( N \) for each test case, and printing "Me" if \( N \) was odd and "Grinch" if even. This approach efficiently solved the problem by leveraging the properties of odd and even numbers in the context of the game's rules.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
      \[
      S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
      \]
      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

    ### Strategy:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_nth_term(N):
        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_nth_term(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of several rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to determine the winner based on the maximum lead a player had at the end of any round. The lead is calculated as the difference between the cumulative scores of the two players at the end of each round. The player with the highest lead at any point in the game is the winner, and we need to output the winner and the maximum lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the player who had that lead.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores of both players.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round.
   - If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded, update the maximum lead and the player who has this lead.
   - After processing all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize player1_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize player2_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize max_lead = 0
   Initialize winner = 0

   For each round:
       Read scores for player1 and player2
       Update player1_cumulative_score and player2_cumulative_score
       Calculate current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
       Determine current_leader based on which player has the higher cumulative score
       If current_lead > max_lead:
           Update max_lead to current_lead
           Update winner to current_leader

   Output winner and max_lead
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to read input from standard input, which includes the number of rounds and the scores for each round.
   - We need to calculate cumulative scores for both players after each round.
   - We need to determine the lead after each round and track the maximum lead and the player who had that lead.
   - Finally, we need to output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

2. **Where the Code Might Be Wrong:**
   - The function `find_winner_and_lead()` is defined but not called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed.
   - The input reading mechanism using `sys.stdin.read()` is correct, but since the function is not called, the input is not processed.

3. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure that the function `find_winner_and_lead()` is called so that the input is processed and the output is generated.
   - Verify that the input is read correctly and the logic for calculating the cumulative scores and determining the maximum lead is correct.

Let's fix the code by calling the function:

```python
def find_winner_and_lead():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read the number of rounds
    N = int(data[0])
    
    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables
    player1_cumulative_score = 0
    player2_cumulative_score = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0
    
    index = 1
    for _ in range(N):
        # Read scores for the current round
        Si = int(data[index])
        Ti = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Update cumulative scores
        player1_cumulative_score += Si
        player2_cumulative_score += Ti
        
        # Calculate the current lead
        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
            current_lead = player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 1
        else:
            current_lead = player2_cumulative_score - player1_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 2
        
        # Update max lead and winner if current lead is greater
        if current_lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = current_lead
            winner = current_leader
    
    # Output the winner and the maximum lead
    print(winner, max_lead)

# Call the function to execute the logic
find_winner_and_lead()
```

By calling the function `find_winner_and_lead()`, the input will be processed, and the output will be generated as expected.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead a player had at any point during the game. The core concept involved calculating cumulative scores for two players over multiple rounds and tracking the maximum lead and the player who achieved it.

Initially, the solution involved defining a function to encapsulate the logic, but the function was not called, leading to no output. This highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed, especially when dealing with input/output operations in competitive programming or script-based environments.

The successful strategy involved:
- Reading input using `sys.stdin.read()` to handle multiple lines of input efficiently.
- Iterating over each round to update cumulative scores and calculate the lead.
- Tracking the maximum lead and the player who achieved it.
- Ensuring the function was called to process the input and produce the output.

This experience reinforced the importance of verifying that all parts of a solution, especially function calls, are correctly implemented to ensure the program executes as intended.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90

Output:
1 58

   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of several rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to determine the winner based on the maximum lead a player had at the end of any round. The lead is calculated as the difference between the cumulative scores of the two players at the end of each round. The player with the highest lead at any point in the game is the winner, and we need to output the winner and the maximum lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the player who had that lead.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores of both players.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round.
   - If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded, update the maximum lead and the player who has this lead.
   - After processing all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize player1_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize player2_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize max_lead = 0
   Initialize winner = 0

   For each round:
       Read scores for player1 and player2
       Update player1_cumulative_score and player2_cumulative_score
       Calculate current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
       Determine current_leader based on which player has the higher cumulative score
       If current_lead > max_lead:

    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

mlead1=mlead2=0
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, y= list(map(int, input().split()))
    s1, s2= s1+x, s2+y
    if(s1>s2):
        lead=(s1-s2)
        mlead1= max(mlead1, lead)
    else:
        lead=(s2-s1)
        mlead2= max(mlead2, lead)
if(mlead1<(mlead2)):
    print('2', mlead2)
else:
    print('1', mlead1)



INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Function Call Omission:**
   - Initially, my solution failed because I defined a function but forgot to call it. This is a common oversight when structuring code into functions, especially in competitive programming or environments where the main logic is expected to be executed immediately.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - Both my solution and the official solution correctly handle input using `sys.stdin.read()` and `input()`, respectively. The choice between these methods depends on the environment and the expected input format.

3. **Cumulative Score Calculation:**
   - Both solutions maintain cumulative scores for each player and calculate the lead after each round. This is a straightforward approach to track the game's progress and determine the maximum lead.

4. **Tracking Maximum Lead:**
   - The official solution uses two separate variables (`mlead1` and `mlead2`) to track the maximum lead for each player, which simplifies the final decision on the winner. My solution used a single `max_lead` variable and a `winner` variable, which also works but requires additional logic to determine the winner.

5. **Efficiency and Clarity:**
   - The official solution is concise and efficient, using a single loop to process input and determine the result. It effectively uses Python's built-in functions like `max()` to simplify the logic.

In summary, the official solution is a clean and efficient implementation of the problem requirements. It highlights the importance of simplicity and clarity in code, especially when dealing with straightforward logic like cumulative score tracking and lead calculation. This experience reinforces the need to ensure all parts of the code are executed, especially in environments where function calls are not automatically handled.

[Problem]
    The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
    on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
    purposes this is sufficient.
    The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
    obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
    have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
    adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
    total score is declared the winner.
    The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
    the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
    of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
    changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
    end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
    all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
    end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

    Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
    RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

    The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
    each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
    Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
    The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
    at the end of round 1) during the game.
    Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
    lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
    always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
    Input
    The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
    â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
    2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
    Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
    and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
    1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
    Output
    Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
    W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
    maximum lead attained by the winner.
    Example
    Input:
    5
    140 82
    89 134
    90 110
    112 106
    88 90
