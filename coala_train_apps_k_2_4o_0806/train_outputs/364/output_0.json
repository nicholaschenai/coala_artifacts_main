    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have two jugs with capacities `x` and `y` liters. We need to determine if it's possible to measure exactly `z` liters using these two jugs. We can fill a jug, empty a jug, or pour water from one jug to another until one is full or the other is empty.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The problem is a classic example of the water jug problem, which can be solved using the mathematical concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The key insight is that we can measure exactly `z` liters if and only if `z` is a multiple of the GCD of `x` and `y`, and `z` is less than or equal to the sum of `x` and `y`. This is because any measurable amount of water using the two jugs must be a linear combination of `x` and `y`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function gcd(a, b) to compute the greatest common divisor of a and b.\n   \n   Define the main function canMeasureWater(x, y, z):\n       If z is 0, return True (since we can measure 0 liters by doing nothing).\n       If z is greater than x + y, return False (since we can't measure more than the total capacity).\n       Compute the GCD of x and y.\n       If z is a multiple of the GCD, return True.\n       Otherwise, return False.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    # Helper function to compute the greatest common divisor\n    def gcd(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    # Main function to determine if we can measure exactly z liters\n    def canMeasureWater(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> bool:\n        # If z is 0, we can measure it by doing nothing\n        if z == 0:\n            return True\n        # If z is greater than the total capacity of both jugs, it's impossible\n        if z > x + y:\n            return False\n        # Calculate the greatest common divisor of x and y\n        gcd_value = self.gcd(x, y)\n        # We can measure z if and only if z is a multiple of the gcd of x and y\n        return z % gcd_value == 0\n```\n\nThis solution uses the GCD to determine if the desired amount of water can be measured, leveraging the properties of linear combinations and the constraints of the problem.",
