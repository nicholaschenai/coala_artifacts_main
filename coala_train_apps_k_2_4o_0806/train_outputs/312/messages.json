If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of potential starting points of subarrays. The idea is to maintain a prefix sum array and use it to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray. The deque will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the array from the start up to index `i-1`.\n2. **Deque for Indices**: Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sum array. This will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray.\n3. **Iterate Over Prefix Sum**: For each element in the prefix sum array:\n   - Check if the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the index stored at the front of the deque is at least `K`. If it is, update the minimum length and remove the index from the deque.\n   - Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums by removing indices from the back if the current prefix sum is less than or equal to the prefix sum at those indices.\n   - Add the current index to the deque.\n4. **Return Result**: If a valid subarray is found, return its length; otherwise, return `-1`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction shortestSubarray(A, K):\n    n = length of A\n    prefix_sum = array of size n+1 initialized to 0\n    for i from 0 to n:\n        prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n    \n    deque = empty deque\n    min_length = infinity\n    \n    for i from 0 to n:\n        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= K:\n            min_length = min(min_length, i - deque[0])\n            remove front element from deque\n        \n        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]]:\n            remove back element from deque\n        \n        add i to deque\n    \n    if min_length is infinity:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return min_length\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubarray(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:\n        n = len(A)\n        # Step 1: Compute the prefix sum array\n        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n        \n        # Step 2: Initialize a deque to store indices and a variable for the minimum length\n        dq = deque()\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        \n        # Step 3: Iterate over the prefix sum array\n        for i in range(n + 1):\n            # Check if we can form a valid subarray with sum at least K\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:\n                min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())\n            \n            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:\n                dq.pop()\n            \n            # Add the current index to the deque\n            dq.append(i)\n        \n        # Step 4: Return the result\n        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K` using a combination of prefix sums and a deque to maintain potential starting indices. The time complexity is O(n) due to the linear traversal and deque operations."

The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.\n\n    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.\n\n    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.\n\n    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n        \n            sum_A = sum(A)\n            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                k = sum_A // sum_indices\n                possible = True\n                for i in range(N):\n                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                if possible:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem revolves around finding a contiguous subarray with a sum closest to zero. This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using prefix sums and sorting. The key idea is to leverage the prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray and then find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray with the sum closest to zero.\n\n    #### Strategies and Challenges\n    Initially, the approach involved calculating prefix sums and using a dictionary to track their indices. The idea was to find the smallest absolute difference between any two prefix sums. However, the solution failed to correctly output the actual subarray sum (which can be negative) and instead outputted its absolute value. This was a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.\n\n    The correct strategy involved sorting the prefix sums along with their indices and iterating over them to find the smallest difference. The challenge was ensuring that the actual subarray sum was outputted, not its absolute value.\n\n    #### Fixing Errors\n    The main error was in the output of the subarray sum. The solution was adjusted to track the actual subarray sum and ensure it was printed correctly. Sorting the prefix sums allowed for an efficient comparison of consecutive sums to find the minimum difference.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n    The final solution involves:\n    1. Calculating prefix sums.\n    2. Sorting the prefix sums with their indices.\n    3. Iterating over sorted prefix sums to find the smallest difference.\n    4. Outputting the actual subarray sum and the correct segment indices.\n\n    This approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct, handling large inputs within the constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This approach is optimal for handling large input sizes due to its linear time complexity.\n\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**\n   The use of prefix sums is crucial in this problem as it allows us to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray by subtracting two prefix sums. This reduces the need for nested loops and makes the solution efficient.\n\n3. **Deque Maintenance:**\n   The official solution and my solution both maintain the deque in a way that ensures the prefix sums are in increasing order. This is important because it allows us to efficiently find the shortest subarray by removing indices from the deque that cannot contribute to a shorter subarray.\n\n4. **Handling Negative Numbers:**\n   The official solution explicitly handles negative numbers by removing any greater cumulative sums from the end of the deque. This ensures that the deque only contains potential starting points for subarrays that could lead to a valid solution.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   Both solutions handle edge cases where no valid subarray exists by returning `-1`. This is done by checking if the minimum length found is still greater than the length of the array.\n\nOverall, the official solution is quite similar to my approach, with slight differences in implementation details.
