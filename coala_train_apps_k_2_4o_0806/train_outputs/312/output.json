    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given list of integers `A` such that the sum of the subarray is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to maintain potential starting points of subarrays. We will use a prefix sum array to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements up to each index. The idea is to iterate through the array while maintaining a deque of indices that represent potential starting points of subarrays. For each index, we will check if the difference between the current prefix sum and the prefix sum at the front of the deque is at least `K`. If it is, we update the minimum length of the subarray. We will also ensure that the deque is maintained in a way that the prefix sums are in increasing order, which helps in efficiently finding the shortest subarray.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a deque to store indices\n   Initialize a variable min_length to infinity\n   Initialize a prefix_sum array with an initial value of 0\n\n   For each index i from 0 to length of A:\n       Update prefix_sum[i+1] as prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n\n       While deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i+1] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= K:\n           Update min_length as the minimum of min_length and i - deque[0]\n           Remove the front element from the deque\n\n       While deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i+1] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]]:\n           Remove the last element from the deque\n\n       Add index i to the deque\n\n   If min_length is still infinity, return -1\n   Otherwise, return min_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubarray(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize a deque to store indices\n        deq = deque()\n        # Initialize min_length to a large number\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        # Initialize prefix_sum array with an initial value of 0\n        prefix_sum = [0] * (len(A) + 1)\n        \n        # Calculate prefix sums\n        for i in range(len(A)):\n            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n        \n        # Iterate over each index\n        for i in range(len(prefix_sum)):\n            # Check if we can form a valid subarray\n            while deq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[deq[0]] >= K:\n                min_length = min(min_length, i - deq.popleft())\n            \n            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums\n            while deq and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[deq[-1]]:\n                deq.pop()\n            \n            # Add the current index to the deque\n            deq.append(i)\n        \n        # If min_length is still infinity, no valid subarray was found\n        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the shortest subarray with a sum of at least `K` using a sliding window approach with a deque, ensuring optimal performance for large input sizes.",
