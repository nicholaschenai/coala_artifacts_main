    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum of at least `K`. The challenge was to do this efficiently given the constraints, where the length of the array could be up to 50,000.\n\nThe core concept used here was the sliding window technique combined with a deque to efficiently manage potential starting points of subarrays. The prefix sum array was crucial for quickly calculating the sum of any subarray. By maintaining a deque of indices where the prefix sums are in increasing order, we could efficiently determine the shortest subarray that meets the condition.\n\nThe strategy that worked involved iterating through the array while updating the prefix sum and using the deque to track indices. For each index, we checked if the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the front of the deque was at least `K`, which indicated a valid subarray. We then updated the minimum length accordingly. The deque was maintained to ensure that it only contained indices with increasing prefix sums, which allowed us to efficiently find the shortest subarray.\n\nThis approach was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining prefix sums with a deque for problems involving subarray sums. This pattern is useful for similar problems where we need to find subarrays with specific sum properties.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:\n\n1. **Sliding Window with Deque:**\n   Both my solution and the official solution utilize a sliding window approach with a deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum of at least `K`. This approach is optimal for handling large input sizes due to its linear time complexity.\n\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**\n   The use of prefix sums is crucial in this problem as it allows us to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray by subtracting two prefix sums. This reduces the need for nested loops and makes the solution efficient.\n\n3. **Deque Maintenance:**\n   The official solution and my solution both maintain the deque in a way that ensures the prefix sums are in increasing order. This is important because it allows us to efficiently find the shortest subarray by removing indices from the deque that cannot contribute to a shorter subarray.\n\n4. **Handling Negative Numbers:**\n   The official solution explicitly handles negative numbers by removing any greater cumulative sums from the end of the deque. This ensures that the deque only contains potential starting points for subarrays that could lead to a valid solution.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   Both solutions handle edge cases where no valid subarray exists by returning `-1`. This is done by checking if the minimum length found is still greater than the length of the array.\n\nOverall, the official solution is quite similar to my approach, with slight differences in implementation details. The key takeaway is the effective use of prefix sums and a deque to maintain potential starting points for subarrays, which allows for an efficient solution to the problem.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThe function finds the length of the shortest contiguous subarray whose sum is at least a given integer \\( K \\). It uses a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate subarray sums and a deque to maintain indices of the prefix sums in increasing order. As it iterates through the prefix sums, it checks if the current subarray sum (from the deque's front to the current index) meets or exceeds \\( K \\), updating the minimum length if it does. The deque is adjusted to ensure it only contains indices that could potentially form a valid subarray in the future. If no such subarray is found, the function returns -1; otherwise, it returns the length of the shortest subarray found.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to find the shortest subarray with a sum constraint, which is a common problem in competitive programming and algorithm design. It is particularly relevant when dealing with large arrays where a brute force approach would be inefficient. The solution uses a sliding window technique with a deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray, which is a pattern that can be applied to other problems involving subarrays and prefix sums. This approach is also useful in financial analysis, signal processing, or any field where you need to analyze contiguous segments of data for specific properties."
