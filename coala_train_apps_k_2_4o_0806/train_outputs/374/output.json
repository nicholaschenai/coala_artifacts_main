    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given an array of strings, and we need to find the smallest string that contains each string in the array as a substring. No string in the array is a substring of another string in the array. The task is to find any valid smallest superstring.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively merge strings by maximizing the overlap between them until we form a single superstring. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate Overlaps**: For each pair of strings, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of another.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring. We can use a bitmask to represent the set of strings included in the current superstring and a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each combination of strings.\n\n3. **Reconstruct the Superstring**: Once the DP table is filled, backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. **Initialize Overlap Table**: Create a table `overlap[i][j]` to store the maximum overlap between strings `A[i]` and `A[j]`.\n\n2. **Fill Overlap Table**: For each pair of strings `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum overlap by checking suffixes of `A[i]` and prefixes of `A[j]`.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Create a DP table `dp[mask][i]` where `mask` is a bitmask representing the set of strings included, and `i` is the last string in the superstring. Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` with `A[i]`.\n\n4. **Fill DP Table**: For each `mask` and each `i`, update `dp[mask][i]` by considering adding a new string `j` to the superstring and using the overlap information.\n\n5. **Reconstruct the Superstring**: Start from the full mask and backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:\n        n = len(A)\n        \n        # Step 1: Calculate the overlap between each pair of strings\n        def calculate_overlap(s1, s2):\n            max_overlap = 0\n            for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n                if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n                    max_overlap = i\n            return max_overlap\n        \n        overlap = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i != j:\n                    overlap[i][j] = calculate_overlap(A[i], A[j])\n        \n        # Step 2: Use dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring\n        dp = [[''] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            dp[1 << i][i] = A[i]\n        \n        for mask in range(1 << n):\n            for i in range(n):\n                if not (mask & (1 << i)):\n                    continue\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if mask & (1 << j):\n                        continue\n                    new_mask = mask | (1 << j)\n                    candidate = dp[mask][i] + A[j][overlap[i][j]:]\n                    if dp[new_mask][j] == '' or len(candidate) < len(dp[new_mask][j]):\n                        dp[new_mask][j] = candidate\n        \n        # Step 3: Find the shortest superstring from the dp table\n        min_superstring = ''\n        full_mask = (1 << n) - 1\n        for i in range(n):\n            if min_superstring == '' or len(dp[full_mask][i]) < len(min_superstring):\n                min_superstring = dp[full_mask][i]\n        \n        return min_superstring\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Overlap Calculation**: We calculate the maximum overlap between each pair of strings to determine how much of one string can be appended to another without repeating characters.\n\n- **Dynamic Programming**: We use a bitmask to represent subsets of strings and a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset ending with a specific string.\n\n- **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we find the shortest superstring by checking all possible endings and reconstructing the path that led to it.",
