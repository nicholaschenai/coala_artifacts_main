INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a list of strings, and we need to find the shortest string that contains each of the given strings as a substring. Importantly, no string in the list is a substring of another string in the list. The order of the strings in the final result does not matter as long as all strings are included as substrings.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Overlap**: For each pair of strings, determine the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of another. This overlap will help in minimizing the length of the final superstring.

2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each string is a node. The edge weight between two nodes (strings) is the overlap length. The goal is to find a path that visits all nodes (strings) and minimizes the total length of the superstring.

3. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking**: Use dynamic programming to explore all possible combinations of strings. Use a bitmask to represent the set of strings included in the current superstring. For each state, keep track of the last string added to the superstring and the current length of the superstring.

4. **Reconstruct the Solution**: Once the optimal path is found using dynamic programming, reconstruct the superstring by backtracking through the states.

## Pseudocode

1. **Calculate Overlaps**:
   - For each pair of strings `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of `A[i]` matches the prefix of `A[j]`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Let `dp[mask][i]` be the minimum length of a superstring that contains the set of strings represented by `mask` and ends with the string `A[i]`.
   - Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` to the length of `A[i]` for each string `i`.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each `mask` and each string `i` in `mask`, try to extend the superstring by adding another string `j` not in `mask`.
   - Update `dp[mask | (1 << j)][j]` using the overlap between `A[i]` and `A[j]`.

4. **Reconstruct the Superstring**:
   - Start from the state with all strings included and backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the reconstructed superstring.

## Final Python Solution

    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:
        n = len(A)

                    new_mask = mask | (1 << j)
                    new_length = dp[mask][i] + len(A[j]) - overlap[i][j]
                    if new_length < dp[new_mask][j]:
                        dp[new_mask][j] = new_length
                        parent[new_mask][j] = i
        
        # Find the minimum length superstring
        min_length = float('inf')
        last = -1
        final_mask = (1 << n) - 1
        for i in range(n):
            if dp[final_mask][i] < min_length:
                min_length = dp[final_mask][i]
                last = i
        
        # Reconstruct the shortest superstring
        mask = final_mask
        order = []
        while last != -1:
            order.append(last)
            next_last = parent[mask][last]
            mask ^= (1 << last)
            last = next_last
        
        order.reverse()
        
        # Build the final superstring
        superstring = A[order[0]]
        for k in range(1, len(order)):
            i, j = order[k-1], order[k]
            superstring += A[j][overlap[i][j]:]
        
        return superstring
```

This solution uses dynamic programming with bitmasking to efficiently find the shortest superstring that contains all the given strings as substrings.

    ### Shortest non-appearing string

    Given a string $S$ and a certain alphabet.
    We have to find a string of smallest length, that doesn't appear in $S$.

    We will apply dynamic programming on the suffix automaton built for the string $S$.

    Let $d[v]$ be the answer for the node $v$, i.e. we already processed part of the substring, are currently in the state $v$, and want to find the smallest number of characters that have to be added to find a non-existent transition.
    Computing $d[v]$ is very simple.
    If there is not transition using at least one character of the alphabet, then $d[v] = 1$.
    Otherwise one character is not enough, and so we need to take the minimum of all answers of all transitions:

    $$d[v] = 1 + \min_{w:(v,w,c) \in SA} d[w].$$

    The answer to the problem will be $d[t_0]$, and the actual string can be restored using the computed array $d[]$.

    ### Longest common substring of two strings

    Given two strings $S$ and $T$.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in $S$ and also in $T$.

    We construct a suffix automaton for the string $S$.

    We will now take the string $T$, and for each prefix look for the longest suffix of this prefix in $S$.
    In other words, for each position in the string $T$, we want to find the longest common substring of $S$ and $T$ ending in that position.

    For this we will use two variables, the **current state** $v$, and the **current length** $l$.
    These two variables will describe the current matching part: its length and the state that corresponds to it.

    Initially $v = t_0$ and $l = 0$, i.e. the match is empty.

    Now let us describe how we can add a character $T[i]$ and recalculate the answer for it.

      - If there is a transition from $v$ with the character $T[i]$, then we simply follow the transition and increase $l$ by one.
      - If there is no such transition, we have to shorten the current matching part, which means that we need to follow the suffix link: $v = link(v)$.
        At the same time, the current length has to be shortened.
        Obviously we need to assign $l = len(v)$, since after passing through the suffix link we end up in state whose corresponding longest string is a substring.
      - If there is still no transition using the required character, we repeat and again go through the suffix link and decrease $l$, until we find a transition or we reach the fictional state $-1$ (which means that the symbol $T[i]$ doesn't appear at all in $S$, so we assign $v = l = 0$).

    The answer to the task will be the maximum of all the values $l$.

    The complexity of this part is $O(length(T))$, since in one move we can either increase $l$ by one, or make several passes through the suffix links, each one ends up reducing the value $l$.

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    string lcs (string S, string T) {
        sa_init();
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++)
            sa_extend(S[i]);
 
        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {
            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st[v].link ;
                l = st[v].len;
            }
            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st [v].next[T[i]];
                l++;
            }
            if (l > best) {
                best = l;
                bestpos = i;
            }
        }
        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);
    } 
    ```

    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings

    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.

    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):

    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \dots + S_k + D_k.$$

    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.

    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.
    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \dots, D_k$.

    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.
    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.
    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.

[Reflection]:
    The problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after smashing them together is essentially a variation of the partition problem. The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
       - Both my solution and the official solution use dynamic programming to solve the problem. The idea is to track possible sums of stone weights that can be achieved by selecting different subsets of stones.

    2. **State Representation:**
       - My approach used a boolean array `dp` to represent possible sums up to half of the total weight. The official solution uses a set `dp` to dynamically store all possible sums that can be achieved as we iterate through the stones.

    3. **Efficiency:**
       - The official solution is more elegant and concise. It uses set operations to update possible sums, which simplifies the code and potentially reduces the space complexity by not limiting the sums to half the total weight initially.

    4. **Final Calculation:**
       - Both solutions ultimately aim to find the sum closest to half of the total weight, as this minimizes the difference between the two groups. The official solution calculates the minimum difference directly using a set comprehension.

    ### Reflection:

    The official solution is insightful in its use of set operations to dynamically track possible sums, which simplifies the implementation. This approach is both elegant and efficient, as it avoids the need for a fixed-size array and leverages Python's set operations for concise updates. This experience highlights the importance of considering different data structures (like sets) for dynamic programming problems, especially when dealing with subset sums or partitioning problems.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given an array of strings, and we need to find the smallest string that contains each string in the array as a substring. No string in the array is a substring of another string in the array. The task is to find any valid smallest superstring.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively merge strings by maximizing the overlap between them until we form a single superstring. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate Overlaps**: For each pair of strings, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of another.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring. We can use a bitmask to represent the set of strings included in the current superstring and a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each combination of strings.

3. **Reconstruct the Superstring**: Once the DP table is filled, backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.

### Pseudocode

1. **Initialize Overlap Table**: Create a table `overlap[i][j]` to store the maximum overlap between strings `A[i]` and `A[j]`.

2. **Fill Overlap Table**: For each pair of strings `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum overlap by checking suffixes of `A[i]` and prefixes of `A[j]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Create a DP table `dp[mask][i]` where `mask` is a bitmask representing the set of strings included, and `i` is the last string in the superstring. Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` with `A[i]`.

4. **Fill DP Table**: For each `mask` and each `i`, update `dp[mask][i]` by considering adding a new string `j` to the superstring and using the overlap information.

5. **Reconstruct the Superstring**: Start from the full mask and backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.

### Final Python Solution

    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:

### Explanation of the Code

- **Overlap Calculation**: We calculate the maximum overlap between each pair of strings to determine how much of one string can be appended to another without repeating characters.

- **Dynamic Programming**: We use a bitmask to represent subsets of strings and a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset ending with a specific string.

- **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we find the shortest superstring by checking all possible endings and reconstructing the path that led to it.

 ### Problem Restatement

We are given an array of strings, and we need to find the smallest string that contains each string in the array as a substring. No string in the array is a substring of another string in the array. The task is to find any valid smallest superstring.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively merge strings by maximizing the overlap between them until we form a single superstring. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate Overlaps**: For each pair of strings, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of another.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring. We can use a bitmask to represent the set of strings included in the current superstring and a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each combination of strings.

3. **Reconstruct the Superstring**: Once the DP table is filled, backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.

### Pseudocode

1. **Initialize Overlap Table**: Create a table `overlap[i][j]` to store the maximum overlap between strings `A[i]` and `A[j]`.

2. **Fill Overlap Table**: For each pair of strings `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum overlap by checking suffixes of `A[i]` and prefixes of `A[j]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Create a DP table `dp[mask][i]` where `mask` is a bitmask representing the set of strings included, and `i` is the last string in the superstring. Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` with `A[i]`.

4. **Fill DP Table**: For each `mask` and each `i`, update `dp[mask][i]` by considering adding a new string `j` to the superstring and using the overlap information.

5. **Reconstruct the Superstring**: Start from the full mask and backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] In tackling the problem of finding the shortest superstring that contains each string in a given list as a substring, I employed a combination of greedy and dynamic programming techniques. The core concept was to maximize the overlap between strings to minimize the length of the resulting superstring. This involved calculating the maximum overlap between every pair of strings and using a dynamic programming approach to build the shortest superstring iteratively.

The strategy involved using a bitmask to represent subsets of strings and a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset ending with a specific string. This allowed for efficient exploration of all possible combinations of string orderings, ensuring that the solution was optimal.

One unexpected challenge was ensuring the correct reconstruction of the superstring from the DP table. The solution required careful management of string overlaps and ensuring that the DP table was updated correctly with the shortest possible superstring at each step.

Overall, this problem reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving combinatorial optimization problems and highlighted the utility of bitmasking for efficiently handling subsets. The approach can be adapted to similar problems where the goal is to combine elements optimally based on some overlap or shared property.

### Explanation of the Code

- **Overlap Calculation**: We calculate the maximum overlap between each pair of strings to determine how much of one string can be appended to another without repeating characters.

- **Dynamic Programming**: We use a bitmask to represent subsets of strings and a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset ending with a specific string.

- **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we find the shortest superstring by checking all possible endings and reconstructing the path that led to it.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] ### Reflection

The official solution to the problem of finding the shortest superstring is insightful and offers a different approach compared to my initial attempt. Here are the key takeaways and insights from the official solution:

1. **Filtering Substrings**: The official solution begins by filtering out any strings that are substrings of others. This is a clever optimization step that reduces the problem size and ensures that we only work with the necessary strings.

2. **Memoization**: The use of a memoization decorator is a smart way to optimize recursive function calls. By caching results of previously computed states, the solution avoids redundant calculations, which is crucial for performance given the exponential nature of the problem.

3. **Merge Function**: The `merge` function is used to concatenate two strings with the maximum possible overlap. This is a key operation in constructing the superstring efficiently.

4. **Recursive Approach with Memoization**: The solution uses a recursive function `find_short` to explore all possible ways to construct the superstring. By using memoization, it efficiently finds the shortest superstring by considering all permutations of the strings.

5. **Tuple Representation**: The use of tuples to represent the current set of strings being considered is a neat way to handle state in the recursive function. It allows for easy manipulation and comparison of different states.

Overall, the official solution is more efficient and elegant, particularly due to its use of memoization and the initial filtering step. It effectively reduces the problem complexity and ensures that the solution is both optimal and performant. This approach is a valuable lesson in leveraging memoization and problem-specific optimizations to tackle complex combinatorial problems.
