Importantly, no string in the list is a substring of another string in the list. The order of the strings in the final result does not matter as long as all strings are included as substrings.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Overlap**: For each pair of strings, determine the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of another. This overlap will help in minimizing the length of the final superstring.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each string is a node. The edge weight between two nodes (strings) is the overlap length. The goal is to find a path that visits all nodes (strings) and minimizes the total length of the superstring.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking**: Use dynamic programming to explore all possible combinations of strings. Use a bitmask to represent the set of strings included in the current superstring. For each state, keep track of the last string added to the superstring and the current length of the superstring.\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Solution**: Once the optimal path is found using dynamic programming, reconstruct the superstring by backtracking through the states.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. **Calculate Overlaps**:\n   - For each pair of strings `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of `A[i]` matches the prefix of `A[j]`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:\n   - Let `dp[mask][i]` be the minimum length of a superstring that contains the set of strings represented by `mask` and ends with the string `A[i]`.\n   - Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` to the length of `A[i]` for each string `i`.\n\n3. **DP Transition**:\n   - For each `mask` and each string `i` in `mask`, try to extend the superstring by adding another string `j` not in `mask`.\n   - Update `dp[mask | (1 << j)][j]` using the overlap between `A[i]` and `A[j]`.\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Superstring**:\n   - Start from the state with all strings included and backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - Return the reconstructed superstring.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:\n        n = len(A)\n        \n        # Calculate the overlap between each pair of strings\n        def calculate_overlap(s1, s2):\n            max_overlap = 0\n            for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n                if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n                    max_overlap = i\n            return max_overlap\n        \n        # Precompute the overlap between each pair of strings\n        overlap = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i != j:\n                    overlap[i][j] = calculate_overlap(A[i], A[j])\n        \n        # dp[mask][i] will store the minimum length of superstring ending with A[i]\n        dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n        parent = [[-1] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n        \n        # Initialize the dp array\n        for i in range(n):\n            dp[1 << i][i] = len(A[i])\n        \n        # Fill the dp table\n        for mask in range(1 << n):\n            for i in range(n):\n                if mask & (1 << i) == 0:\n                    continue\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if mask & (1 << j) != 0:\n                        continue\n                    new_mask = mask | (1 << j)\n                    new_length = dp[mask][i] + len(A[j]) - overlap[i][j]\n                    if new_length < dp[new_mask][j]:\n                        dp[new_mask][j] = new_length\n                        parent[new_mask][j] = i\n        \n        # Find the minimum length superstring\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        last = -1\n        final_mask = (1 << n) - 1\n        for i in range(n):\n            if dp[final_mask][i] < min_length:\n                min_length = dp[final_mask][i]\n                last = i\n        \n        # Reconstruct the shortest superstring\n        mask = final_mask\n        order = []\n        while last != -1:\n            order.append(last)\n            next_last = parent[mask][last]\n            mask ^= (1 << last)\n            last = next_last\n        \n        order.reverse()\n        \n        # Build the final superstring\n        superstring = A[order[0]]\n        for k in range(1, len(order)):\n            i, j = order[k-1], order[k]\n            superstring += A[j][overlap[i][j]:]\n        \n        return superstring\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming with bitmasking to efficiently find the shortest superstring that contains all the given strings as substrings."

i < S.size(); i++)\n            sa_extend(S[i]);\n \n        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {\n            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st[v].link ;\n                l = st[v].len;\n            }\n            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st [v].next[T[i]];\n                l++;\n            }\n            if (l > best) {\n                best = l;\n                bestpos = i;\n            }\n        }\n        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);\n    } \n    ```\n\n    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings\n\n    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.\n    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.\n\n    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):\n\n    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \\dots + S_k + D_k.$$\n\n    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.\n\n    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.\n    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \\dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \\dots, D_k$.\n\n    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.\n    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.\n    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after smashing them together is essentially a variation of the partition problem. The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n\n    1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n       - Both my solution and the official solution use dynamic programming to solve the problem. The idea is to track possible sums of stone weights that can be achieved by selecting different subsets of stones.\n\n    2. **State Representation:**\n       - My approach used a boolean array `dp` to represent possible sums up to half of the total weight. The official solution uses a set `dp` to dynamically store all possible sums that can be achieved as we iterate through the stones.\n\n    3. **Efficiency:**\n       - The official solution is more elegant and concise. It uses set operations to update possible sums, which simplifies the code and potentially reduces the space complexity by not limiting the sums to half the total weight initially.\n\n    4. **Final Calculation:**\n       - Both solutions ultimately aim to find the sum closest to half of the total weight, as this minimizes the difference between the two groups. The official solution calculates the minimum difference directly using a set comprehension.\n\n    ### Reflection:\n\n    The official solution is insightful in its use of set operations to dynamically track possible sums, which simplifies the implementation. This approach is both elegant and efficient, as it avoids the need for a fixed-size array and leverages Python's set operations for concise updates. This experience highlights the importance of considering different data structures (like sets) for dynamic programming problems, especially when dealing with subset sums or partitioning problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

Here are the key takeaways and insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Filtering Substrings**: The official solution begins by filtering out any strings that are substrings of others. This is a clever optimization step that reduces the problem size and ensures that we only work with the necessary strings.\n\n2. **Memoization**: The use of a memoization decorator is a smart way to optimize recursive function calls. By caching results of previously computed states, the solution avoids redundant calculations, which is crucial for performance given the exponential nature of the problem.\n\n3. **Merge Function**: The `merge` function is used to concatenate two strings with the maximum possible overlap. This is a key operation in constructing the superstring efficiently.\n\n4. **Recursive Approach with Memoization**: The solution uses a recursive function `find_short` to explore all possible ways to construct the superstring. By using memoization, it efficiently finds the shortest superstring by considering all permutations of the strings.\n\n5. **Tuple Representation**: The use of tuples to represent the current set of strings being considered is a neat way to handle state in the recursive function. It allows for easy manipulation and comparison of different states.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient and elegant, particularly due to its use of memoization and the initial filtering step. It effectively reduces the problem complexity and ensures that the solution is both optimal and performant. This approach is a valuable lesson in leveraging memoization and problem-specific optimizations to tackle complex combinatorial problems."

It first calculates the maximum overlap between each pair of strings. Then, it uses dynamic programming to build the shortest superstring by considering all possible combinations of strings and their overlaps. The dynamic programming table is updated to store the shortest superstring for each combination of strings represented by a bitmask. Finally, it retrieves the shortest superstring from the table by considering all possible ending strings.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to combine multiple strings into the shortest possible string that contains each of the original strings as a substring. This is particularly relevant in computational biology for DNA sequencing, where you need to assemble short DNA reads into a longer sequence. It is also applicable in data compression, where you want to minimize the length of a string while preserving all necessary substrings. Additionally, this problem is a classic example of the shortest common superstring problem, which is a well-known problem in computer science and can be applied in various fields such as text processing, network routing, and more."
