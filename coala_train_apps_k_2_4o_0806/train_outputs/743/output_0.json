    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nChef has two candidates to distribute apples into boxes. Each candidate can distribute apples in a different way:\n- The first candidate distributes apples evenly, putting one apple in each box at a time.\n- The second candidate puts all apples into the box with the fewest apples.\n\nGiven the number of apples \\( N \\) and the number of boxes \\( K \\), where \\( N \\) is a multiple of \\( K \\), determine if the final distribution of apples can differ based on which candidate is chosen.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Distribution**:\n   - The first candidate will always distribute apples evenly across all boxes. If \\( N \\) apples are distributed into \\( K \\) boxes, each box will have \\( \\frac{N}{K} \\) apples.\n   - The second candidate will place all \\( K \\) apples into one box at a time, potentially leading to a situation where one box has all the apples and others have none.\n\n2. **Condition for Different Distributions**:\n   - If \\( K = N \\), the second candidate will place all apples into one box, while the first candidate will distribute them evenly. This results in different distributions.\n   - If \\( K < N \\), the first candidate will still distribute evenly, but the second candidate will fill one box at a time, leading to a different distribution.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The distributions will be the same only if \\( K = 1 \\) or \\( K = N \\). In these cases, both candidates will end up with the same distribution.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction canDistributionsDiffer(T, test_cases):\n    for each (N, K) in test_cases:\n        if K == 1 or K == N:\n            print \"NO\"\n        else:\n            print \"YES\"\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef canDistributionsDiffer():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        if K == 1 or K == N:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings for easy access.\n- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, we extract \\( N \\) and \\( K \\).\n- **Decision Making**: We check if \\( K \\) is either 1 or equal to \\( N \\). If so, the distributions will be the same, and we print \"NO\". Otherwise, we print \"YES\" indicating the distributions can differ.\n- **Output**: We print the results for each test case.",
