He ordered $N$ apples, where $N$ is a multiple of $K$. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. \nOnly two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put $K$ apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts $K$ apples in it.\nChef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?\nNote: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. \n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \"YES\" if the final distributions of apples can be different or \"NO\" if they will be the same (without quotes).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 250$\n- $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^{18}$\n- $N$ is divisible by $K$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (30 points): $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\n5 1\n4 2\n10 10\n\n-----Example Output-----\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: No matter who is hired, all apples will be in the only box at the end.\nExample case 2: At the end, there will be two apples in each box.\nExample case 3: If we hire the first candidate, there will be one apple in each box, but if we hire the second one, there will be $10$ apples in one box and none in all other boxes.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each candidate can distribute apples in a different way:\n- The first candidate distributes apples evenly, putting one apple in each box until all apples are distributed.\n- The second candidate puts all apples into the box with the fewest apples.\n\nGiven the number of apples \\( N \\) and the number of boxes \\( K \\), determine if the final distribution of apples can be different depending on which candidate is hired.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Distribution**:\n   - The first candidate will always distribute apples evenly across all boxes. If \\( N \\) is divisible by \\( K \\), each box will have \\( \\frac{N}{K} \\) apples.\n   - The second candidate will put all \\( K \\) apples into one box at a time. This means that after \\( \\frac{N}{K} \\) operations, one box will have all \\( N \\) apples, and the rest will have none.\n\n2. **Determine the Difference**:\n   - If \\( K = 1 \\), there's only one box, so both candidates will result in the same distribution.\n   - If \\( K > 1 \\), the first candidate will distribute apples evenly, while the second candidate will concentrate all apples in one box. Thus, the distributions will be different.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - If \\( K = 1 \\), output \"NO\".\n   - If \\( K > 1 \\), output \"YES\".\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction determine_distribution_difference(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K = test_case\n        if K == 1:\n            print \"NO\"\n        else:\n            print \"YES\"\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef determine_distribution_difference(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate over each test case\n    for N, K in test_cases:\n        # If there is only one box, both candidates will result in the same distribution\n        if K == 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            # If there are more than one box, the distributions will be different\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# First value is the number of test cases\nT = int(data[0])\n\n# Prepare the test cases\ntest_cases = []\nindex = 1\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    K = int(data[index + 1])\n    test_cases.append((N, K))\n    index += 2\n\n# Determine the distribution difference for each test case\ndetermine_distribution_difference(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case, and determines if the distribution of apples can be different based on the candidate hired. The logic is straightforward: if there is more than one box, the distributions will differ."

The key pattern is recognizing that for `N` days, the number of valid schedules can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the choices of dishes on the first, middle, and last days.\n\n    #### Strategy and Formula\n    Initially, the formula used was incorrect for `N > 3`. The correct approach is:\n    - For `N = 2`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n    - For `N = 3`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n    - For `N > 3`, the result should be \\(4 \\times 3^{N-2} \\times 2\\).\n\n    This formula accounts for:\n    - 4 choices for the first day.\n    - \\(3^{N-2}\\) choices for the middle days, ensuring no consecutive days are the same.\n    - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it's different from the first day.\n\n    #### Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the formula for `N > 3`, where the last multiplier was incorrectly set. The correct multiplier should ensure the first and last days are different, which is achieved by multiplying by 2, not 3. The misunderstanding of the expected output for `N = 5` was corrected by applying the correct formula, which results in 240, not 216.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            if N == 2:\n                result = 12\n            else:\n                result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n            results.append(result)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        results = calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly understanding the constraints and requirements of the problem, especially when dealing with large values of `N`.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.\n        Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.\n        Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.\n        Please help Salmon achieve this goal!\n\n        It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.\n\n        If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   \n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   \n        - The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   \n        - The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \\leq i \\leq N$\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        - Output $N$ lines for each testcase. \n        - The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \\leq m1,m2 \\leq K$ and $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$. \n        - Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$.\n        - The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $T=10$\n        - $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$ \n        - $2 \\leq K \\leq 10^5$ \n        - Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$\n        - There can be a color with $0$ ducks\n\n        -----Subtasks-----\n        - Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \\leq N \\leq 10$, $K=2$ \n        - Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$\n        - Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints\n\n        -----Sample Input:-----\n        1\n        2 4\n        3 4 1\n\n        -----Sample Output:-----\n        2 1 1 3\n        1 1 0 3\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        - In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   \n        - The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   \n        - Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:\n\n        ### Issues in the Current Solution\n\n        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The function `distribute_ducks` is defined but not called. This means that the code does not execute any logic or produce any output when run. The function should be called with appropriate arguments to process the input and produce the output.\n\n        2. **Reading from Standard Input**: The solution needs to read input directly from standard input, as the problem specifies that the input will be provided in this manner. The current code assumes input is passed as arguments to the function, which is not the case in the testing environment.\n\n        3. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should print the results directly to standard output, as specified in the problem statement.\n\n        4. **Logic for Filling Boxes**: The logic for filling the boxes seems correct in terms of the greedy approach, but it needs to be verified with the correct input/output handling.\n\n        ### Steps to Correct the Solution\n\n        1. **Read Input from Standard Input**: Use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and then parse it.\n\n        2. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the function is called with the parsed input data.\n\n        3. **Print Output to Standard Output**: Ensure that the results are printed in the correct format.\n\n        4. **Verify Logic**: Double-check the logic for filling the boxes to ensure it adheres to the constraints and requirements.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        Let's implement these corrections in the code:\n\n        ```python\n        def distribute_ducks():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N, K = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n                duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))\n                index += N + 1\n        \n                # List to store the result for each box\n                boxes = []\n        \n                # Create a list of (color, count) pairs\n                ducks = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]\n        \n                # While there are ducks left to place\n                while sum(count for _, count in ducks) > 0:\n                    # Sort ducks by count descending\n                    ducks.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])\n            \n                    # Start filling a new box\n                    c1, m1 = ducks[0][0], min(K, ducks[0][1])\n                    ducks[0] = (ducks[0][0], ducks[0][1] - m1)\n            \n                    if m1 < K:\n                        # Need to fill the rest of the box with another color\n                        c2, m2 = ducks[1][0], min(K - m1, ducks[1][1])\n                        ducks[1] = (ducks[1][0], ducks[1][1] - m2)\n                    else:\n                        # Box is full with one color\n                        c2, m2 = 0, 0\n            \n                    # Record the box\n                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))\n        \n                # Append the result for this test case\n                results.append(boxes)\n    \n            # Output the results\n            for boxes in results:\n                for box in boxes:\n                    print(f\"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute\n        distribute_ducks()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Changes\n\n        - **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read` and parsed into a list of strings.\n        - **Function Execution**: The function `distribute_ducks` is called directly to execute the logic.\n        - **Output**: The results are printed directly to standard output in the required format.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's fix the solution by ensuring that we handle input and output correctly, and that the logic for distributing ducks into boxes is executed properly.

In these cases, both candidates will end up with the same distribution.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction canDistributionsDiffer(T, test_cases):\n    for each (N, K) in test_cases:\n        if K == 1 or K == N:\n            print \"NO\"\n        else:\n            print \"YES\"\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef canDistributionsDiffer():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        if K == 1 or K == N:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings for easy access.\n- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, we extract \\( N \\) and \\( K \\).\n- **Decision Making**: We check if \\( K \\) is either 1 or equal to \\( N \\). If so, the distributions will be the same, and we print \"NO\". Otherwise, we print \"YES\" indicating the distributions can differ.\n- **Output**: We print the results for each test case."

The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.\n\n    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.\n\n    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.\n\n    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n        \n            sum_A = sum(A)\n            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                k = sum_A // sum_indices\n                possible = True\n                for i in range(N):\n                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                if possible:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.\n        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.

Otherwise, the distributions can differ, resulting in \"YES\".\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient, with a time complexity of \\( O(T) \\), where \\( T \\) is the number of test cases. It avoids unnecessary loops or complex operations, making it suitable for large input sizes.\n\n#### Lessons Learned:\n\n- **Mathematical Approach**: Sometimes, a mathematical insight can simplify a problem significantly, reducing the need for complex logic or simulations.\n- **Input/Output Handling**: Ensuring that functions are called and input/output is handled correctly is crucial in competitive programming environments.\n- **Condition Simplification**: Breaking down the problem to a simple condition check can lead to more efficient and elegant solutions.\n\nOverall, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient approach to solving the problem, highlighting the importance of mathematical reasoning in algorithm design."

This is particularly relevant in logistics, resource allocation, and load balancing problems where the method of distribution can affect the final state. Understanding this problem helps in recognizing that when the number of items is equal to the number of containers or when each container can only receive one item at a time, the distribution method does not matter. However, when the number of items is a multiple of the number of containers but not equal to it, different distribution strategies can lead to different outcomes. This concept is applicable in optimizing processes where the distribution method impacts efficiency or fairness."
