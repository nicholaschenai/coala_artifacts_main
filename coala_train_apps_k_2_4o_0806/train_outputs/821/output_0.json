    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Our task is to color each interval either blue or yellow such that the length of the X-axis that is covered by both blue and yellow intervals (i.e., the green part) is maximized. We need to output a string for each test case, where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval: '0' for blue and '1' for yellow.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green part is formed where blue and yellow intervals overlap. To maximize the green part, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible.\n\n2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.\n\n3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color the intervals:\n   - Iterate through the sorted intervals.\n   - Maintain two sets of intervals: one for blue and one for yellow.\n   - For each interval, decide whether to color it blue or yellow based on which choice maximizes the overlap with the other color.\n\n4. **Decision Making**: For each interval, check:\n   - If it overlaps with any interval in the blue set, color it yellow.\n   - If it overlaps with any interval in the yellow set, color it blue.\n   - If it overlaps with both, choose the color that results in the maximum overlap.\n\n5. **Output**: For each test case, output the coloring decision as a string of '0's and '1's.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction maximizeGreen(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        intervals = test_case\n        sort intervals by starting point\n        blue_intervals = []\n        yellow_intervals = []\n        result = []\n        \n        for interval in intervals:\n            if overlaps with any interval in blue_intervals:\n                color it yellow\n                add to yellow_intervals\n                result.append('1')\n            else:\n                color it blue\n                add to blue_intervals\n                result.append('0')\n        \n        print result as a string\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef maximizeGreen(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        # Sort intervals by their starting point\n        intervals.sort()\n        \n        # Initialize the result for this test case\n        result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n        \n        # Initialize the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals\n        last_blue_end = -1\n        last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n        for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals):\n            # If the current interval can overlap with the last blue interval\n            if L <= last_blue_end:\n                # Color it yellow\n                result[i] = '1'\n                # Update the last yellow end\n                last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, color it blue\n                result[i] = '0'\n                # Update the last blue end\n                last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)\n        \n        # Append the result for this test case\n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 1\n# test_cases = [\n#     [(3, 7), (2, 5), (6, 9)]\n# ]\n# maximizeGreen(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis code reads the number of test cases and intervals, sorts the intervals, and uses a greedy approach to color them to maximize the green part.
