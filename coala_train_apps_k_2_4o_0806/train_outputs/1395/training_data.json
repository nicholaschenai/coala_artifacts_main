    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to determine when two students, Ram and Shyam, would receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers and the number of question sets `p`. The key insight was recognizing that the condition for them to receive the same set is that the difference between their roll numbers, `|A-B|`, must be divisible by `p`. This led to the realization that the number of valid `p` values is equivalent to the number of divisors of `|A-B|`.\n\nThe solution involved:\n1. Calculating the absolute difference `|A-B|`.\n2. If `A` equals `B`, the result is `-1` because any `p` would work, indicating infinite solutions.\n3. Otherwise, counting the divisors of `|A-B|` to determine the number of valid `p` values.\n\nThe implementation used a helper function `countDivisors` to efficiently count the divisors of a number by iterating up to its square root. This approach ensures that the solution is efficient even for large values of `A` and `B`.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of understanding modular arithmetic and divisors in solving problems related to periodicity and equivalence classes. The solution was straightforward once the mathematical relationship was identified, and the implementation was efficient and passed all test cases.",
    "reflection": "The problem was straightforward, and my solution aligned well with the official solution. Both approaches focused on determining the number of divisors of the absolute difference `|A-B|` to find the number of valid `p` values. The key insight was recognizing that if `A == B`, there are infinitely many solutions, which is handled by checking if the difference is zero.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Condition Simplification**: The condition for Ram and Shyam to cheat boils down to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. This is because the condition `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` simplifies to `(A-B) % p == 0`.\n- **Handling Infinite Solutions**: If `A == B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many valid `p` values. This is efficiently handled by checking if `A` and `B` are equal and returning `-1` in such cases.\n- **Efficient Divisor Counting**: Both solutions use a loop up to the square root of the difference to count divisors efficiently, which is crucial for handling large numbers up to `10^8`.\n\n### Code Snippet:\nThe core logic for counting divisors is similar in both solutions:\n```python\ndef countDivisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return -1\n    count = 0\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            if i != n // i:\n                count += 1\n        i += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of simplifying conditions and efficiently counting divisors, which are common techniques in competitive programming.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThe function takes an integer T and a list of T pairs of integers as input, representing test cases. For each pair (A, B), it calculates the absolute difference between A and B. If the difference is zero, it appends -1 to the results list; otherwise, it appends the number of divisors of the difference. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where two entities need to have the same outcome based on a modular arithmetic distribution, such as distributing different sets of questions or tasks based on unique identifiers. The problem highlights the importance of understanding how differences in identifiers (like roll numbers) can affect the distribution of tasks or resources. It also demonstrates the use of finding divisors of a number to determine possible configurations or setups that meet a specific condition. This can be applied in scheduling, resource allocation, and cryptography where modular arithmetic plays a crucial role."
