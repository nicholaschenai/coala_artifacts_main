        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe have two students, Ram and Shyam, with roll numbers `A` and `B`. They can only cheat if they receive the same set of questions. The sets of questions are distributed based on the roll number modulo `p`, where `p` is the number of different sets. We need to determine how many values of `p` allow Ram and Shyam to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`. This implies that `A-1` and `B-1` must have the same remainder when divided by `p`.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `A - B = k * p`.\n\n3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The above equation implies that `p` must be a divisor of `|A - B|`. Therefore, the number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A - B|`.\n\n4. **Special Case**: If `A == B`, then `A - B = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to an infinite number of solutions. In this case, we return `-1`.\n\n5. **Iterating Over Test Cases**: For each test case, compute `|A - B|` and count its divisors to determine the number of valid `p` values.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return -1\n    count = 0\n    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            if i != n // i:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\nfunction solve(T, test_cases):\n    for each (A, B) in test_cases:\n        diff = abs(A - B)\n        result = count_divisors(diff)\n        print(result)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    # If n is zero, it means A and B are equal, leading to infinite solutions\n    if n == 0:\n        return -1\n    count = 0\n    # Check divisors up to the square root of n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            # If i is not the square root of n, count the complement divisor\n            if i != n // i:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        A = int(data[index])\n        B = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        diff = abs(A - B)\n        result = count_divisors(diff)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the number of valid `p` values for each case.

The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.\n\n    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.\n\n    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.\n\n    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n        \n            sum_A = sum(A)\n            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                k = sum_A // sum_indices\n                possible = True\n                for i in range(N):\n                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                if possible:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the main task was to find a pair of integers (A, B) for a given integer N such that \\(A \\oplus B = N\\) and \\(1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq N\\). The challenge was to efficiently compute the sum of the B values for a range of numbers [L, R] across multiple test cases.\n\n    ### Core Concepts:\n    - **XOR Operation**: Understanding how the XOR operation works was crucial. For each bit in the binary representation of N, A and B must differ if the bit is 1, and be the same if the bit is 0.\n    - **Iterative Search**: The solution involved iterating over possible values of A and computing B as \\(A \\oplus N\\). The condition \\(A \\leq B \\leq N\\) was checked to ensure a valid pair.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Brute Force with Constraints**: Although the problem could potentially involve a large number of computations, the constraints allowed for a straightforward brute force approach within the range [1, N] for each N.\n    - **Efficient Input Handling**: Given the large number of test cases, reading input efficiently and processing each test case in a loop was necessary.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def F(N):\n        for A in range(1, N + 1):\n            B = A ^ N\n            if A <= B <= N:\n                return B\n        return -1\n\n    def G(L, R):\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(L, R + 1):\n            total += F(i)\n        return total\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            L = int(data[index])\n            R = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = G(L, R)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding bitwise operations and efficiently handling large input sizes. The solution was straightforward once the XOR properties were clear, and the iterative approach was sufficient given the constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The exam board has `p` different sets of questions, and each student gets a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers `A` and `B` for Ram and Shyam, we need to determine how many values of `p` allow them to get the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: For Ram and Shyam to get the same set, the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)` must hold. This implies that `(A-1) % p` and `(B-1) % p` must be equal.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`, which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`.
