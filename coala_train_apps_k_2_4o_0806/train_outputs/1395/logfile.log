INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have two students, Ram and Shyam, with roll numbers `A` and `B`. They can only cheat if they receive the same set of questions. The sets of questions are distributed based on the roll number modulo `p`, where `p` is the number of different sets. We need to determine how many values of `p` allow Ram and Shyam to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`. This implies that `A-1` and `B-1` must have the same remainder when divided by `p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `A - B = k * p`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The above equation implies that `p` must be a divisor of `|A - B|`. Therefore, the number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A - B|`.

4. **Special Case**: If `A == B`, then `A - B = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to an infinite number of solutions. In this case, we return `-1`.

5. **Iterating Over Test Cases**: For each test case, compute `|A - B|` and count its divisors to determine the number of valid `p` values.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_divisors(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve(T, test_cases):
    for each (A, B) in test_cases:
        diff = abs(A - B)
        result = count_divisors(diff)
        print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_divisors(n):
    # If n is zero, it means A and B are equal, leading to infinite solutions
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    # Check divisors up to the square root of n
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            # If i is not the square root of n, count the complement divisor
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        result = count_divisors(diff)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the number of valid `p` values for each case. If `A` equals `B`, it outputs `-1` to indicate infinite solutions.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be made to sum to zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns

    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.

    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.

    #### Strategies and Errors

    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.

    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.

    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
        
            sum_A = sum(A)
            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
                k = sum_A // sum_indices
                possible = True
                for i in range(N):
                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):
                        possible = False
                        break
                if possible:
                    results.append("YES")
                else:
                    results.append("NO")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    is_good_sequence_possible()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to find a pair of integers (A, B) for a given integer N such that \(A \oplus B = N\) and \(1 \leq A \leq B \leq N\). The challenge was to efficiently compute the sum of the B values for a range of numbers [L, R] across multiple test cases.

    ### Core Concepts:
    - **XOR Operation**: Understanding how the XOR operation works was crucial. For each bit in the binary representation of N, A and B must differ if the bit is 1, and be the same if the bit is 0.
    - **Iterative Search**: The solution involved iterating over possible values of A and computing B as \(A \oplus N\). The condition \(A \leq B \leq N\) was checked to ensure a valid pair.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Brute Force with Constraints**: Although the problem could potentially involve a large number of computations, the constraints allowed for a straightforward brute force approach within the range [1, N] for each N.
    - **Efficient Input Handling**: Given the large number of test cases, reading input efficiently and processing each test case in a loop was necessary.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def F(N):
        for A in range(1, N + 1):
            B = A ^ N
            if A <= B <= N:
                return B
        return -1

    def G(L, R):
        total = 0
        for i in range(L, R + 1):
            total += F(i)
        return total

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            L = int(data[index])
            R = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = G(L, R)
            results.append(result)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding bitwise operations and efficiently handling large input sizes. The solution was straightforward once the XOR properties were clear, and the iterative approach was sufficient given the constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions, and each student gets a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers `A` and `B` for Ram and Shyam, we need to determine how many values of `p` allow them to get the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: For Ram and Shyam to get the same set, the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)` must hold. This implies that `(A-1) % p` and `(B-1) % p` must be equal.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`, which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) % p == 0`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|` to determine the number of valid `p` values.

### Pseudocode

```
function countDivisors(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each (A, B) in test_cases:
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    return results
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for A, B in test_cases:
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    return results

# Reading input and outputting results

input = sys.stdin.read

    B = int(data[index + 1])
    test_cases.append((A, B))
    index += 2

results = solve(T, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case to determine the number of valid `p` values, and outputs the result for each test case.

 ### Problem Restatement

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions, and each student gets a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers `A` and `B` for Ram and Shyam, we need to determine how many values of `p` allow them to get the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: For Ram and Shyam to get the same set, the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)` must hold. This implies that `(A-1) % p` and `(B-1) % p` must be equal.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`, which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) % p == 0`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions, and each student gets a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers `A` and `B` for Ram and Shyam, we need to determine how many values of `p` allow them to get the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: For Ram and Shyam to get the same set, the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)` must hold. This implies that `(A-1) % p` and `(B-1) % p` must be equal.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`, which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) % p == 0`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|` to determine the number of valid `p` values.

### Pseudocode

    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0

            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    return results
```

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to determine when two students, Ram and Shyam, would receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers and the number of question sets `p`. The key insight was recognizing that the condition for them to receive the same set is that the difference between their roll numbers, `|A-B|`, must be divisible by `p`. This led to the realization that the number of valid `p` values is equivalent to the number of divisors of `|A-B|`.

The solution involved:
1. Calculating the absolute difference `|A-B|`.
2. If `A` equals `B`, the result is `-1` because any `p` would work, indicating infinite solutions.
3. Otherwise, counting the divisors of `|A-B|` to determine the number of valid `p` values.

The implementation used a helper function `countDivisors` to efficiently count the divisors of a number by iterating up to its square root. This approach ensures that the solution is efficient even for large values of `A` and `B`.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding modular arithmetic and divisors in solving problems related to periodicity and equivalence classes. The solution was straightforward once the mathematical relationship was identified, and the implementation was efficient and passed all test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution aligned well with the official solution. Both approaches focused on determining the number of divisors of the absolute difference `|A-B|` to find the number of valid `p` values. The key insight was recognizing that if `A == B`, there are infinitely many solutions, which is handled by checking if the difference is zero.

### Key Insights:
- **Condition Simplification**: The condition for Ram and Shyam to cheat boils down to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. This is because the condition `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` simplifies to `(A-B) % p == 0`.
- **Handling Infinite Solutions**: If `A == B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many valid `p` values. This is efficiently handled by checking if `A` and `B` are equal and returning `-1` in such cases.
- **Efficient Divisor Counting**: Both solutions use a loop up to the square root of the difference to count divisors efficiently, which is crucial for handling large numbers up to `10^8`.

### Code Snippet:
The core logic for counting divisors is similar in both solutions:
```python
def countDivisors(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count
```

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of simplifying conditions and efficiently counting divisors, which are common techniques in competitive programming.

    Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
    - The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
    - If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
    Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
    You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 100$
    - $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

    -----Example Input-----
    1
    2 6

    -----Example Output-----
    3

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1: They can cheat for $p = 1$, $p = 2$ or $p = 4$.
