    "summary": "In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n- The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \\(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots\\).\n- The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: \n  \\[\n  S(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2N-1)}{6}\n  \\]\n  This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.\n\n### Strategy:\n- I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.\n- The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n```python\ndef calculate_nth_term(N):\n    return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        result = calculate_nth_term(N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.",
    "reflection": "In solving the problem of finding the N'th term in the series, I derived a formula based on the sum of squares, which was both efficient and straightforward. The official solution, however, takes a slightly different approach by adjusting the index and using a modified formula. \n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n- The official solution uses a different indexing approach by adjusting \\( n \\) with \\( n = n - 2 \\) and then applying a formula to compute the term. This adjustment accounts for the series starting at 0 for \\( N = 1 \\).\n- The formula used in the official solution is: \n  \\[\n  l = \\frac{(n+1) \\cdot (2n+3) \\cdot (n+2)}{6}\n  \\]\n  This formula is derived from the same principle of summing squares but is adapted to the series' specific starting point and pattern.\n\nReflection:\n- Both solutions effectively compute the N'th term in constant time, which is optimal given the constraints.\n- The official solution's approach to adjusting the index before applying the formula is a useful technique when dealing with series that do not start at a conventional index.\n- Understanding different ways to derive and apply mathematical formulas to solve series problems can be beneficial for tackling similar problems in the future.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases, followed by T integers. For each integer N, it calculates the N'th term using a specific formula and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints each calculated result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to generate or identify terms in a specific mathematical series, particularly one that can be expressed using a formula involving sums of squares. The problem involves understanding how to derive a formula for a series and then efficiently compute terms of the series for large inputs, which is common in competitive programming and algorithm design. The solution demonstrates how to handle multiple test cases and efficiently compute results using mathematical formulas, which is a valuable skill in optimizing code for performance."
