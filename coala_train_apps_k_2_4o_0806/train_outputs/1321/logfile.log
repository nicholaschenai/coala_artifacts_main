INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... and need to find the N'th number in this series for multiple test cases. The series is defined by a specific pattern, and we need to determine this pattern to compute the N'th term efficiently.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   - By examining the differences between consecutive terms, we can identify a pattern:
     - 1 - 0 = 1
     - 5 - 1 = 4
     - 14 - 5 = 9
     - 30 - 14 = 16
     - 55 - 30 = 25
   - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

2. **Formulate the Series**:
   - The N'th term can be expressed as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.
   - The formula for the N'th term is: `S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (N-1)^2`.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Use the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
   - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term in constant time.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula and output the result.

## Pseudocode

```
function sum_of_squares(n):
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) // 6

function find_nth_term(N):
    if N == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return sum_of_squares(N-1)

read T
for each test case:
    read N
    result = find_nth_term(N)
    print result
```

## Python Code

```python
def sum_of_squares(n):
    # Calculate the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6

def find_nth_term(N):
    # If N is 1, the term is 0
    if N == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        # Otherwise, calculate the sum of squares up to (N-1)
        return sum_of_squares(N - 1)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = find_nth_term(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

main()
```

This code reads input from standard input, computes the N'th term for each test case using the derived formula, and outputs the results. The use of the sum of squares formula ensures that each term is computed efficiently in constant time.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Pattern Generation Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating a specific pattern based on an integer \( K \) for multiple test cases. Each test case requires generating \( K \) lines, where each line \( i \) consists of numbers starting from \( i \) down to 0, followed by numbers from 1 up to \( i \). The challenge is to ensure that the output for each test case is formatted correctly, with each test case's output separated by a blank line.

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the approach was to generate and print each line of the pattern directly within the `generate_pattern` function. However, this led to issues with output formatting, particularly with extra or missing lines between test cases. The key mistake was not managing the separation between test cases correctly, which resulted in incorrect output.

    #### Fixes and Final Solution
    The solution was refined by collecting the results for each test case in a list and then joining these results with a double newline (`\n\n`) to ensure proper separation between test cases. This approach ensures that each test case's output is printed consecutively, with a blank line between different test cases, but no extra blank lines at the end. This adjustment resolved the formatting issues and produced the expected output.

    #### Final Code Snippet
    ```python
    def generate_pattern(K):
        for i in range(K):
            line = []
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line.append(str(j))
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line.append(str(j))
            print("".join(line))

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().strip().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for test_case in range(T):
            K = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            result = []
            for i in range(K):
                line = []
                for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                    line.append(str(j))
                for j in range(1, i + 1):
                    line.append(str(j))
                result.append("".join(line))
            results.append("\n".join(result))
    
        print("\n\n".join(results))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing output formatting, especially when dealing with multiple test cases and ensuring that the output matches the expected format precisely.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":

    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.

We need to find the N'th number in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... Given a number of test cases, each with a single integer N, we need to output the N'th number in this series.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   - Observing the differences between consecutive terms: 
     - 1 - 0 = 1
     - 5 - 1 = 4
     - 14 - 5 = 9
     - 30 - 14 = 16
     - 55 - 30 = 25
   - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, \ldots\).

2. **Formulate the Series**:
   - The N'th term in the series can be calculated as the sum of squares from 1 to \(N-1\).
   - Formula: \( S(N) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i^2 \)

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Use the formula for the sum of squares: 
     \[
     S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
     \]
   - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term directly without iterating through all previous terms.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases, \( T \).
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer \( N \).
   - Calculate the N'th term using the formula:
     \[
     \text{term} = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
     \]
   - Output the calculated term.

### Python Code

```python
def calculate_nth_term(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
    return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

        results.append(result)

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the N'th number in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... Given a number of test cases, each with a single integer N, we need to output the N'th number in this series.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   - Observing the differences between consecutive terms: 
     - 1 - 0 = 1
     - 5 - 1 = 4
     - 14 - 5 = 9
     - 30 - 14 = 16
     - 55 - 30 = 25
   - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, \ldots\).

2. **Formulate the Series**:
   - The N'th term in the series can be calculated as the sum of squares from 1 to \(N-1\).
   - Formula: \( S(N) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i^2 \)

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Use the formula for the sum of squares: 
     \[
     S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
     \]
   - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term directly without iterating through all previous terms.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases, \( T \).
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer \( N \).
   - Calculate the N'th term using the formula:
     \[
     \text{term} = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
     \]
   - Output the calculated term.

### Python Code

```python
def calculate_nth_term(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
    return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = calculate_nth_term(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Function `calculate_nth_term(N)`**: Computes the N'th term in the series using the formula for the sum of squares.
- **`main()` Function**: 
  - Reads input data.
  - Iterates over each test case, computes the result using `calculate_nth_term`, and stores it.
  - Outputs all results at the end. 
- The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the result is an integer, as expected for the series terms.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

### Key Concepts and Patterns:
- The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
- The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
  \[
  S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
  \]
  This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

### Strategy:
- I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
- The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

### Code Snippet:
```python
def calculate_nth_term(N):
    return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = calculate_nth_term(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.

We need to find the N'th number in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... Given a number of test cases, each with a single integer N, we need to output the N'th number in this series.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   - Observing the differences between consecutive terms: 
     - 1 - 0 = 1
     - 5 - 1 = 4
     - 14 - 5 = 9
     - 30 - 14 = 16
     - 55 - 30 = 25
   - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, \ldots\).

2. **Formulate the Series**:
   - The N'th term in the series can be calculated as the sum of squares from 1 to \(N-1\).
   - Formula: \( S(N) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i^2 \)

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Use the formula for the sum of squares: 
     \[
     S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
     \]
   - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term directly without iterating through all previous terms.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases, \( T \).
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer \( N \).
   - Calculate the N'th term using the formula:
     \[
     \text{term} = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
     \]
   - Output the calculated term.

### Python Code

```python
def calculate_nth_term(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
    return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    n=int(input())
    if n==1:
        print("0")
    else:
        n=n-2
        l=(n+1)*(2*n+3)*(n+2)/6
        print(int(l))


INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] In solving the problem of finding the N'th term in the series, I derived a formula based on the sum of squares, which was both efficient and straightforward. The official solution, however, takes a slightly different approach by adjusting the index and using a modified formula. 

Key insights from the official solution:
- The official solution uses a different indexing approach by adjusting \( n \) with \( n = n - 2 \) and then applying a formula to compute the term. This adjustment accounts for the series starting at 0 for \( N = 1 \).
- The formula used in the official solution is: 
  \[
  l = \frac{(n+1) \cdot (2n+3) \cdot (n+2)}{6}
  \]
  This formula is derived from the same principle of summing squares but is adapted to the series' specific starting point and pattern.

Reflection:
- Both solutions effectively compute the N'th term in constant time, which is optimal given the constraints.
- The official solution's approach to adjusting the index before applying the formula is a useful technique when dealing with series that do not start at a conventional index.
- Understanding different ways to derive and apply mathematical formulas to solve series problems can be beneficial for tackling similar problems in the future.
