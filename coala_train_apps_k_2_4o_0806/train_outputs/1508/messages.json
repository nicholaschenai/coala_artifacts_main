The digits in each line are determined by the following rules:\n- If the line number `i` is even, the digits are in increasing order starting from `0` up to `K-1`.\n- If the line number `i` is odd, the digits are in decreasing order starting from `K-1` down to `0`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Read the number of test cases `T`.\n2. For each test case, read the integer `K`.\n3.

The expected output for each test case is a block of lines, each representing a pattern for a given \\( K \\). However, the current implementation seems to be printing additional lines or incorrect sequences.\n\n### Step-by-Step Debugging\n\n1. **Understanding the Output Format**: Each test case should produce a block of \\( K \\) lines. Each line should be printed consecutively without any extra lines or characters in between.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Code**:\n   - The `generate_pattern` function is responsible for creating and printing the pattern for each test case.\n   - The `main` function reads input and calls `generate_pattern` for each test case.\n\n3. **Identifying the Mistake**:\n   - The code might be printing extra lines or incorrect sequences due to incorrect loop logic or incorrect handling of the input data.\n   - The `generate_pattern` function should correctly handle the sequence generation and ensure that each line is printed exactly once per test case.\n\n4. **Correcting the Logic**:\n   - Ensure that the `generate_pattern` function correctly constructs each line and prints it without any additional characters or lines.\n   - Ensure that the input is correctly parsed and each test case is handled independently.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\nLet's correct the code to ensure it outputs the expected pattern for each test case.\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(K):\n    for i in range(K):\n        line = []\n        # Descending part\n        for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n            line.append(str(j))\n        # Ascending part\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            line.append(str(j))\n        # Print the line as a string\n        print(\"\".join(line))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(T):\n        K = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        generate_pattern(K)\n        if _ < T - 1:\n            print()  # Print a blank line between test cases\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Fix\n\n- **Blank Line Between Test Cases**: After generating the pattern for each test case, a blank line is printed to separate the outputs of different test cases. This is done only if there are more test cases to process.\n- **Correct Sequence Generation**: The `generate_pattern` function correctly constructs each line by appending numbers in descending and ascending order, ensuring the pattern is as expected.\n- **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed correctly, ensuring each test case is processed independently."

Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.\n        Note f([1]) = 0.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation.

If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: \n           - For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN), the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair: max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).\n\n        2. **Constraints and Observations**:\n           - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.\n           - The minimum possible value of f(P) is the sum of the smallest N-1 numbers, i.e., 2 + 3 + ... + N.\n\n        3. **Strategy**:\n           - Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P) for the given N.\n           - If K is greater than this maximum, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.\n           - If K is less than the minimum possible value, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.\n           - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.\n\n        4. **Constructing the Permutation**:\n           - Start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible f(P).\n           - Adjust the permutation to decrease the sum to K by swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function find_permutation(N, K):\n            max_possible = sum of largest N-1 numbers\n            min_possible = sum of smallest N-1 numbers\n    \n            if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:\n                return -1\n    \n            permutation = list of numbers from N to 1 (descending order)\n            current_sum = max_possible\n    \n            for i from 0 to N-2:\n                if current_sum == K:\n                    break\n                for j from N-1 down to i+1:\n                    if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:\n                        current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])\n                        swap permutation[i] and permutation[j]\n                        break\n    \n            return permutation\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation(N, K):\n            # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)\n            max_possible = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n            # Calculate the minimum possible value of f(P)\n            min_possible = sum(range(1, N))\n    \n            if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:\n                return -1\n    \n            # Start with the permutation in descending order\n            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n            current_sum = max_possible\n    \n            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K\n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                if current_sum == K:\n                    break\n                for j in range(N - 1, i, -1):\n                    if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:\n                        current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])\n                        permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]\n                        break\n    \n            return permutation\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                result = find_permutation(N, K)\n                if result == -1:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently calculates the permutation for each test case by starting with the maximum possible sum and adjusting it to match the desired K.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['3', '4 12', '2 2', '5 14'] Output: [{'-1'}, {'2', '1'}, {'2', '5', '3', '1', '4'}]\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Reference Code (Not callable)]:\n\n    [description for function: main]\n    The function reads input from standard input, which includes a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers, N and K. It then calls another function to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific sum condition is met, or returns -1 if it's not possible.

Each test case requires generating \\( K \\) lines, where each line \\( i \\) consists of numbers starting from \\( i \\) down to 0, followed by numbers from 1 up to \\( i \\). The challenge is to ensure that the output for each test case is formatted correctly, with each test case's output separated by a blank line.\n\n#### Strategies and Errors\nInitially, the approach was to generate and print each line of the pattern directly within the `generate_pattern` function. However, this led to issues with output formatting, particularly with extra or missing lines between test cases. The key mistake was not managing the separation between test cases correctly, which resulted in incorrect output.\n\n#### Fixes and Final Solution\nThe solution was refined by collecting the results for each test case in a list and then joining these results with a double newline (`\\n\\n`) to ensure proper separation between test cases. This approach ensures that each test case's output is printed consecutively, with a blank line between different test cases, but no extra blank lines at the end. This adjustment resolved the formatting issues and produced the expected output.\n\n#### Final Code Snippet\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(K):\n    for i in range(K):\n        line = []\n        for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n            line.append(str(j))\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            line.append(str(j))\n        print(\"\".join(line))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    for test_case in range(T):\n        K = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        result = []\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = []\n            for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            result.append(\"\".join(line))\n        results.append(\"\\n\".join(result))\n    \n    print(\"\\n\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing output formatting, especially when dealing with multiple test cases and ensuring that the output matches the expected format precisely."

The key issues were:\n\n1. **Pattern Generation**: My approach was not correctly generating the sequences for each line, especially when handling the descending and ascending parts of the pattern.\n\n2. **Output Formatting**: I struggled with correctly formatting the output, particularly ensuring that each test case's output was separated by a blank line without extra lines.\n\n### Insights from the Official Solution\n\nThe official solution provided a more straightforward approach to generating the pattern:\n\n- **Pattern Construction**: The official solution constructs the initial sequence for the first line and then iteratively modifies it for subsequent lines by popping the last element and prepending a new starting number. This approach simplifies the generation of each line by reusing and modifying the previous line's sequence.\n\n- **Output Handling**: The solution directly prints each line as it is generated, ensuring that the output is formatted correctly without needing to manage separate lists or additional formatting logic.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Iterative Modification**: The official solution's use of iterative modification of a list to generate each line of the pattern is efficient and reduces complexity. This approach can be useful in similar problems where patterns are generated based on previous states.\n\n- **Direct Output**: Printing each line as it is generated simplifies the output handling and avoids issues with managing and formatting multiple test cases.\n\nIn future problems, considering iterative approaches and direct output handling can help simplify the solution and avoid common pitfalls with formatting and sequence generation."
