## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
4 5
I::M
9 10
MIM_XII:M

-----Example Output-----
1
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a row of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is calculated as `P = K + 1 - |j-i| - S`, where `|j-i|` is the distance between the magnet and iron, and `S` is the number of conducting sheets between them. The attraction is only possible if `P > 0` and there are no blocks ('X') between them. We need to find the maximum number of such magnet-iron pairs for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation**: First, split the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.
2. **Pairing**: For each segment, attempt to pair magnets and irons:
   - Use two lists to track the positions of magnets and irons.
   - Iterate through the segment, and for each magnet, try to find the nearest iron that can be attracted.
   - Calculate the attraction power considering the distance and the number of conducting sheets.
   - If the attraction power is positive, pair the magnet with the iron and remove both from their respective lists.
3. **Count Pairs**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the total result of the test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_magnets(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test case:
        N, K, S = test case
        segments = split S by 'X'
        total_pairs = 0
        for each segment in segments:
            magnets = []
            irons = []
            sheets_count = 0
            for each character in segment:
                if character is 'M':
                    add position to magnets
                if character is 'I':
                    add position to irons
                if character is ':':
                    increment sheets_count
            while both magnets and irons are not empty:
                magnet_pos = first element in magnets
                iron_pos = first element in irons
                distance = abs(magnet_pos - iron_pos)
                if magnet_pos < iron_pos:
                    sheets_between = count sheets between magnet_pos and iron_pos
                else:
                    sheets_between = count sheets between iron_pos and magnet_pos
                attraction_power = K + 1 - distance - sheets_between
                if attraction_power > 0:
                    increment total_pairs
                    remove first element from magnets
                    remove first element from irons
                else:
                    if magnet_pos < iron_pos:
                        remove first element from magnets
                    else:
                        remove first element from irons
        append total_pairs to results
    return results
```

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
4 5
I::M
9 10
MIM_XII:M

-----Example Output-----
1
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.

        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a sequence of numbers from 1 to N, and we need to find a permutation of these numbers such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair is equal to a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: 
           - For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN), the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair: max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

        2. **Constraints and Observations**:
           - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.
           - The minimum possible value of f(P) is the sum of the smallest N-1 numbers, i.e., 2 + 3 + ... + N.

        3. **Strategy**:
           - Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P) for the given N.
           - If K is greater than this maximum, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.
           - If K is less than the minimum possible value, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.
           - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

        4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
           - Start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible f(P).
           - Adjust the permutation to decrease the sum to K by swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function find_permutation(N, K):
            max_possible = sum of largest N-1 numbers
            min_possible = sum of smallest N-1 numbers
    
            if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:
                return -1
    
            permutation = list of numbers from N to 1 (descending order)
            current_sum = max_possible
    
            for i from 0 to N-2:
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                for j from N-1 down to i+1:
                    if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                        current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                        swap permutation[i] and permutation[j]
                        break
    
            return permutation
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def find_permutation(N, K):
            # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)
            max_possible = sum(range(2, N + 1))
            # Calculate the minimum possible value of f(P)
            min_possible = sum(range(1, N))
    
            if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:
                return -1
    
            # Start with the permutation in descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_possible

                        current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                        permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]
                        break
    
            return permutation

        This solution efficiently calculates the permutation for each test case by starting with the maximum possible sum and adjusting it to match the desired K.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is determined by the formula \( P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j} \), where \( S_{i,j} \) is the number of conducting sheets between them. The attraction is only possible if \( P_{i,j} > 0 \) and there are no blocks between them.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: First, divide the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.

2. **Iterate through Segments**: For each segment, track the positions of magnets and irons.

3. **Calculate Attraction**: For each magnet, check if it can attract any iron to its right or left within the same segment. Use a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the attraction power, considering the number of conducting sheets.

4. **Match Magnets and Irons**: Use a greedy approach to match magnets with irons, ensuring that each iron is attracted by at most one magnet.

5. **Count Matches**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the final result.

## Pseudocode

            for i, char in enumerate(segment):
                if char == 'M':
                    magnets.append((i, sheets_count))
                elif char == 'I':

 ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is determined by the formula \( P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j} \), where \( S_{i,j} \) is the number of conducting sheets between them. The attraction is only possible if \( P_{i,j} > 0 \) and there are no blocks between them.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: First, divide the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.

2. **Iterate through Segments**: For each segment, track the positions of magnets and irons.

3. **Calculate Attraction**: For each magnet, check if it can attract any iron to its right or left within the same segment. Use a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the attraction power, considering the number of conducting sheets.

4. **Match Magnets and Irons**: Use a greedy approach to match magnets with irons, ensuring that each iron is attracted by at most one magnet.

5. **Count Matches**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the final result.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
4 5
I::M
9 10
MIM_XII:M

-----Example Output-----
1
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is determined by the formula \( P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j} \), where \( S_{i,j} \) is the number of conducting sheets between them. The attraction is only possible if \( P_{i,j} > 0 \) and there are no blocks between them.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: First, divide the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.

2. **Iterate through Segments**: For each segment, track the positions of magnets and irons.

3. **Calculate Attraction**: For each magnet, check if it can attract any iron to its right or left within the same segment. Use a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the attraction power, considering the number of conducting sheets.

4. **Match Magnets and Irons**: Use a greedy approach to match magnets with irons, ensuring that each iron is attracted by at most one magnet.

5. **Count Matches**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the final result.

This solution efficiently processes each test case by dividing the string into segments, tracking magnets and irons, and matching them based on the attraction power formula. The use of a sliding window approach ensures that the solution is optimal for large inputs.

## Instructions
Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently match magnets ('M') with irons ('I') in a sequence, considering the constraints of attraction power and blockages. The key challenge was to handle the constraints of conducting sheets (':') and blocks ('X') while ensuring that the solution is optimal given the large input size constraints.

The successful strategy involved segmenting the input string by blocks ('X'), as no attraction can occur across these. Within each segment, I tracked the positions of magnets and irons, along with the count of conducting sheets encountered. Using a two-pointer technique, I matched magnets and irons by calculating the attraction power and ensuring it was positive. This approach allowed for efficient matching without unnecessary recalculations, adhering to the constraints.

The solution was implemented using a sliding window approach, which is optimal for large inputs due to its linear complexity relative to the segment size. This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down problems into manageable segments and using efficient data structures and algorithms to handle constraints effectively. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness and efficiency.

This solution efficiently processes each test case by dividing the string into segments, tracking magnets and irons, and matching them based on the attraction power formula. The use of a sliding window approach ensures that the solution is optimal for large inputs.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] The problem-solving experience for this task was insightful, particularly in understanding how to efficiently handle constraints and optimize the solution for large inputs.

### Key Insights:

1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: Both my solution and the official solution correctly identified the need to segment the string by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block. This segmentation simplifies the problem by allowing us to focus on smaller, independent segments.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: The official solution uses a two-pointer technique to traverse the string, which is efficient for this type of problem. This approach allows simultaneous tracking of magnets and irons, making it easier to calculate attraction power and match them.

3. **Counting Conducting Sheets**: The official solution counts the conducting sheets between a magnet and iron dynamically as it checks each pair. This is a more direct approach compared to maintaining separate lists for magnets and irons, as I did in my solution.

4. **Greedy Matching**: The official solution uses a greedy approach to match magnets and irons, ensuring that each iron is attracted by at most one magnet. This is crucial for maximizing the number of successful matches.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution efficiently handles edge cases, such as when encountering a block ('X'), by resetting the pointers to start a new segment.

### Reflection:

The official solution is more concise and directly addresses the problem constraints by using a two-pointer approach, which is both time and space efficient. My initial solution was correct but could be optimized by adopting a similar two-pointer strategy and simplifying the handling of conducting sheets. This experience reinforced the importance of considering efficient traversal techniques and dynamic counting in problems involving sequences and constraints.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently match magnets ('M') with irons ('I') in a sequence, considering the constraints of attraction power and blockages.

[Problem]
    Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
    - 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
    - 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
    - '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
    - ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
    - 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
    If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
    Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
    - The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 2,000$
    - $1 \le N \le 10^5$
    - $0 \le K \le 10^5$
    - $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
    - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'
    Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

    -----Example Input-----
    2
    4 5
    I::M
    9 10
    MIM_XII:M

    -----Example Output-----
    1
    2

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
    Example case 2:
    The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
    The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.
