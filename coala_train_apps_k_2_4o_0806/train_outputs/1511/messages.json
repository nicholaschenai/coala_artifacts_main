He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:\n- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron\n- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet\n- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty\n- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet\n- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked\nIf there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.\nChef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.\n- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 2,000$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- $0 \\le K \\le 10^5$\n- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^6$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n2\n4 5\nI::M\n9 10\nMIM_XII:M\n\n-----Example Output-----\n1\n2\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.\nExample case 2:\nThe magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.\nThe magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is calculated as `P = K + 1 - |j-i| - S`, where `|j-i|` is the distance between the magnet and iron, and `S` is the number of conducting sheets between them. The attraction is only possible if `P > 0` and there are no blocks ('X') between them. We need to find the maximum number of such magnet-iron pairs for each test case.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Segmentation**: First, split the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.\n2. **Pairing**: For each segment, attempt to pair magnets and irons:\n   - Use two lists to track the positions of magnets and irons.\n   - Iterate through the segment, and for each magnet, try to find the nearest iron that can be attracted.\n   - Calculate the attraction power considering the distance and the number of conducting sheets.\n   - If the attraction power is positive, pair the magnet with the iron and remove both from their respective lists.\n3. **Count Pairs**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the total result of the test case.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_magnets(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test case:\n        N, K, S = test case\n        segments = split S by 'X'\n        total_pairs = 0\n        for each segment in segments:\n            magnets = []\n            irons = []\n            sheets_count = 0\n            for each character in segment:\n                if character is 'M':\n                    add position to magnets\n                if character is 'I':\n                    add position to irons\n                if character is ':':\n                    increment sheets_count\n            while both magnets and irons are not empty:\n                magnet_pos = first element in magnets\n                iron_pos = first element in irons\n                distance = abs(magnet_pos - iron_pos)\n                if magnet_pos < iron_pos:\n                    sheets_between = count sheets between magnet_pos and iron_pos\n                else:\n                    sheets_between = count sheets between iron_pos and magnet_pos\n                attraction_power = K + 1 - distance - sheets_between\n                if attraction_power > 0:\n                    increment total_pairs\n                    remove first element from magnets\n                    remove first element from irons\n                else:\n                    if magnet_pos < iron_pos:\n                        remove first element from magnets\n                    else:\n                        remove first element from irons\n        append total_pairs to results\n    return results\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef max_magnets(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K, S = case\n        segments = S.split('X')\n        total_pairs = 0\n        \n        for segment in segments:\n            magnets = []\n            irons = []\n            sheets_count = 0\n            sheet_positions = []\n            \n            # Collect positions of magnets, irons, and sheets\n            for i, char in enumerate(segment):\n                if char == 'M':\n                    magnets.append(i)\n                elif char == 'I':\n                    irons.append(i)\n                elif char == ':':\n                    sheet_positions.append(i)\n            \n            # Try to pair magnets and irons\n            while magnets and irons:\n                magnet_pos = magnets[0]\n                iron_pos = irons[0]\n                \n                # Calculate the number of sheets between the magnet and iron\n                if magnet_pos < iron_pos:\n                    sheets_between = sum(1 for pos in sheet_positions if magnet_pos < pos < iron_pos)\n                else:\n                    sheets_between = sum(1 for pos in sheet_positions if iron_pos < pos < magnet_pos)\n                \n                # Calculate attraction power\n                attraction_power = K + 1 - abs(magnet_pos - iron_pos) - sheets_between\n                \n                if attraction_power > 0:\n                    total_pairs += 1\n                    magnets.pop(0)\n                    irons.pop(0)\n                else:\n                    if magnet_pos < iron_pos:\n                        magnets.pop(0)\n                    else:\n                        irons.pop(0)\n        \n        results.append(total_pairs)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    K = int(data[index + 1])\n    S = data[index + 2]\n    test_cases.append((N, K, S))\n    index += 3\n\n# Get results\nresults = max_magnets(T, test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```"

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.\n\n    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes\n    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves:\n    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.\n    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.\n    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):\n        max_sum = 0\n        current_sum = 0\n        n = len(strengths)\n    \n        i = 0\n        while i < n:\n            # Start a new subsequence with the current element\n            current_sum = strengths[i]\n            i += 1\n        \n            # Alternate between adding and subtracting\n            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:\n                current_sum += strengths[i]\n                i += 1\n        \n            # Update the maximum sum found\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n    \n        return max_sum\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0\n            index += 2\n        \n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n        \n            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).\n        You are given N and an integer K.

The attraction is only possible if \\( P_{i,j} > 0 \\) and there are no blocks between them.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: First, divide the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.\n\n2. **Iterate through Segments**: For each segment, track the positions of magnets and irons.\n\n3. **Calculate Attraction**: For each magnet, check if it can attract any iron to its right or left within the same segment. Use a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the attraction power, considering the number of conducting sheets.\n\n4. **Match Magnets and Irons**: Use a greedy approach to match magnets with irons, ensuring that each iron is attracted by at most one magnet.\n\n5. **Count Matches**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the final result.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_magnets(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, S = test_case\n        segments = split S by 'X'\n        total_matches = 0\n        for segment in segments:\n            magnets = []\n            irons = []\n            sheets_count = 0\n            for i, char in enumerate(segment):\n                if char == 'M':\n                    magnets.append((i, sheets_count))\n                elif char == 'I':\n                    irons.append((i, sheets_count))\n                elif char == ':':\n                    sheets_count += 1\n            \n            # Match magnets and irons\n            i, j = 0, 0\n            matches = 0\n            while i < len(magnets) and j < len(irons):\n                m_pos, m_sheets = magnets[i]\n                i_pos, i_sheets = irons[j]\n                distance = abs(m_pos - i_pos)\n                total_sheets = abs(m_sheets - i_sheets)\n                attraction_power = K + 1 - distance - total_sheets\n                if attraction_power > 0:\n                    matches += 1\n                    i += 1\n                    j += 1\n                elif m_pos < i_pos:\n                    i += 1\n                else:\n                    j += 1\n            \n            total_matches += matches\n        results.append(total_matches)\n    return results\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_magnets(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, S = test_case\n        segments = S.split('X')\n        total_matches = 0\n        for segment in segments:\n            magnets = []\n            irons = []\n            sheets_count = 0\n            for i, char in enumerate(segment):\n                if char == 'M':\n                    magnets.append((i, sheets_count))\n                elif char == 'I':\n                    irons.append((i, sheets_count))\n                elif char == ':':\n                    sheets_count += 1\n            \n            # Match magnets and irons\n            i, j = 0, 0\n            matches = 0\n            while i < len(magnets) and j < len(irons):\n                m_pos, m_sheets = magnets[i]\n                i_pos, i_sheets = irons[j]\n                distance = abs(m_pos - i_pos)\n                total_sheets = abs(m_sheets - i_sheets)\n                attraction_power = K + 1 - distance - total_sheets\n                if attraction_power > 0:\n                    matches += 1\n                    i += 1\n                    j += 1\n                elif m_pos < i_pos:\n                    i += 1\n                else:\n                    j += 1\n            \n            total_matches += matches\n        results.append(total_matches)\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        S = data[index + 2]\n        index += 3\n        test_cases.append((N, K, S))\n    \n    results = max_magnets(T, test_cases)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently processes each test case by dividing the string into segments, tracking magnets and irons, and matching them based on the attraction power formula.

        "content": "In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently match magnets ('M') with irons ('I') in a sequence, considering the constraints of attraction power and blockages. The key challenge was to handle the constraints of conducting sheets (':') and blocks ('X') while ensuring that the solution is optimal given the large input size constraints.\n\nThe successful strategy involved segmenting the input string by blocks ('X'), as no attraction can occur across these. Within each segment, I tracked the positions of magnets and irons, along with the count of conducting sheets encountered. Using a two-pointer technique, I matched magnets and irons by calculating the attraction power and ensuring it was positive. This approach allowed for efficient matching without unnecessary recalculations, adhering to the constraints.\n\nThe solution was implemented using a sliding window approach, which is optimal for large inputs due to its linear complexity relative to the segment size. This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down problems into manageable segments and using efficient data structures and algorithms to handle constraints effectively. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness and efficiency."

This segmentation simplifies the problem by allowing us to focus on smaller, independent segments.\n\n2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: The official solution uses a two-pointer technique to traverse the string, which is efficient for this type of problem. This approach allows simultaneous tracking of magnets and irons, making it easier to calculate attraction power and match them.\n\n3. **Counting Conducting Sheets**: The official solution counts the conducting sheets between a magnet and iron dynamically as it checks each pair. This is a more direct approach compared to maintaining separate lists for magnets and irons, as I did in my solution.\n\n4. **Greedy Matching**: The official solution uses a greedy approach to match magnets and irons, ensuring that each iron is attracted by at most one magnet. This is crucial for maximizing the number of successful matches.\n\n5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution efficiently handles edge cases, such as when encountering a block ('X'), by resetting the pointers to start a new segment.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution is more concise and directly addresses the problem constraints by using a two-pointer approach, which is both time and space efficient. My initial solution was correct but could be optimized by adopting a similar two-pointer strategy and simplifying the handling of conducting sheets.

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and for each test case, the length of the string, the attraction power, and the string itself. It then processes each test case to determine the maximum number of magnet-iron pairs that can be attracted to each other, considering the presence of sheets that reduce attraction power. The function splits the string by 'X' to handle segments separately and uses two lists to track the positions and sheet counts of magnets and irons. It calculates the attraction power between each magnet and iron pair, accounting for distance and sheets, and counts valid pairs. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to solve problems involving matching pairs with constraints, such as in optimization problems where certain conditions must be met for a pair to be valid. The problem involves calculating an attraction power based on distance and intervening elements, which is a common pattern in problems involving spatial relationships and constraints. This can be applied to logistics, network design, or any situation where entities must be paired based on proximity and intervening factors. The solution also demonstrates efficient string processing and handling of multiple test cases, which is useful in competitive programming and real-world applications where performance is critical."
