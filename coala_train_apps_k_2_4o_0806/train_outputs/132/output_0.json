    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nYou are given a list of days on which you plan to travel and the costs of three types of train passes: a 1-day pass, a 7-day pass, and a 30-day pass. Each pass allows you to travel for the specified number of consecutive days. The goal is to determine the minimum cost required to cover all the travel days using these passes.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to calculate the minimum cost to cover travel up to each day in the year. We will maintain a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel up to day `i`.\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with a `dp` array of size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365) initialized to 0. This array will store the minimum cost to cover travel up to each day.\n\n2. **Iterate through each day**: For each day in the year (from 1 to 365), check if it is a travel day. If it is not a travel day, the cost remains the same as the previous day. If it is a travel day, calculate the cost for each type of pass and update `dp[i]` with the minimum cost.\n\n3. **Cost Calculation**:\n   - For a 1-day pass, add the cost of a 1-day pass to `dp[i-1]`.\n   - For a 7-day pass, add the cost of a 7-day pass to `dp[i-7]` (or 0 if `i-7` is less than 0).\n   - For a 30-day pass, add the cost of a 30-day pass to `dp[i-30]` (or 0 if `i-30` is less than 0).\n\n4. **Result**: The value at `dp[365]` will give the minimum cost to cover all travel days.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction mincostTickets(days, costs):\n    create a set from days for quick lookup\n    initialize dp array of size 366 with 0\n\n    for i from 1 to 365:\n        if i is not in days set:\n            dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        else:\n            cost1 = dp[i-1] + costs[0]\n            cost7 = dp[i-7] + costs[1] if i-7 >= 0 else costs[1]\n            cost30 = dp[i-30] + costs[2] if i-30 >= 0 else costs[2]\n            dp[i] = min(cost1, cost7, cost30)\n\n    return dp[365]\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Convert days list to a set for O(1) lookup\n        day_set = set(days)\n        # Initialize dp array with 0s\n        dp = [0] * 366\n        \n        # Iterate over each day of the year\n        for i in range(1, 366):\n            if i not in day_set:\n                # If it's not a travel day, cost remains the same as the previous day\n                dp[i] = dp[i - 1]\n            else:\n                # Calculate the cost for each type of pass\n                cost1 = dp[i - 1] + costs[0]\n                cost7 = dp[i - 7] + costs[1] if i >= 7 else costs[1]\n                cost30 = dp[i - 30] + costs[2] if i >= 30 else costs[2]\n                # Take the minimum of the three options\n                dp[i] = min(cost1, cost7, cost30)\n        \n        # The answer is the cost to cover all days up to day 365\n        return dp[365]\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the minimum cost using dynamic programming by considering each possible pass option for each travel day.",
