INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.

## Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a prefix sum approach with a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of the number of times a particular prefix sum has occurred. The idea is to iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum (prefix sum). For each element, we check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current running sum, equals `k`. If such a prefix sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We count all such subarrays. We also update the hash map with the current prefix sum.

## Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0
   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle cases where subarray starts from index 0
   Initialize `current_sum` to 0
   Initialize `count` to 0

   For each number `num` in `nums`:
       Add `num` to `current_sum`
       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`
       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:
           Add the count of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`
       Increment the count of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`

   Return `count`
   ```

## Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums
        prefix_sum_count = {0: 1}
        current_sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate over each number in the array
        for num in nums:
            # Update the current prefix sum
            current_sum += num
            
            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k
            needed_sum = current_sum - k
            
            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are
            # subarrays ending at the current index which sum to k
            if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:
                count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]
            
            # Update the prefix_sum_count with the current prefix sum
            if current_sum in prefix_sum_count:
                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1
            else:
                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] = 1
        
        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum equal to k
        return count
```

This solution efficiently finds the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a prefix sum approach with a hash map to track the frequency of prefix sums. This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array.

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given an array of integers and a number `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer technique or sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the number of odd numbers in the current window (subarray) and adjust the window size to maintain exactly `k` odd numbers. We can also use a hashmap to store the count of odd numbers encountered so far, which helps in calculating the number of subarrays ending at a particular index with exactly `k` odd numbers.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Initialize a hashmap `count` with default value 0
           Set `count[0]` to 1 to handle the case when the subarray starts from the beginning
           Initialize `odd_count` to 0 to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered
           Initialize `result` to 0 to store the number of nice subarrays

           For each number `num` in `nums`:
               If `num` is odd, increment `odd_count`
               If `odd_count - k` exists in `count`, add `count[odd_count - k]` to `result`

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. The core concept here is the use of a sliding window or two-pointer technique combined with a hashmap to efficiently track the number of odd numbers encountered in the subarrays.

    The successful strategy involved maintaining a count of odd numbers seen so far using a hashmap. This allowed us to quickly determine how many subarrays end at a given index with exactly `k` odd numbers by checking if `odd_count - k` exists in the hashmap. This approach leverages the prefix sum concept, where the difference between the current count of odd numbers and `k` gives us the number of subarrays with the desired property.

    The solution was implemented with a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient given the constraints. The key insight was recognizing that the problem could be reduced to counting subarrays with a specific difference in the number of odd numbers, which is efficiently handled using a hashmap.

    Overall, this problem reinforced the utility of prefix sums and hashmaps in solving subarray problems, especially when specific conditions (like a fixed number of odd numbers) need to be met.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a prefix sum approach combined with a hashmap. The idea is to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array. For each element, we calculate the cumulative sum and check if there is a previous cumulative sum that, when subtracted from the current cumulative sum, equals `k`. If such a previous sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current index with a sum of `k`. We use a hashmap to store the frequency of each cumulative sum encountered so far, which allows us to efficiently check for the existence of the required previous sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a hashmap `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0
   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle the case when the subarray starts from the beginning
   Initialize `current_sum` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative sum
   Initialize `result` to 0 to store the number of subarrays with sum equal to k

   For each number `num` in `nums`:
       Add `num` to `current_sum`
       If `current_sum - k` exists in `prefix_sum_count`, add `prefix_sum_count[current_sum - k]` to `result`
       Increment `prefix_sum_count[current_sum]` by 1

   Return `result`
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within a given array whose sum equals a specified integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums combined with a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays with the desired sum.

The successful strategy involved maintaining a cumulative sum as we iterate through the array and using a hashmap to store the frequency of each cumulative sum encountered. This allows us to quickly determine if there exists a previous cumulative sum that, when subtracted from the current cumulative sum, equals `k`. If such a sum exists, it indicates the presence of a subarray with the required sum.

The key insight was initializing the hashmap with `{0: 1}` to handle cases where the subarray starts from the beginning of the array. This approach ensures that we account for subarrays that sum to `k` from the start.

The solution was efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, due to the single pass through the array and constant-time operations with the hashmap. This problem reinforced the utility of prefix sums and hashmaps in solving subarray sum problems efficiently.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] The problem of finding the number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals a given integer `k` was effectively solved using a prefix sum approach combined with a hashmap. This method is both time-efficient and space-efficient, operating in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array.

### Key Insights:

1. **Prefix Sum Concept**: The idea of using a prefix sum is crucial. By maintaining a running total of the sum of elements up to the current index, we can determine if a subarray with the desired sum exists by checking if a previous prefix sum, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, equals `k`.

2. **Hashmap for Frequency Counting**: The use of a hashmap to store the frequency of each prefix sum encountered allows for quick lookups. This enables us to efficiently determine how many times a particular prefix sum has occurred, which directly translates to the number of subarrays that sum to `k`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Initializing the hashmap with `{0: 1}` is a clever way to handle cases where a subarray starting from the beginning of the array sums to `k`. This ensures that the calculation correctly accounts for subarrays that start at the first element.

### Reflection:

The official solution aligns closely with the approach I conceptualized and implemented. The use of a hashmap to track prefix sums is a powerful technique for problems involving subarray sums, and this problem serves as a good example of its application. The solution is optimal in terms of both time and space, making it a robust approach for large input sizes. This experience reinforces the importance of prefix sums and hashmaps in solving array-related problems efficiently.

    "scenarios": "This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to find subarrays with a specific sum in an efficient manner. The problem is a classic example of using prefix sums and hashmaps to reduce the time complexity of finding subarrays with a given sum from O(n^2) to O(n). This technique is particularly useful in large datasets where performance is critical, such as in financial data analysis, signal processing, or any application where you need to quickly identify patterns or segments within a sequence of numbers. Understanding this approach can also help in solving similar problems involving subarrays, subsequences, or contiguous segments with specific properties.",

[description]
The function calculates the number of continuous subarrays within a given list of integers that sum up to a specified integer, k. It uses a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of prefix sums encountered as it iterates through the list. For each element in the list, it updates th...,
