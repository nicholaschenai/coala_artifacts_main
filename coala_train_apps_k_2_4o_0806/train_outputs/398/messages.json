Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.\n\n## Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a prefix sum approach with a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of the number of times a particular prefix sum has occurred. The idea is to iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum (prefix sum). For each element, we check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current running sum, equals `k`. If such a prefix sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We count all such subarrays. We also update the hash map with the current prefix sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0\n   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle cases where subarray starts from index 0\n   Initialize `current_sum` to 0\n   Initialize `count` to 0\n\n   For each number `num` in `nums`:\n       Add `num` to `current_sum`\n       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`\n       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:\n           Add the count of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`\n       Increment the count of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`\n\n   Return `count`\n   ```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums\n        prefix_sum_count = {0: 1}\n        current_sum = 0\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each number in the array\n        for num in nums:\n            # Update the current prefix sum\n            current_sum += num\n            \n            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k\n            needed_sum = current_sum - k\n            \n            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are\n            # subarrays ending at the current index which sum to k\n            if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:\n                count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]\n            \n            # Update the prefix_sum_count with the current prefix sum\n            if current_sum in prefix_sum_count:\n                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1\n            else:\n                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] = 1\n        \n        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum equal to k\n        return count\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a prefix sum approach with a hash map to track the frequency of prefix sums. This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array."

This method is both time-efficient and space-efficient, operating in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Prefix Sum Concept**: The idea of using a prefix sum is crucial. By maintaining a running total of the sum of elements up to the current index, we can determine if a subarray with the desired sum exists by checking if a previous prefix sum, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, equals `k`.\n\n2. **Hashmap for Frequency Counting**: The use of a hashmap to store the frequency of each prefix sum encountered allows for quick lookups. This enables us to efficiently determine how many times a particular prefix sum has occurred, which directly translates to the number of subarrays that sum to `k`.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Initializing the hashmap with `{0: 1}` is a clever way to handle cases where a subarray starting from the beginning of the array sums to `k`. This ensures that the calculation correctly accounts for subarrays that start at the first element.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution aligns closely with the approach I conceptualized and implemented. The use of a hashmap to track prefix sums is a powerful technique for problems involving subarray sums, and this problem serves as a good example of its application. The solution is optimal in terms of both time and space, making it a robust approach for large input sizes. This experience reinforces the importance of prefix sums and hashmaps in solving array-related problems efficiently."

It uses a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of prefix sums encountered as it iterates through the list. For each element in the list, it updates the current cumulative sum and checks if there exists a prefix sum such that the difference between the current sum and this prefix sum equals k. If such a prefix sum is found, its frequency is added to the result count. The function then updates the hashmap with the current cumulative sum before moving to the next element. Finally, it returns the total count of subarrays whose sum equals k.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to find subarrays with a specific sum in an efficient manner. The problem is a classic example of using prefix sums and hashmaps to reduce the time complexity of finding subarrays with a given sum from O(n^2) to O(n). This technique is particularly useful in large datasets where performance is critical, such as in financial data analysis, signal processing, or any application where you need to quickly identify patterns or segments within a sequence of numbers. Understanding this approach can also help in solving similar problems involving subarrays, subsequences, or contiguous segments with specific properties."
