## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1

1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If any two beds are adjacent in any of these directions, the arrangement is "UNSAFE". We need to perform this check for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each test case, read the grid dimensions \( N \) and the grid itself.
2. For each cell in the grid that contains a bed (value 1), check its adjacent cells in all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).
3. If any adjacent cell also contains a bed, mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE" and break out of the loop for that test case.
4. If no adjacent beds are found for any bed in the grid, mark the arrangement as "SAFE".
5. Repeat the above steps for all test cases and output the result for each.

## Pseudocode

```
function check_safety(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (di, dj) in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)]:
                ni = i + di
                nj = j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read grid of size N x N
        result = check_safety(grid, N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_safety(grid, N):
    # Directions for adjacent cells: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all adjacent cells
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = check_safety(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the bed arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", and outputs the result for each test case. The `check_safety` function checks all possible adjacent positions for each bed to ensure no two beds are adjacent.

    ### Summary of Attempts on the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring no two consecutive days have the same dish, and the first and last days are different. The key pattern is recognizing that for `N` days, the number of valid schedules can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the choices of dishes on the first, middle, and last days.

    #### Strategy and Formula
    Initially, the formula used was incorrect for `N > 3`. The correct approach is:
    - For `N = 2`, the result is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).
    - For `N = 3`, the result is \(4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24\).
    - For `N > 3`, the result should be \(4 \times 3^{N-2} \times 2\).

    This formula accounts for:
    - 4 choices for the first day.
    - \(3^{N-2}\) choices for the middle days, ensuring no consecutive days are the same.
    - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it's different from the first day.

    #### Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the formula for `N > 3`, where the last multiplier was incorrectly set. The correct multiplier should ensure the first and last days are different, which is achieved by multiplying by 2, not 3. The misunderstanding of the expected output for `N = 5` was corrected by applying the correct formula, which results in 240, not 216.

    #### Final Code Snippet
    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            if N == 2:
                result = 12
            else:
                result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD
            results.append(result)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        results = calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly understanding the constraints and requirements of the problem, especially when dealing with large values of `N`.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of distributing tiles to completely tile rooms in two houses, the core concept was recognizing that only perfect square numbers of tiles can be evenly split to tile two rooms of the same size. This insight led to the realization that for each test case, the solution involves finding the largest integer `k` such that `k*k <= N`, where `N` is the number of boxes.

    Initially, the solution failed due to incorrect input handling and function execution. The input was read inside a function that was never called, resulting in no output. The fix involved moving the input reading outside the function and ensuring the function was executed by placing it within a `main` function, which was then called in the standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This approach ensures the script runs correctly when executed directly.

    The use of `math.isqrt(N)` was a key improvement, providing an efficient and precise way to compute the integer square root, which is crucial for determining the number of rooms that can be completely tiled. This experience reinforced the importance of proper input/output handling in competitive programming and the utility of mathematical functions for efficient computation.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each test case, iterate over each cell in the grid. If a cell contains a bed (1), check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and all four diagonals) to ensure none of them also contain a bed.

3. **Output**: If any adjacent cells contain beds, mark the test case as "UNSAFE". If all beds are placed safely, mark it as "SAFE".

## Pseudocode

### Explanation

- **is_safe Function**: This function checks each cell in the grid. If a cell contains a bed, it checks all possible adjacent cells (including diagonals) to ensure they do not contain a bed. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, it returns "UNSAFE".
  
- **main Function**: This function handles input and output. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints whether the arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each test case, iterate over each cell in the grid. If a cell contains a bed (1), check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and all four diagonals) to ensure none of them also contain a bed.

3. **Output**: If any adjacent cells contain beds, mark the test case as "UNSAFE". If all beds are placed safely, mark it as "SAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:

                ni = i + dx
                nj = j + dy
                if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The solution should check each bed and ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.

### Solution Analysis

The solution involves:
1. Iterating over each cell in the grid.
2. If a cell contains a bed (1), checking all adjacent cells (including diagonals) to ensure they do not contain a bed.
3. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, the grid is marked "UNSAFE".
4. If no adjacent beds are found for any bed, the grid is marked "SAFE".

### Error Identification

Upon reviewing the solution, the logic for checking adjacent cells seems correct. However, the issue might be in the interpretation of the problem statement or the implementation details. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and the solution:

1. **Diagonal Safety**: The problem states that beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe. This means that diagonal adjacency is allowed, which contradicts the initial understanding. The solution should only check horizontal and vertical adjacency, not diagonal.

2. **Implementation**: The current implementation checks all eight possible directions (including diagonals), which is incorrect based on the problem's clarification.

### Corrected Solution

We need to adjust the solution to only check horizontal and vertical adjacency, not diagonal. Let's update the code accordingly:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for adjacent cells (right, down, left, up)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            grid.append(row)
            index += N
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Direction Adjustment**: The `directions` list now only includes horizontal and vertical directions: right, down, left, and up. This change ensures that diagonal adjacency is not checked, aligning with the problem's requirement that diagonal adjacency is safe.

This should resolve the issue and correctly determine if the grid is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on the problem's constraints.

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0).

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each test case, iterate over each cell in the grid. If a cell contains a bed (1), check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and all four diagonals) to ensure none of them also contain a bed.

### Explanation

- **is_safe Function**: This function checks each cell in the grid. If a cell contains a bed, it checks all possible adjacent cells (including diagonals) to ensure they do not contain a bed. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, it returns "UNSAFE".
  
- **main Function**: This function handles input and output. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints whether the arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The solution should check each bed and ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.

### Solution Analysis

The solution involves:
1. Iterating over each cell in the grid.
2. If a cell contains a bed (1), checking all adjacent cells (including diagonals) to ensure they do not contain a bed.
3. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, the grid is marked "UNSAFE".
4. If no adjacent beds are found for any bed, the grid is marked "SAFE".

### Error Identification

Upon reviewing the solution, the logic for checking adjacent cells seems correct. However, the issue might be in the interpretation of the problem statement or the implementation details. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and the solution:

1. **Diagonal Safety**: The problem states that beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe. This means that diagonal adjacency is allowed, which contradicts the initial understanding. The solution should only check horizontal and vertical adjacency, not diagonal.

2. **Implementation**: The current implementation checks all eight possible directions (including diagonals), which is incorrect based on the problem's clarification.

### Corrected Solution

We need to adjust the solution to only check horizontal and vertical adjacency, not diagonal. Let's update the code accordingly:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for adjacent cells (right, down, left, up)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            grid.append(row)
            index += N
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Direction Adjustment**: The `directions` list now only includes horizontal and vertical directions: right, down, left, and up. This change ensures that diagonal adjacency is not checked, aligning with the problem's requirement that diagonal adjacency is safe.

This should resolve the issue and correctly determine if the grid is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on the problem's constraints.

    ### Summary of Attempts on the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring no two consecutive days have the same dish, and the first and last days are different. The key pattern is recognizing that for `N` days, the number of valid schedules can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the choices of dishes on the first, middle, and last days.

    #### Strategy and Formula
    Initially, the formula used was incorrect for `N > 3`. The correct approach is:
    - For `N = 2`, the result is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).
    - For `N = 3`, the result is \(4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24\).
    - For `N > 3`, the result should be \(4 \times 3^{N-2} \times 2\).

    This formula accounts for:
    - 4 choices for the first day.
    - \(3^{N-2}\) choices for the middle days, ensuring no consecutive days are the same.
    - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it's different from the first day.

    #### Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the formula for `N > 3`, where the last multiplier was incorrectly set. The correct multiplier should ensure the first and last days are different, which is achieved by multiplying by 2, not 3. The misunderstanding of the expected output for `N = 5` was corrected by applying the correct formula, which results in 240, not 216.

    #### Final Code Snippet
    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            if N == 2:
                result = 12
            else:
                result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD
            results.append(result)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        results = calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly understanding the constraints and requirements of the problem, especially when dealing with large values of `N`.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of distributing tiles to completely tile rooms in two houses, the core concept was recognizing that only perfect square numbers of tiles can be evenly split to tile two rooms of the same size. This insight led to the realization that for each test case, the solution involves finding the largest integer `k` such that `k*k <= N`, where `N` is the number of boxes.

    Initially, the solution failed due to incorrect input handling and function execution. The input was read inside a function that was never called, resulting in no output. The fix involved moving the input reading outside the function and ensuring the function was executed by placing it within a `main` function, which was then called in the standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This approach ensures the script runs correctly when executed directly.

    The use of `math.isqrt(N)` was a key improvement, providing an efficient and precise way to compute the integer square root, which is crucial for determining the number of rooms that can be completely tiled. This experience reinforced the importance of proper input/output handling in competitive programming and the utility of mathematical functions for efficient computation.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each test case, iterate over each cell in the grid. If a cell contains a bed (1), check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and all four diagonals) to ensure none of them also contain a bed.

3. **Output**: If any adjacent cells contain beds, mark the test case as "UNSAFE". If all beds are placed safely, mark it as "SAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (dx, dy) in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]:
                ni = i + dx
                nj = j + dy
                if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

        read N
        read grid of size N x N
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

### Explanation

- **is_safe Function**: This function checks each cell in the grid. If a cell contains a bed, it checks all possible adjacent cells (including diagonals) to ensure they do not contain a bed. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, it returns "UNSAFE".
  
- **main Function**: This function handles input and output. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints whether the arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The solution should check each bed and ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.

### Solution Analysis

The solution involves:
1. Iterating over each cell in the grid.
2. If a cell contains a bed (1), checking all adjacent cells (including diagonals) to ensure they do not contain a bed.
3. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, the grid is marked "UNSAFE".
4. If no adjacent beds are found for any bed, the grid is marked "SAFE".

### Error Identification

Upon reviewing the solution, the logic for checking adjacent cells seems correct. However, the issue might be in the interpretation of the problem statement or the implementation details. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and the solution:

1. **Diagonal Safety**: The problem states that beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe. This means that diagonal adjacency is allowed, which contradicts the initial understanding. The solution should only check horizontal and vertical adjacency, not diagonal.

2. **Implementation**: The current implementation checks all eight possible directions (including diagonals), which is incorrect based on the problem's clarification.

### Corrected Solution

We need to adjust the solution to only check horizontal and vertical adjacency, not diagonal. Let's update the code accordingly:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for adjacent cells (right, down, left, up)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            grid.append(row)
            index += N
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Direction Adjustment**: The `directions` list now only includes horizontal and vertical directions: right, down, left, and up. This change ensures that diagonal adjacency is not checked, aligning with the problem's requirement that diagonal adjacency is safe.

This should resolve the issue and correctly determine if the grid is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on the problem's constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on adjacency rules. The key insight was understanding that diagonal adjacency is allowed, which initially led to an incorrect solution when I checked for all eight possible directions (including diagonals).

### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem tests for understanding of grid traversal and adjacency checks. It requires careful reading of the problem statement to correctly interpret the rules regarding adjacency.

### Strategies and Fixes
Initially, I checked all eight directions for adjacency, which was incorrect because diagonal adjacency is allowed. The correct strategy was to only check horizontal and vertical directions (right, down, left, up) for adjacency. This adjustment aligned the solution with the problem's requirements and resolved the issue.

### Code Snippet
The final solution involved iterating over each cell in the grid and checking only the four cardinal directions for adjacent beds:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"
```

This experience reinforced the importance of accurately interpreting problem constraints and adjusting the solution approach accordingly.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each test case, iterate over each cell in the grid. If a cell contains a bed (1), check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and all four diagonals) to ensure none of them also contain a bed.

3. **Output**: If any adjacent cells contain beds, mark the test case as "UNSAFE". If all beds are placed safely, mark it as "SAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (dx, dy) in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]:
                ni = i + dx
                nj = j + dy
                if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read grid of size N x N
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for adjacent cells (right, down, left, up, and four diagonals)

The problem requires us to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The solution should check each bed and ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.

The solution involves:

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem required checking the safety of bed arrangements in a grid, ensuring no two beds are adjacent horizontally or vertically. Initially, I misunderstood the problem by including diagonal checks, which was unnecessary since diagonal adjacency is allowed.

#### Key Insights:

1. **Understanding Adjacency**: The main insight was realizing that only horizontal and vertical adjacency needed to be checked, not diagonal. This simplified the problem significantly.

2. **Efficient Checking**: The official solution efficiently checks for unsafe conditions by iterating through rows and columns separately. This approach is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.

3. **Flag Usage**: The use of a flag to break out of loops once an unsafe condition is found is a practical way to optimize the solution, preventing further unnecessary checks.

#### Code Snippet:

The official solution uses a simple nested loop structure to check for unsafe conditions:

```python
for i in lst:
    for j in range(n-1):
        if i[j] == i[j+1] == 1:
            res.append("UNSAFE")
            flag = 1
            break
    if flag != 0:

This snippet efficiently checks for horizontal and vertical adjacency, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.

### Conclusion

The experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and focusing on the most relevant checks. The official solution's simplicity and efficiency serve as a good reminder to avoid overcomplicating problems by sticking to the core requirements.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the task was to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on adjacency rules. The key insight was understanding that diagonal adjacency is allowed, which initially led to an incorrect solution when I checked for all eight possible directions (including diagonals).

INFO - Updated entry: ### Reflection

The problem required checking the safety of bed arrangements in a grid, ensuring no two beds are adjacent horizontally or vertically. Initially, I misunderstood the problem by including diagonal checks, which was unnecessary since diagonal adjacency is allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer N and then an N x N grid of integers. It checks each grid using another function to determine if any adjacent cells both contain the value 1, indicating an "UNSAFE" condition. It collects the results for each test case, either "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", and prints them. The function handles multiple test cases in a single run.

[Problem]
    Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
    The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
    The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
    This is a SAFE example:
    1 0
    0 1
    This is an UNSAFE example:
    0 1 1
    0 0 0
    1 0 0
    To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
    Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Next line contains $N$.
    - Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
    - $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
    - $2 \leq N \leq 100$

    -----Subtasks-----
    - 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
    - 70 points : Original constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    4
    1 0 1 0
    0 0 0 1
    0 1 0 0
    1 0 0 1
    4
    1 0 1 0
    0 0 0 0
    1 0 1 1
    0 1 0 0

    -----Sample Output:-----
    SAFE
    UNSAFE

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.
