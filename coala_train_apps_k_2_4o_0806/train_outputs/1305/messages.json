The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.\nThe area is of dimension $N$ x $N$\nThe whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.\nThis is a SAFE example:\n1 0\n0 1\nThis is an UNSAFE example:\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nTo avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.\nReturn an output of \"SAFE\" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return \"UNSAFE\" otherwise.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Next line contains $N$.\n- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as \"UNSAFE\".\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n- $0 \\leq Ai \\leq 1$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 100$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- 30 points : $1 \\leq N \\leq 7$\n- 70 points : Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n4\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n4\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\nSAFE\nUNSAFE\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nBeds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

If any two beds are adjacent in any of these directions, the arrangement is \"UNSAFE\". We need to perform this check for multiple test cases.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. For each test case, read the grid dimensions \\( N \\) and the grid itself.\n2. For each cell in the grid that contains a bed (value 1), check its adjacent cells in all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).\n3. If any adjacent cell also contains a bed, mark the arrangement as \"UNSAFE\" and break out of the loop for that test case.\n4. If no adjacent beds are found for any bed in the grid, mark the arrangement as \"SAFE\".\n5.

        "content": "Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\nThe problem requires us to determine if a grid of beds is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\". A grid is \"SAFE\" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The solution should check each bed and ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.\n\n### Solution Analysis\n\nThe solution involves:\n1. Iterating over each cell in the grid.\n2. If a cell contains a bed (1), checking all adjacent cells (including diagonals) to ensure they do not contain a bed.\n3. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, the grid is marked \"UNSAFE\".\n4. If no adjacent beds are found for any bed, the grid is marked \"SAFE\".\n\n### Error Identification\n\nUpon reviewing the solution, the logic for checking adjacent cells seems correct. However, the issue might be in the interpretation of the problem statement or the implementation details. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and the solution:\n\n1. **Diagonal Safety**: The problem states that beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe. This means that diagonal adjacency is allowed, which contradicts the initial understanding. The solution should only check horizontal and vertical adjacency, not diagonal.\n\n2. **Implementation**: The current implementation checks all eight possible directions (including diagonals), which is incorrect based on the problem's clarification.\n\n### Corrected Solution\n\nWe need to adjust the solution to only check horizontal and vertical adjacency, not diagonal. Let's update the code accordingly:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(grid, N):\n    # Directions for adjacent cells (right, down, left, up)\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n    \n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                for dx, dy in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:\n                        return \"UNSAFE\"\n    return \"SAFE\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(N):\n            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            grid.append(row)\n            index += N\n        result = is_safe(grid, N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Direction Adjustment**: The `directions` list now only includes horizontal and vertical directions: right, down, left, and up. This change ensures that diagonal adjacency is not checked, aligning with the problem's requirement that diagonal adjacency is safe.\n\nThis should resolve the issue and correctly determine if the grid is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\" based on the problem's constraints."

We will adjust the code to only check horizontal and vertical adjacency.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(grid, N):\n    # Directions for adjacent cells (right, down, left, up)\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n    \n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                for dx, dy in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:\n                        return \"UNSAFE\"\n    return \"SAFE\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(N):\n            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            grid.append(row)\n            index += N\n        result = is_safe(grid, N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Direction Adjustment**: The `directions` list now only includes horizontal and vertical directions: right, down, left, and up. This ensures that diagonal adjacency is not checked, which aligns with the problem's requirement that diagonal adjacency is safe.\n\nThis should correctly determine if the grid is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\" based on the problem's constraints."

        "content": "In this problem, the task was to determine if a grid of beds is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\" based on adjacency rules. The key insight was understanding that diagonal adjacency is allowed, which initially led to an incorrect solution when I checked for all eight possible directions (including diagonals).\n\n### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem tests for understanding of grid traversal and adjacency checks. It requires careful reading of the problem statement to correctly interpret the rules regarding adjacency.\n\n### Strategies and Fixes\nInitially, I checked all eight directions for adjacency, which was incorrect because diagonal adjacency is allowed. The correct strategy was to only check horizontal and vertical directions (right, down, left, up) for adjacency. This adjustment aligned the solution with the problem's requirements and resolved the issue.\n\n### Code Snippet\nThe final solution involved iterating over each cell in the grid and checking only the four cardinal directions for adjacent beds:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(grid, N):\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                for dx, dy in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:\n                        return \"UNSAFE\"\n    return \"SAFE\"\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of accurately interpreting problem constraints and adjusting the solution approach accordingly."

        "content": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem required checking the safety of bed arrangements in a grid, ensuring no two beds are adjacent horizontally or vertically. Initially, I misunderstood the problem by including diagonal checks, which was unnecessary since diagonal adjacency is allowed.\n\n#### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Understanding Adjacency**: The main insight was realizing that only horizontal and vertical adjacency needed to be checked, not diagonal. This simplified the problem significantly.\n\n2. **Efficient Checking**: The official solution efficiently checks for unsafe conditions by iterating through rows and columns separately. This approach is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.\n\n3. **Flag Usage**: The use of a flag to break out of loops once an unsafe condition is found is a practical way to optimize the solution, preventing further unnecessary checks.\n\n#### Code Snippet:\n\nThe official solution uses a simple nested loop structure to check for unsafe conditions:\n\n```python\nfor i in lst:\n    for j in range(n-1):\n        if i[j] == i[j+1] == 1:\n            res.append(\"UNSAFE\")\n            flag = 1\n            break\n    if flag != 0:\n        break\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if lst[i][j] == lst[i+1][j] == 1:\n            res.append(\"UNSAFE\")\n            flag = 1\n            break\n    if flag != 0:\n        break\n```\n\nThis snippet efficiently checks for horizontal and vertical adjacency, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and focusing on the most relevant checks. The official solution's simplicity and efficiency serve as a good reminder to avoid overcomplicating problems by sticking to the core requirements."

For each test case, it reads an integer N and then an N x N grid of integers. It checks each grid using another function to determine if any adjacent cells both contain the value 1, indicating an \"UNSAFE\" condition. It collects the results for each test case, either \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\", and prints them. The function handles multiple test cases in a single run.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where spatial arrangement and safety protocols are critical, such as in hospital management during pandemics, seating arrangements in public spaces, or any situation where maintaining a safe distance between entities is necessary. The problem addresses the need to ensure that no two beds (or entities) are adjacent, except diagonally, which can be applied to various grid-based planning problems. Understanding how to check adjacency in a grid and ensuring compliance with safety regulations can be applied to software development for health management systems, urban planning, and even game development where grid-based logic is used."
