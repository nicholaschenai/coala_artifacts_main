Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string that is encoded using a specific format: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a substring that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such encoded patterns. The input string is guaranteed to be valid, meaning it will not contain any malformed brackets or unexpected characters.

## Conceptual Solution

To decode the string, we need to process it character by character. We can use a stack to help manage nested encoded patterns. Here's the plan:

1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and numbers.
2. Iterate over each character in the string:
   - If the character is a digit, build the complete number (since numbers can have multiple digits).
   - If the character is `[`, push the current number and the current string onto the stack, then reset them.
   - If the character is `]`, pop from the stack to get the last string and the number, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last string.
   - If the character is a letter, append it to the current string.
3. At the end of the iteration, the current string will contain the fully decoded string.

## Pseudocode

```
function decodeString(s):
    stack = []
    current_string = ""
    current_number = 0

    for each character in s:
        if character is a digit:
            update current_number
        else if character is '[':
            push (current_string, current_number) to stack
            reset current_string to ""
            reset current_number to 0
        else if character is ']':
            pop (last_string, number) from stack
            current_string = last_string + (current_string repeated number times)
        else:
            append character to current_string

    return current_string
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and numbers
        stack = []
        current_string = ""
        current_number = 0

        # Iterate over each character in the input string
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # If the character is a digit, update the current number
                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                # If the character is '[', push the current string and number onto the stack
                stack.append((current_string, current_number))
                # Reset the current string and number
                current_string = ""
                current_number = 0
            elif char == ']':
                # If the character is ']', pop from the stack
                last_string, number = stack.pop()
                # Repeat the current string 'number' times and append to the last string
                current_string = last_string + current_string * number
            else:
                # If the character is a letter, append it to the current string
                current_string += char

        # Return the fully decoded string
        return current_string
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key concept was understanding how binary numbers can be read upside down and how this affects the rearrangement of a string. The problem required converting indices to binary, reversing the binary string to simulate upside-down reading, and then converting it back to a decimal to determine the new position of each character in the string.

    The main challenge was ensuring the binary numbers were correctly padded to `k` bits and reversed accurately. The solution involved using Python's string formatting to handle binary conversion and reversal efficiently. The approach of using a list to store rearranged characters based on the new indices was straightforward and effective.

    The problem reinforced the importance of understanding binary operations and string manipulations, which are common in algorithmic challenges. The solution was implemented successfully without any unexpected errors, demonstrating the robustness of the approach. This problem serves as a good exercise in bit manipulation and string indexing, which are useful skills in competitive programming and technical interviews.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to generate a specific pattern based on an integer \( K \) for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of \( K \) lines. Each line \( i \) (where \( i \) ranges from 0 to \( K-1 \)) contains numbers starting from \( i \) down to 0, followed by numbers from 1 up to \( i \). The task is to output this pattern for each test case.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Input Handling**: First, read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the integer \( K \).

        2. **Pattern Generation**:
           - For each test case, generate \( K \) lines.
           - For each line \( i \) (from 0 to \( K-1 \)):
             - Create a sequence starting from \( i \) down to 0.
             - Append a sequence from 1 up to \( i \).
           - This results in a line that starts with a descending sequence and ends with an ascending sequence.

        3. **Output**: Print the generated pattern for each test case.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function generate_pattern(K):
            for i from 0 to K-1:
                line = []
                for j from i down to 0:
                    append j to line
                for j from 1 to i:
                    append j to line
                print line as a string

        function main():
            read T
            for each test case:
                read K
                generate_pattern(K)
        ```

        ### Final Python Code

        ```python
        def generate_pattern(K):
            for i in range(K):
                line = []
                # Descending part
                for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                    line.append(str(j))
                # Ascending part
                for j in range(1, i + 1):
                    line.append(str(j))
                # Print the line as a string
                print("".join(line))

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().strip().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            index = 1
            for _ in range(T):
                K = int(data[index])
                index += 1
                generate_pattern(K)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **generate_pattern(K)**: This function generates and prints the pattern for a given \( K \). It constructs each line by first appending numbers in descending order from \( i \) to 0, and then in ascending order from 1 to \( i \).

        - **main()**: This function handles input and output. It reads all input at once, splits it into manageable parts, and processes each test case by calling `generate_pattern(K)` for each \( K \). The results are printed directly to standard output.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given an encoded string that follows a specific pattern: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a string that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Stack Utilization**: Use a stack to help manage nested patterns. The stack will store characters and numbers as we parse through the string.

2. **Parsing the String**:
   - Traverse the string character by character.
   - If a digit is encountered, determine the full number (which could be more than one digit).
   - If an opening bracket `[` is encountered, push the current number and the current string onto the stack and reset them.
   - If a closing bracket `]` is encountered, pop from the stack to get the last string and the number of repetitions, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last string.
   - If a character is encountered, append it to the current string.

3. **Final Output**: After processing the entire string, the stack should be empty, and the current string will be the fully decoded string.

### Pseudocode

```
function decodeString(s):
    stack = []
    current_string = ""
    current_number = 0

    for each character in s:
        if character is a digit:
            update current_number

            reset current_string and current_number
        else if character is ']':
            pop (last_string, repeat_count) from stack
            current_string = last_string + (current_string repeated repeat_count times)
        else:
            append character to current_string

    return current_string
```

                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                stack.append((current_string, current_number))
                current_string = ""

            else:
                current_string += char
        
        return current_string
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Stack**: Used to keep track of the strings and numbers before encountering a `[` and to manage nested patterns.
- **current_string**: Holds the current segment of the string being processed.
- **current_number**: Accumulates digits to form the full number before a `[` is encountered.
- **Loop**: Iterates over each character in the string, updating `current_string` and `current_number` as needed, and using the stack to handle nested patterns.
- **Return**: The fully decoded string after processing all characters.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given an encoded string that follows a specific pattern: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a string that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Stack Utilization**: Use a stack to help manage nested patterns. The stack will store characters and numbers as we parse through the string.

2. **Parsing the String**:
   - Traverse the string character by character.
   - If a digit is encountered, determine the full number (which could be more than one digit).
   - If an opening bracket `[` is encountered, push the current number and the current string onto the stack and reset them.
   - If a closing bracket `]` is encountered, pop from the stack to get the last string and the number of repetitions, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last string.
   - If a character is encountered, append it to the current string.

3. **Final Output**: After processing the entire string, the stack should be empty, and the current string will be the fully decoded string.

### Pseudocode

```
function decodeString(s):
    stack = []
    current_string = ""
    current_number = 0

    for each character in s:
        if character is a digit:
            update current_number
        else if character is '[':
            push (current_string, current_number) onto stack
            reset current_string and current_number
        else if character is ']':
            pop (last_string, repeat_count) from stack
            current_string = last_string + (current_string repeated repeat_count times)
        else:
            append character to current_string

    return current_string
```

    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to decode a string that follows a specific pattern of `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The challenge was to handle nested patterns and ensure that the decoding process correctly expanded all such patterns.

The successful strategy involved using a stack to manage the nested structure of the encoded string. The stack was used to store the current string and the number of repetitions whenever an opening bracket `[` was encountered. This allowed for easy retrieval and concatenation when a closing bracket `]` was encountered, effectively handling nested patterns.

Key steps included:
- Parsing the string character by character.
- Accumulating digits to form the full number before a `[` is encountered.
- Using the stack to save the state of the current string and number when entering a new nested level.
- Popping from the stack to retrieve and concatenate the repeated string when exiting a nested level.

The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging the stack to manage the complexity of nested patterns. This method ensured that the solution was both clear and scalable for more complex inputs. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness and robustness.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] The problem of decoding a string encoded with the pattern `k[encoded_string]` was approached using a stack-based method, both in my solution and the official solution. Here are some insights and comparisons:

1. **Stack Utilization**: Both solutions effectively use a stack to manage nested patterns. The stack helps in storing the current string and the number of repetitions when encountering a `[` and retrieving them when encountering a `]`.

2. **Handling Numbers**: In my solution, I used a single integer `current_number` to accumulate digits, while the official solution uses a string `num` to build the number. Both methods are valid, but using a string can be more intuitive when dealing with multiple digits.

3. **Stack Initialization**: The official solution initializes the stack with a base element `["", 1]`, which simplifies the handling of the final result. This ensures that the stack always has at least one element, which can be useful to avoid edge cases where the stack might be empty.

4. **Appending to the Current String**: In the official solution, the current string is always the last element in the stack, which is updated directly. This is a slight optimization over my approach, where I used a separate `current_string` variable.

5. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient and operate in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string. This is because each character in the string is processed exactly once.

Overall, the official solution is slightly more concise and elegant, particularly in how it initializes the stack and handles the current string directly within the stack. This approach reduces the need for additional variables and simplifies the logic for appending characters and repeating strings.

    "scenarios": "This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to decode strings that are encoded using a specific pattern involving repetition. This is common in data compression, where repeated patterns are stored in a compact form to save space. Understanding this pattern can also be useful in parsing and interpreting data formats that use similar encoding rules, such as certain markup languages or configuration files. Additionally, this problem is a good exercise in understanding and implementing stack data structures, which are often used to handle nested or hierarchical data. The solution demonstrates how to manage nested structures and repeat sequences efficiently, which is a common requirement in programming tasks involving parsing or interpreting complex data formats.",

[description]
The function takes an encoded string as input and decodes it by processing characters sequentially. It uses a stack to handle nested patterns, where each pattern is of the form "k[encoded_string]". When a digit is encountered, it updates the current number, and when an opening brac...,
