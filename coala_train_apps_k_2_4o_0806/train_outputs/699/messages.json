Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \\leq i \\leq N$.    \nA Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.\nGiven these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.\n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$ respectively. \n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^2$\n- $1 \\le K \\le 10^9$ \n- $1 \\le D \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le A_i \\le 10^7$ for each valid $i$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (40 points):\n- $N = 1$\n- $1 \\le A_1 \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n5\n1 5 31\n4\n1 10 3\n23\n2 5 7\n20 36\n2 5 10\n19 2\n3 3 300\n1 1 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n0\n2\n7\n4\n1\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- \nExample case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.\n- \nExample case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.\n- \nExample case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nChef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan contests for the next `D` days, but he can host at most one contest per day. The task is to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host given these constraints.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.\n2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.\n3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.\n4. **Output the Result**: For each test case, output the maximum number of contests that can be hosted.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfor each test case:\n    read N, K, D\n    read the list of problems created by each setter\n    total_problems = sum of all problems\n    max_contests = total_problems // K\n    result = min(max_contests, D)\n    print result\n```\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_division_3_contests():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        D = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        problems = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        \n        total_problems = sum(problems)\n        max_contests = total_problems // K\n        results.append(min(max_contests, D))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, we extract the number of setters `N`, the number of problems needed per contest `K`, and the number of days `D`.\n- **Calculate Total Problems**: We sum up the problems from all setters.\n- **Determine Maximum Contests**: We calculate how many contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by `K`.\n- **Limit by Days**: We take the minimum of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days `D`.\n- **Output**: We store the result for each test case and print them at the end."

This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called, which is a common issue when the function is defined but not executed. In competitive programming or script-based environments, the main function or logic should be executed directly to ensure the program runs as expected.\n\n        ### Steps to Fix the Code\n\n        1. **Ensure Execution**: The `solve()` function should be called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed when the script runs.\n\n        2. **Check Input/Output**: Ensure that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()` which is appropriate for reading all input at once in a competitive programming environment.\n\n        3. **Verify Logic**: The logic for calculating the LCM and determining the number of times all groups are on campus together seems correct, but we should ensure that the function is executed to see the results.\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n\n        def lcm(a, b):\n            return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\n        def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n                index += 3\n        \n                # Calculate LCM of x, y, z\n                lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        \n                # Calculate total hours in N days\n                total_hours = 24 * N\n        \n                # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together\n                count = total_hours // lcm_xyz\n        \n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Changes\n\n        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure that the function is executed when the script runs.\n        - **Input/Output Handling**: The input and output handling remains the same, using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and `print()` to output results.\n\n        This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function will now be executed and produce the expected results.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n\n        def lcm(a, b):\n            return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\n        def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n                index += 3\n        \n                # Calculate LCM of x, y, z\n                lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        \n                # Calculate total hours in N days\n                total_hours = 24 * N\n        \n                # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together\n                count = total_hours // lcm_xyz\n        \n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '10', '8 10 6'] Output: 2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.\n        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.\n        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.\n\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        -

Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: \n           - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.\n           - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.\n\n        2. **Constraints**:\n           - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.\n           - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.\n\n        3. **Combinatorial Approach**:\n           - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:\n             - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.\n             - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.\n           - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.\n           - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.\n\n        4. **Modulo Operation**:\n           - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10^9 + 7\n            precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N\n\n            results = []\n            for each query (I, K):\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD\n                    count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        function precompute_factorials(N):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i from 2 to N:\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i from N-1 down to 1:\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        function C(n, k):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n            # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n            factorials, inverse_factorials = precompute_factorials(N, MOD)\n    \n            results = []\n            for I, K in queries:\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD)\n                    count_greater = pow(2, N-I, MOD)\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        def precompute_factorials(N, MOD):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i in range(2, N+1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i in range(N-1, 0, -1):\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        def C(n, k, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                queries = []\n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n                    queries.append((I, K))\n        \n                results.extend(calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries))\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently calculates the number of subsets for each query by precomputing factorials and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '3 3', '1 2', '2 1', '3 2'] Output: 0\n        2\n        2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

The key steps involved calculating the total number of problems available, determining the maximum possible contests based on the number of problems required per contest, and then considering the constraint of the number of days available to host these contests.\n\nThe strategy that worked was straightforward: first, sum up all the problems from the setters to get the total number of problems. Then, calculate how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`). Finally, the actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of this number and the number of days (`D`), since only one contest can be hosted per day.\n\nThe problem was relatively simple, and the solution was implemented efficiently by iterating over each test case, performing the calculations, and storing the results. The solution passed all test cases without any issues, indicating that the approach was correct and the implementation was robust. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and efficiently using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems."

The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of problems and a limit on the number of days.\n\nKey insights from the problem-solving process:\n\n1. **Total Problems Calculation**: Both solutions start by calculating the total number of problems available by summing up the problems created by each setter. This is a crucial step as it determines the potential number of contests that can be hosted.\n\n2. **Maximum Contests Calculation**: The next step is to calculate the maximum number of contests that can be hosted by dividing the total number of problems by `K`, the number of problems required per contest. This gives the theoretical maximum number of contests.\n\n3. **Day Constraint**: The final step is to consider the constraint on the number of days (`D`). The actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of the theoretical maximum contests and `D`.\n\nThe official solution is concise and directly implements these steps in a few lines of code. It uses Python's built-in functions to read input, calculate the necessary values, and output the result efficiently. The use of `min(P, D)` succinctly handles the day constraint, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.\n\nOverall, this problem reinforces the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and using simple arithmetic operations to derive the solution.

It processes each test case to determine the maximum number of contests that can be held, given the constraints of the total number of problems available and the number of days. It calculates the total number of problems for each test case and determines the maximum possible contests by dividing this total by the number of problems required per contest. The result for each test case is the minimum between this calculated maximum and the number of days available. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where there is a need to allocate limited resources over a fixed period, ensuring that constraints are met. For example, in event planning where each event requires a certain number of resources, and there is a limit on how many events can be held in a given timeframe. It is also applicable in project management, where tasks require a certain number of resources, and there is a deadline for completion. The solution involves calculating the total available resources, determining how many complete sets of resources can be formed, and then limiting the number of events or tasks by the maximum allowed within the given period."
