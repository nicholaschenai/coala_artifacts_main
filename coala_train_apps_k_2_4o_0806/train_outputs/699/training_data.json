    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints on the number of problems and days. The key steps involved calculating the total number of problems available, determining the maximum possible contests based on the number of problems required per contest, and then considering the constraint of the number of days available to host these contests.\n\nThe strategy that worked was straightforward: first, sum up all the problems from the setters to get the total number of problems. Then, calculate how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`). Finally, the actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of this number and the number of days (`D`), since only one contest can be hosted per day.\n\nThe problem was relatively simple, and the solution was implemented efficiently by iterating over each test case, performing the calculations, and storing the results. The solution passed all test cases without any issues, indicating that the approach was correct and the implementation was robust. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and efficiently using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is straightforward given the problem constraints. The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of problems and a limit on the number of days.\n\nKey insights from the problem-solving process:\n\n1. **Total Problems Calculation**: Both solutions start by calculating the total number of problems available by summing up the problems created by each setter. This is a crucial step as it determines the potential number of contests that can be hosted.\n\n2. **Maximum Contests Calculation**: The next step is to calculate the maximum number of contests that can be hosted by dividing the total number of problems by `K`, the number of problems required per contest. This gives the theoretical maximum number of contests.\n\n3. **Day Constraint**: The final step is to consider the constraint on the number of days (`D`). The actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of the theoretical maximum contests and `D`.\n\nThe official solution is concise and directly implements these steps in a few lines of code. It uses Python's built-in functions to read input, calculate the necessary values, and output the result efficiently. The use of `min(P, D)` succinctly handles the day constraint, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.\n\nOverall, this problem reinforces the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and using simple arithmetic operations to derive the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes multiple test cases, each specifying the number of problems, the number of problems required per contest, and the number of days available. It processes each test case to determine the maximum number of contests that can be held, given the constraints of the total number of problems available and the number of days. It calculates the total number of problems for each test case and determines the maximum possible contests by dividing this total by the number of problems required per contest. The result for each test case is the minimum between this calculated maximum and the number of days available. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where there is a need to allocate limited resources over a fixed period, ensuring that constraints are met. For example, in event planning where each event requires a certain number of resources, and there is a limit on how many events can be held in a given timeframe. It is also applicable in project management, where tasks require a certain number of resources, and there is a deadline for completion. The solution involves calculating the total available resources, determining how many complete sets of resources can be formed, and then limiting the number of events or tasks by the maximum allowed within the given period."
