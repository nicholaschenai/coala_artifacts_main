    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to determine if a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \\( H \\) and area \\( S \\) could exist, and if so, to find the side lengths. The core concept involved using the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle to derive a quadratic equation. The challenge was to solve this equation to find valid side lengths.\n\nThe key steps included:\n1. **Formulating the Problem**: Using the relationships \\( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \\) and \\( a \\times b = 2S \\), we derived a quadratic equation in terms of \\( a^2 \\).\n2. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**: We used the quadratic formula to find potential values for \\( a^2 \\) and checked the discriminant to ensure real solutions.\n3. **Validating Solutions**: For each potential solution, we calculated \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), ensuring they were positive and satisfied the original conditions.\n\nThe solution involved careful handling of mathematical operations and ensuring numerical stability, especially when dealing with large numbers.

    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse and area, the approach I took was quite similar to the official solution, with both relying on solving a quadratic equation derived from the triangle's properties. Here are some key insights and takeaways:\n\n1. **Quadratic Equation Derivation**: Both solutions correctly derived the quadratic equation from the conditions \\( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \\) and \\( a \\times b = 2S \\). This step is crucial as it transforms the problem into a solvable mathematical equation.\n\n2. **Discriminant Check**: The official solution and my approach both check the discriminant \\( H^4 - 16S^2 \\) to ensure real solutions exist. This is a critical step to determine if a valid triangle can be formed.\n\n3. **Simplification and Efficiency**: The official solution simplifies the calculation by directly computing the potential side lengths \\( B \\) and \\( P \\) using the quadratic formula and then checking their validity. This approach is efficient and avoids unnecessary calculations.\n\n4. **Output Formatting**: The official solution uses Python's string formatting to ensure the output precision, which is a good practice for problems requiring specific output formats.\n\n5. **Handling Edge Cases**: Both solutions handle cases where no valid triangle can be formed by outputting -1, ensuring robustness against invalid inputs.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of translating geometric properties into algebraic equations and solving them efficiently. The official solution's direct approach to calculating side lengths and its use of Python's built-in functions for precision formatting are valuable techniques for similar problems in the future.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and pairs of integers representing the height and area of a triangle. For each test case, it calculates the possible side lengths of a right triangle with the given height and area using another function. If a valid triangle can be formed, it appends the sorted side lengths formatted to five decimal places to a results list; otherwise, it appends \"-1\". Finally, it prints each result from the list.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the feasibility of constructing a right-angled triangle given specific constraints on the hypotenuse and area. It applies to problems in geometry and trigonometry where understanding the relationship between the sides of a triangle and its area is crucial. This can be particularly useful in computer graphics, physics simulations, and architectural design where precise geometric calculations are necessary. Additionally, it can be applied in educational settings to test understanding of geometric properties and in competitive programming where efficient algorithms are required to handle large input sizes."
