INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If no such triangle can exist, we should output \(-1\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Given Conditions**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( A = S \).

3. **Formulate the Problem**:
   - From the area formula: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - From the Pythagorean theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).

4. **Solve for \( a \) and \( b \)**:
   - Express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the area equation: \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Substitute \( b \) in the Pythagorean equation: \( a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2 \).
   - Simplify and solve the resulting quadratic equation in terms of \( a^2 \).

5. **Check for Validity**:
   - Ensure that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is non-negative for real solutions.
   - Calculate \( a \) and \( b \) and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality and area conditions.

6. **Output**:
   - If valid \( a \) and \( b \) are found, output them along with \( H \) in sorted order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output \(-1\).

## Pseudocode

```
function find_triangle_sides(H, S):
    if 4 * S > H^2:
        return -1
    discriminant = H^4 - 16 * S^2
    if discriminant < 0:
        return -1
    a_squared = (H^2 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    b_squared = (H^2 - sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    if a_squared < 0 or b_squared < 0:
        return -1
    a = sqrt(a_squared)
    b = sqrt(b_squared)
    return sorted([a, b, H])

read T
for each test case:
    read H, S
    result = find_triangle_sides(H, S)
    print result
```

## Python Code

```python

import math

def find_triangle_sides(H, S):
    # Check if the area is too large for the given hypotenuse
    if 4 * S > H * H:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation
    discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S
    
    # If the discriminant is negative, no real solutions exist
    if discriminant < 0:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate a^2 and b^2 using the quadratic formula
    a_squared = (H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    b_squared = (H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    
    # If either a^2 or b^2 is negative, no valid triangle sides exist
    if a_squared < 0 or b_squared < 0:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the actual side lengths
    a = math.sqrt(a_squared)
    b = math.sqrt(b_squared)
    
    # Return the sides sorted in non-decreasing order
    return f"{min(a, b):.5f} {max(a, b):.5f} {H:.5f}"

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
      \[
      S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
      \]
      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

    ### Strategy:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_nth_term(N):
        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_nth_term(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for counting triangles with vertices of the same color, I gained several insights:

    1. **Output Formatting**: The primary issue in my initial solution was the incorrect formatting of the output. The official solution correctly handles the output by ensuring the list of colors is not nested and is followed by the count of triangles. This highlights the importance of carefully matching the expected output format.

    2. **Collinearity Check**: My solution used a determinant method to check for collinearity, which is mathematically sound. However, the official solution uses a different approach by calculating the area of the triangle using Heron's formula. This method is effective because it directly checks if the area is greater than zero, ensuring the points are not collinear.

    3. **Efficiency and Clarity**: The official solution is concise and leverages Python's dictionary and list comprehensions effectively. It groups points by color, calculates possible triangles using combinations, and determines the maximum number of triangles in a straightforward manner. This approach is both efficient and easy to understand.

    4. **Use of Built-in Functions**: The use of `itertools.combinations` in both my solution and the official one is crucial for generating all possible sets of three points. This built-in function simplifies the process of checking all combinations, which is essential for problems involving subsets.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of output formatting and provided an alternative method for checking collinearity through area calculation. The official solution's clarity and efficiency serve as a good example of leveraging Python's capabilities to solve geometric problems.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If no such triangle exists, we should output -1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( S \) of the triangle is given by: \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( S \).
   - We need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
     - \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \)
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \)

3. **Deriving the Equations**:
   - From the area equation: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - Substitute \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean equation:
     \[
     a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2
     \]
   - Simplify to get a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \):
     \[
     a^4 - H^2a^2 + 4S^2 = 0
     \]

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   - Let \( x = a^2 \). The equation becomes:
     \[
     x^2 - H^2x + 4S^2 = 0
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \) using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{H^2 \pm \sqrt{H^4 - 16S^2}}{2}
     \]
   - Check if the discriminant \( H^4 - 16S^2 \) is non-negative to ensure real solutions.

5. **Finding \( a \) and \( b \)**:
   - If valid \( x \) is found, compute \( a = \sqrt{x} \) and \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Ensure \( a \) and \( b \) are positive and satisfy the original conditions.

 ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If no such triangle exists, we should output -1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( S \) of the triangle is given by: \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( S \).
   - We need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
     - \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \)
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \)

3. **Deriving the Equations**:
   - From the area equation: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - Substitute \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean equation:
     \[
     a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2
     \]
   - Simplify to get a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \):
     \[
     a^4 - H^2a^2 + 4S^2 = 0
     \]

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   - Let \( x = a^2 \). The equation becomes:
     \[
     x^2 - H^2x + 4S^2 = 0
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \) using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{H^2 \pm \sqrt{H^4 - 16S^2}}{2}
     \]
   - Check if the discriminant \( H^4 - 16S^2 \) is non-negative to ensure real solutions.

5. **Finding \( a \) and \( b \)**:
   - If valid \( x \) is found, compute \( a = \sqrt{x} \) and \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Ensure \( a \) and \( b \) are positive and satisfy the original conditions.

### Pseudocode

    if H^4 < 16 * S^2:
        return -1

        discriminant = H^4 - 16 * S^2
        x1 = (H^2 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
        x2 = (H^2 - sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
        if x1 >= 0:
            a1 = sqrt(x1)
            b1 = 2 * S / a1
            if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0:
                return sorted([a1, b1, H])
        if x2 >= 0:
            a2 = sqrt(x2)
            b2 = 2 * S / a2
            if a2 > 0 and b2 > 0:
                return sorted([a2, b2, H])
        return -1

    read T
    for each test case:

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If no such triangle exists, we should output -1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( S \) of the triangle is given by: \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( S \).
   - We need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
     - \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \)
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \)

3. **Deriving the Equations**:
   - From the area equation: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - Substitute \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean equation:
     \[
     a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2
     \]
   - Simplify to get a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \):
     \[
     a^4 - H^2a^2 + 4S^2 = 0
     \]

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   - Let \( x = a^2 \). The equation becomes:
     \[
     x^2 - H^2x + 4S^2 = 0
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \) using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{H^2 \pm \sqrt{H^4 - 16S^2}}{2}
     \]
   - Check if the discriminant \( H^4 - 16S^2 \) is non-negative to ensure real solutions.

5. **Finding \( a \) and \( b \)**:
   - If valid \( x \) is found, compute \( a = \sqrt{x} \) and \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Ensure \( a \) and \( b \) are positive and satisfy the original conditions.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine if a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \) could exist, and if so, to find the side lengths. The core concept involved using the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle to derive a quadratic equation. The challenge was to solve this equation to find valid side lengths.

The key steps included:
1. **Formulating the Problem**: Using the relationships \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \) and \( a \times b = 2S \), we derived a quadratic equation in terms of \( a^2 \).
2. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**: We used the quadratic formula to find potential values for \( a^2 \) and checked the discriminant to ensure real solutions.
3. **Validating Solutions**: For each potential solution, we calculated \( a \) and \( b \), ensuring they were positive and satisfied the original conditions.

The solution involved careful handling of mathematical operations and ensuring numerical stability, especially when dealing with large numbers. The approach was successful, and the code passed all test cases, confirming the correctness of the logic and implementation.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If no such triangle exists, we should output -1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( S \) of the triangle is given by: \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( S \).
   - We need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
     - \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \)
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \)

3. **Deriving the Equations**:
   - From the area equation: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - Substitute \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean equation:
     \[
     a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2
     \]
   - Simplify to get a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \):
     \[
     a^4 - H^2a^2 + 4S^2 = 0
     \]

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   - Let \( x = a^2 \). The equation becomes:
     \[
     x^2 - H^2x + 4S^2 = 0
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \) using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{H^2 \pm \sqrt{H^4 - 16S^2}}{2}
     \]
   - Check if the discriminant \( H^4 - 16S^2 \) is non-negative to ensure real solutions.

5. **Finding \( a \) and \( b \)**:
   - If valid \( x \) is found, compute \( a = \sqrt{x} \) and \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Ensure \( a \) and \( b \) are positive and satisfy the original conditions.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

 else:
  B = (math.sqrt((h*h) + math.sqrt((h*h*h*h) - (16*s*s))))/math.sqrt(2)
  P = (2*s)/B
  if(B > P):

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse and area, the approach I took was quite similar to the official solution, with both relying on solving a quadratic equation derived from the triangle's properties. Here are some key insights and takeaways:

1. **Quadratic Equation Derivation**: Both solutions correctly derived the quadratic equation from the conditions \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \) and \( a \times b = 2S \). This step is crucial as it transforms the problem into a solvable mathematical equation.

2. **Discriminant Check**: The official solution and my approach both check the discriminant \( H^4 - 16S^2 \) to ensure real solutions exist. This is a critical step to determine if a valid triangle can be formed.

3. **Simplification and Efficiency**: The official solution simplifies the calculation by directly computing the potential side lengths \( B \) and \( P \) using the quadratic formula and then checking their validity. This approach is efficient and avoids unnecessary calculations.

4. **Output Formatting**: The official solution uses Python's string formatting to ensure the output precision, which is a good practice for problems requiring specific output formats.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: Both solutions handle cases where no valid triangle can be formed by outputting -1, ensuring robustness against invalid inputs.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of translating geometric properties into algebraic equations and solving them efficiently. The official solution's direct approach to calculating side lengths and its use of Python's built-in functions for precision formatting are valuable techniques for similar problems in the future.
