The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \\(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots\\).\n    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: \n      \\[\n      S(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2N-1)}{6}\n      \\]\n      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.\n    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_term(N):\n        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = calculate_nth_term(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for counting triangles with vertices of the same color, I gained several insights:\n\n    1. **Output Formatting**: The primary issue in my initial solution was the incorrect formatting of the output. The official solution correctly handles the output by ensuring the list of colors is not nested and is followed by the count of triangles. This highlights the importance of carefully matching the expected output format.\n\n    2. **Collinearity Check**: My solution used a determinant method to check for collinearity, which is mathematically sound. However, the official solution uses a different approach by calculating the area of the triangle using Heron's formula. This method is effective because it directly checks if the area is greater than zero, ensuring the points are not collinear.\n\n    3. **Efficiency and Clarity**: The official solution is concise and leverages Python's dictionary and list comprehensions effectively. It groups points by color, calculates possible triangles using combinations, and determines the maximum number of triangles in a straightforward manner. This approach is both efficient and easy to understand.\n\n    4. **Use of Built-in Functions**: The use of `itertools.combinations` in both my solution and the official one is crucial for generating all possible sets of three points. This built-in function simplifies the process of checking all combinations, which is essential for problems involving subsets.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of output formatting and provided an alternative method for checking collinearity through area calculation. The official solution's clarity and efficiency serve as a good example of leveraging Python's capabilities to solve geometric problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
