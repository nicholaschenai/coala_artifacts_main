INFO - [Task id] 137 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an integer `n` and need to transform it into `0` using a specific set of operations on its binary representation. The operations allowed are:
   - Change the rightmost bit (0th bit).
   - Change the ith bit if the (i-1)th bit is 1 and all bits from (i-2) to 0 are 0.
   
   The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform `n` into `0`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The problem can be approached by understanding the pattern of operations needed to transform a binary number to zero. The operations are similar to a Gray code transformation, where each bit change depends on the state of the previous bits. The key is to recursively determine the number of operations needed for each bit position, considering the constraints given.

   The transformation can be thought of as a recursive process:
   - If `n` is `0`, no operations are needed.
   - For a non-zero `n`, find the highest bit set to `1` (let's call it `k`).
   - Flip the `k`th bit, which requires a certain number of operations based on the Gray code pattern.
   - Recursively solve the problem for the remaining bits after flipping the `k`th bit.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function minimumOneBitOperations(n):
       if n is 0:
           return 0
       find the highest bit position k where n has a 1
       calculate the number of operations needed to flip the k-th bit
       recursively calculate the operations needed for the remaining bits
       return the total number of operations
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Helper function to calculate the minimum operations
        def helper(n):
            if n == 0:
                return 0
            # Find the highest bit position k where n has a 1
            k = n.bit_length() - 1
            # Calculate the number of operations needed to flip the k-th bit
            # This is equivalent to 2^(k+1) - 1 - helper(n ^ (1 << k))
            # The formula is derived from the pattern of operations in Gray code
            return (1 << (k + 1)) - 1 - helper(n ^ (1 << k))
        
        # Call the helper function with the initial value of n
        return helper(n)
```

This solution uses a recursive approach to determine the minimum number of operations needed to transform `n` into `0`. The key insight is recognizing the pattern of operations as similar to a Gray code transformation, allowing us to use a recursive formula to calculate the number of operations efficiently.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a positive integer `n`. We need to transform `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:
        - If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.
        - If `n` is odd, replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

        The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach:
        1. If `n` is even, the best move is to divide it by 2, as this reduces `n` significantly.
        2. If `n` is odd, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice should be made based on which operation will lead to a number that is easier to reduce to 1. Generally, if `n + 1` or `n - 1` results in a number that is divisible by 4, it is preferable because it allows for more divisions by 2 in subsequent steps.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function integerReplacement(n):
            count = 0
            while n is not 1:
                if n is even:
                    n = n / 2
                else:
                    if n is 3 or n - 1 is divisible by 4:
                        n = n - 1
                    else:
                        n = n + 1
                count = count + 1
            return count
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
                count = 0
                while n != 1:
                    if n % 2 == 0:
                        # If n is even, divide by 2
                        n //= 2
                    else:
                        # If n is odd, decide whether to increment or decrement
                        # Prefer decrement if n is 3 or n-1 is divisible by 4
                        if n == 3 or (n & 2) == 0:
                            n -= 1
                        else:
                            n += 1
                    count += 1
                return count
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - We initialize a counter `count` to track the number of operations.
        - We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.
        - If `n` is even, we divide it by 2.
        - If `n` is odd, we check if `n` is `3` or if `n-1` is divisible by 4. In these cases, decrementing is more beneficial. Otherwise, we increment `n`.
        - We increment the `count` for each operation performed.
        - Finally, we return the `count` as the minimum number of operations needed.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The challenge was to determine the optimal choice when `n` is odd to minimize the total number of operations.

    The core concept here is a greedy approach, where the decision at each step is made to reduce `n` as quickly as possible. For even numbers, the choice is straightforward: divide by 2. For odd numbers, the decision is based on whether incrementing or decrementing will lead to a number that is more easily reduced in subsequent steps. Specifically, if `n` is 3 or `n-1` is divisible by 4, decrementing is preferred. Otherwise, incrementing is the better choice.

    The solution was implemented using a loop that continues until `n` becomes 1, with a counter to track the number of operations. The logic for choosing between incrementing and decrementing was based on bitwise operations to check divisibility by 4, which is efficient and straightforward.

    This problem reinforced the importance of making optimal local decisions in a greedy algorithm to achieve a globally optimal solution. The use of bitwise operations for efficiency was also a key takeaway. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness of the approach.

   We need to transform a given integer `n` into `0` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:
   - Flip the rightmost bit (0th bit) of `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The problem can be approached by understanding the binary representation of `n`. The operations allowed are essentially flipping bits under certain conditions. The key is to determine the minimum number of flips required to turn all bits to `0`.

   The solution involves:
   - Using a recursive approach to calculate the number of operations needed to transform `n` to `0`.
   - If the rightmost bit is `1`, flip it and recursively solve for `n-1`.

INFO - [Task id] 137 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to transform a given integer `n` into `0` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:
   - Flip the rightmost bit (0th bit) of `n`.
   - Flip the `i-th` bit if the `(i-1)th` bit is `1` and all bits from `0` to `(i-2)` are `0`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The problem can be approached by understanding the binary representation of `n`. The operations allowed are essentially flipping bits under certain conditions. The key is to determine the minimum number of flips required to turn all bits to `0`.

   The solution involves:
   - Using a recursive approach to calculate the number of operations needed to transform `n` to `0`.
   - If the rightmost bit is `1`, flip it and recursively solve for `n-1`.
   - If the rightmost bit is `0`, find the next `1` bit, flip it, and recursively solve for the number formed by the bits to the right of this `1`.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function minimumOneBitOperations(n):
       if n is 0:
           return 0
       else:
           highest_bit = find the position of the highest set bit in n
           return 2^highest_bit - 1 - minimumOneBitOperations(n XOR (1 << highest_bit))
   ```

   - The function `find the position of the highest set bit` finds the position of the most significant bit that is set to `1`.

INFO - [Task id] 137 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to transform an integer `n` into `0` using the minimum number of bit-flipping operations. The operations allowed were flipping the rightmost bit or flipping a bit if certain conditions on the preceding bits were met. The core concept here was understanding how to manipulate binary numbers efficiently using bitwise operations.

The solution involved a recursive approach where the key was to identify the position of the highest set bit in the binary representation of `n`. By flipping this bit and all bits to the right, we could reduce the problem size and recursively solve for the remaining bits. The formula `(1 << highest_bit) - 1` was used to calculate the number of operations needed to flip all bits up to the highest bit.

A helper function was used to find the position of the highest set bit, which was crucial for determining the next steps in the recursion. The recursive function then used XOR operations to flip the necessary bits and reduce the problem size.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding bitwise operations and recursive problem-solving strategies. The approach was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the recursive method combined with bit manipulation.

INFO - [Task id] 137 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to transform a given integer `n` into `0` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:
   - Flip the rightmost bit (0th bit) of `n`.
   - Flip the `i-th` bit if the `(i-1)th` bit is `1` and all bits from `0` to `(i-2)` are `0`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The problem can be approached by understanding the binary representation of `n`. The operations allowed are essentially flipping bits under certain conditions. The key is to determine the minimum number of flips required to turn all bits to `0`.

   The solution involves:
   - Using a recursive approach to calculate the number of operations needed to transform `n` to `0`.
   - If the rightmost bit is `1`, flip it and recursively solve for `n-1`.
   - If the rightmost bit is `0`, find the next `1` bit, flip it, and recursively solve for the number formed by the bits to the right of this `1`.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   function minimumOneBitOperations(n):

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        s = 0
        m = n
        while m:
            s += m & 1
            m >>= 1

        k = 1
        while s:
            s -= bool(n & k)
            n ^= (s & 1) and k
            k <<= 1

        return n

INFO - [Task id] 137 [generation text] The official solution to the problem provides a more iterative approach compared to my recursive solution. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Bit Counting and Initialization:**
   - The solution starts by counting the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of `n` using a variable `s`. This is done by iterating through the bits of `n` using a bitwise AND operation (`m & 1`) and right-shifting `m` until it becomes zero.

2. **Iterative Bit Flipping:**
   - The solution uses a loop to iteratively flip bits in `n`. It uses a variable `k` to track the current bit position being considered.
   - For each bit position, it checks if the current bit in `n` is set (`n & k`). If it is, it decrements `s`.
   - The bit is flipped using XOR (`n ^= (s & 1) and k`) if `s` is odd, which ensures that the correct number of operations are performed to transform `n` to `0`.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The official solution is efficient as it directly manipulates the bits of `n` without recursion, making it potentially faster and more space-efficient for large values of `n`.

In summary, the official solution provides a more direct and iterative method to solve the problem, which can be advantageous in terms of performance. The use of bitwise operations and careful tracking of the number of `1` bits (`s`) allows for a clear and efficient transformation of `n` to `0`. This approach is insightful for problems involving bit manipulation and can be a useful technique in similar scenarios.
