    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to transform a given integer `n` into `0` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:\n   - Flip the rightmost bit (0th bit) of `n`.\n   - Flip the `i-th` bit if the `(i-1)th` bit is `1` and all bits from `0` to `(i-2)` are `0`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The problem can be approached by understanding the binary representation of `n`. The operations allowed are essentially flipping bits under certain conditions. The key is to determine the minimum number of flips required to turn all bits to `0`.\n\n   The solution involves:\n   - Using a recursive approach to calculate the number of operations needed to transform `n` to `0`.\n   - If the rightmost bit is `1`, flip it and recursively solve for `n-1`.\n   - If the rightmost bit is `0`, find the next `1` bit, flip it, and recursively solve for the number formed by the bits to the right of this `1`.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function minimumOneBitOperations(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 0\n       else:\n           highest_bit = find the position of the highest set bit in n\n           return 2^highest_bit - 1 - minimumOneBitOperations(n XOR (1 << highest_bit))\n   ```\n\n   - The function `find the position of the highest set bit` finds the position of the most significant bit that is set to `1`.\n   - The expression `n XOR (1 << highest_bit)` flips the highest set bit and all bits to the right of it.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n        # Helper function to find the position of the highest set bit\n        def highest_bit_position(x):\n            pos = 0\n            while x > 0:\n                x >>= 1\n                pos += 1\n            return pos - 1\n        \n        # Base case: if n is 0, no operations are needed\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Find the position of the highest set bit\n        highest_bit = highest_bit_position(n)\n        \n        # Calculate the number of operations needed\n        # 2^highest_bit - 1 gives the number of operations to flip all bits up to the highest bit\n        # Recursively solve for the number formed by flipping the highest bit and all bits to the right\n        return (1 << highest_bit) - 1 - self.minimumOneBitOperations(n ^ (1 << highest_bit))\n```\n\n- The function `highest_bit_position` determines the position of the most significant bit set to `1`.\n- The main function uses recursion to calculate the minimum number of operations by flipping the highest set bit and solving for the remaining bits.",
