For each test case, we need to determine the number of inversions in the array. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j].\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The merge sort algorithm can be adapted to count inversions while sorting the array. The key idea is that during the merge step, if an element from the right half of the array is smaller than an element from the left half, then it forms an inversion with all remaining elements in the left half.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Divide and Conquer**: Use the merge sort algorithm to divide the array into two halves until each subarray contains a single element.\n\n2. **Count Inversions During Merge**: While merging two halves, count the inversions. If an element from the right half is smaller than an element from the left half, it forms inversions with all remaining elements in the left half.\n\n3. **Combine Results**: The total number of inversions is the sum of inversions found in the left half, right half, and during the merge step.\n\n4. **Repeat for Each Test Case**: Apply the above steps for each test case and output the result.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n    i = left\n    j = mid + 1\n    k = left\n    inv_count = 0\n\n    while i <= mid and j <= right:\n        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n            inv_count += (mid - i + 1)\n            j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    while i <= mid:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n        i += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    while j <= right:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n        j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    for i from left to right:\n        arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n    return inv_count\n\nfunction merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n    inv_count = 0\n    if left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n        inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n    return inv_count\n\nfunction count_inversions(arr):\n    temp_arr = copy of arr\n    return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, length of arr - 1)\n\nread T\nfor each test case:\n    read N\n    read array of N numbers\n    print count_inversions(array)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n    i = left    # Starting index for left subarray\n    j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray\n    k = left    # Starting index to be sorted\n    inv_count = 0\n\n    # Conditions are checked to ensure that i doesn't exceed mid and j doesn't exceed right\n    while i <= mid and j <= right:\n        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            # There are mid - i inversions, because all the remaining elements in the left subarray\n            # (arr[i], arr[i+1], ..., arr[mid]) are greater than arr[j]\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n            inv_count += (mid - i + 1)\n            j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the remaining elements of left subarray, if any\n    while i <= mid:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n        i += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the remaining elements of right subarray, if any\n    while j <= right:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n        j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the sorted subarray into Original array\n    for i in range(left, right + 1):\n        arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n    return inv_count\n\ndef merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n    inv_count = 0\n    if left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n        inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n\n    return inv_count\n\ndef count_inversions(arr):\n    temp_arr = arr[:]\n    return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        results.append(count_inversions(arr))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently counts inversions using a modified merge sort algorithm, which runs in O(N log N) time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the problem constraints."

Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: \n           - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.\n           - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.\n\n        2. **Constraints**:\n           - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.\n           - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.\n\n        3. **Combinatorial Approach**:\n           - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:\n             - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.\n             - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.\n           - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.\n           - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.\n\n        4. **Modulo Operation**:\n           - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10^9 + 7\n            precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N\n\n            results = []\n            for each query (I, K):\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD\n                    count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        function precompute_factorials(N):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i from 2 to N:\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i from N-1 down to 1:\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        function C(n, k):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n            # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n            factorials, inverse_factorials = precompute_factorials(N, MOD)\n    \n            results = []\n            for I, K in queries:\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD)\n                    count_greater = pow(2, N-I, MOD)\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        def precompute_factorials(N, MOD):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i in range(2, N+1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i in range(N-1, 0, -1):\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        def C(n, k, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                queries = []\n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n                    queries.append((I, K))\n        \n                results.extend(calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries))\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently calculates the number of subsets for each query by precomputing factorials and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '3 3', '1 2', '2 1', '3 2'] Output: 0\n        2\n        2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be made to sum to zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.\n\n    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.\n\n    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.\n\n    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n        \n            sum_A = sum(A)\n            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                k = sum_A // sum_indices\n                possible = True\n                for i in range(N):\n                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                if possible:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is inefficient for large arrays.\n   - A more efficient approach is to use a modified merge sort algorithm, which can count inversions in O(N log N) time.\n\n3. **Merge Sort for Counting Inversions**:\n   - During the merge step of merge sort, if an element from the right half is smaller than an element from the left half, it indicates an inversion.\n   - The number of such inversions is equal to the number of remaining elements in the left half.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n    i = left\n    j = mid + 1\n    k = left\n    inv_count = 0\n\n    while i <= mid and j <= right:\n        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n            inv_count += (mid - i + 1)\n            j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    while i <= mid:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n        i += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    while j <= right:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n        j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    for i from left to right:\n        arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n    return inv_count\n\nfunction merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n    inv_count = 0\n    if left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n        inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n    return inv_count\n\nfunction count_inversions(arr):\n    temp_arr = [0] * len(arr)\n    return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n    i = left    # Starting index for left subarray\n    j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray\n    k = left    # Starting index to be sorted\n    inv_count = 0\n\n    # Conditions are checked to ensure that i doesn't exceed mid and j doesn't exceed right\n    while i <= mid and j <= right:\n        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            # There are mid - i inversions, because all elements left to i in the left subarray\n            # are greater than arr[j]\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n            inv_count += (mid - i + 1)\n            j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the remaining elements of left subarray, if any\n    while i <= mid:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n        i += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the remaining elements of right subarray, if any\n    while j <= right:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n        j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the sorted subarray into Original array\n    for i in range(left, right + 1):\n        arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n    return inv_count\n\ndef merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n    inv_count = 0\n    if left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n        inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n\n    return inv_count\n\ndef count_inversions(arr):\n    temp_arr = [0] * len(arr)\n    return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        results.append(count_inversions(arr))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently counts the number of inversions in each test case using a modified merge sort algorithm."

The core concept here is to efficiently count the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. The naive O(N^2) approach of checking each pair is impractical for large arrays, so the merge sort technique, which operates in O(N log N) time, is ideal.\n\nThe key insight is during the merge step of merge sort: when an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, it indicates an inversion. The number of such inversions is equal to the number of remaining elements in the left subarray. This allows us to count inversions while sorting the array.\n\nThe solution involves two main functions: `merge_and_count` to handle the merging and counting of inversions, and `merge_sort_and_count` to recursively sort the array and accumulate inversion counts. The `count_inversions` function initializes the process, and the `main` function handles input/output.\n\nThis approach was successful, and the problem was straightforward once the merge sort inversion counting technique was applied. The experience reinforced the utility of divide-and-conquer algorithms for efficiently solving problems that involve pairwise comparisons."

Inversions are pairs of elements that are out of order, and counting them can help in understanding the disorder in a dataset. This is particularly useful in algorithms that require sorting or need to measure how far a sequence is from being sorted. The solution uses a modified merge sort algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose, making it applicable in scenarios where the array size is large, as it operates in O(N log N) time complexity.
