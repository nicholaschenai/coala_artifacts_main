    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nChef wants to create a schedule for his restaurant where each day features a different dish from a set of four Ukrainian dishes. The schedule must ensure that no two consecutive days have the same dish, and the first and last days must also feature different dishes. Given the number of days `N`, we need to determine how many such valid schedules exist, and output the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - We have four dishes: salo, borsch, varenyky, and galushky.\n   - For `N` days, we need to create a schedule where:\n     - No two consecutive days have the same dish.\n     - The first and last days have different dishes.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - For `N = 2`, we can choose any dish for the first day and any of the remaining three dishes for the second day. This gives us \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) schedules.\n   - For `N = 3`, we can choose any dish for the first day, any of the remaining three for the second day, and any of the remaining three for the third day (excluding the first day's dish). This gives us \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\\) schedules.\n   - For `N = 4`, the pattern continues similarly, but we must ensure the first and last days are different.\n\n3. **General Formula**:\n   - For `N` days, the number of valid schedules can be calculated using:\n     - \\(4 \\times 3^{N-2} \\times 2\\)\n   - This formula accounts for:\n     - 4 choices for the first day.\n     - \\(3^{N-2}\\) choices for the middle days (each day can be any of the three dishes not used the previous day).\n     - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it's different from the first day.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**:\n   - Since the result can be large, compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):\n    MOD = 10^9 + 7\n    results = []\n    for each N in test_cases:\n        if N == 2:\n            result = 12\n        else:\n            result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n        results.append(result)\n    return results\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    results = []\n    for N in test_cases:\n        if N == 2:\n            result = 12\n        else:\n            result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n        results.append(result)\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n    results = calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution reads the number of test cases and the number of days for each test case, calculates the number of valid schedules using the derived formula, and outputs the result for each test case.",
