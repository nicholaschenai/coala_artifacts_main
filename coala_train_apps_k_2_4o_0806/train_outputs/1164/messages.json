Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).\nThe difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:\n- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.\n- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.\n- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.\n- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.\nYou should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels.

The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of problems and a limit on the number of days.\n\n    Key insights from the problem-solving process:\n\n    1. **Total Problems Calculation**: Both solutions start by calculating the total number of problems available by summing up the problems created by each setter. This is a crucial step as it determines the potential number of contests that can be hosted.\n\n    2. **Maximum Contests Calculation**: The next step is to calculate the maximum number of contests that can be hosted by dividing the total number of problems by `K`, the number of problems required per contest. This gives the theoretical maximum number of contests.\n\n    3. **Day Constraint**: The final step is to consider the constraint on the number of days (`D`). The actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of the theoretical maximum contests and `D`.\n\n    The official solution is concise and directly implements these steps in a few lines of code. It uses Python's built-in functions to read input, calculate the necessary values, and output the result efficiently. The use of `min(P, D)` succinctly handles the day constraint, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.\n\n    Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and using simple arithmetic operations to derive the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints on the number of problems and days. The key steps involved calculating the total number of problems available, determining the maximum possible contests based on the number of problems required per contest, and then considering the constraint of the number of days available to host these contests.\n\n    The strategy that worked was straightforward: first, sum up all the problems from the setters to get the total number of problems. Then, calculate how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`). Finally, the actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of this number and the number of days (`D`), since only one contest can be hosted per day.\n\n    The problem was relatively simple, and the solution was implemented efficiently by iterating over each test case, performing the calculations, and storing the results. The solution passed all test cases without any issues, indicating that the approach was correct and the implementation was robust. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and efficiently using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "\n[description for function: calculate_difficulty]\nThe function processes a list of problems, each with associated scores and contestant identifiers, to determine the difficulty of each problem based on the number of times the contestant identifiers decrease when sorted by scores. For each problem, it pairs scores with contestants, sorts these pairs by score, and counts how often a contestant identifier is greater than the next one in the sorted list. It then stores the difficulty as a tuple containing the count of such decreases and the problem index. The list of difficulties is sorted first by the decrease count and then by the negative of the problem index to prioritize problems with the same difficulty by their original order. Finally, it prints the indices of the problems in order of increasing difficulty.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to rank or sort items based on a custom difficulty metric that involves multiple attributes. Specifically, it applies to situations where you have a set of tasks or problems, each with multiple components or subtasks, and you need to determine the difficulty based on the performance or results of these subtasks. The method of sorting by a pair of values, where the primary value is a count of a specific condition (like a decrease in performance) and the secondary value is an identifier, is a common pattern in competitive programming and algorithm design. This approach can be adapted to other contexts where tasks are evaluated based on multiple criteria, and a ranking is needed based on these evaluations."
