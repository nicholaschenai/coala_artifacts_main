## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on the number of subtasks where the number of contestants solving it decreases as the score increases. The difficulty of a problem is represented as a pair of integers, where the first integer is the count of such subtasks and the second is the problem's index. We need to sort the problems by difficulty, first by the count of decreasing subtasks and then by the problem index if counts are equal.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each problem, pair the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
2. Sort these pairs by score to ensure the subtasks are in increasing order of score.
3. Count the number of times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.
4. Store the difficulty as a tuple of this count and the problem index.
5. Sort all problems by their difficulty tuples.
6. Output the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    for i from 0 to P-1:
        scores = problems[2*i]
        contestants = problems[2*i + 1]
        subtask_pairs = zip(scores, contestants)
        sorted_subtasks = sort(subtask_pairs by score)
        count_decreasing = 0
        for j from 0 to S-2:
            if sorted_subtasks[j][1] > sorted_subtasks[j+1][1]:
                count_decreasing += 1
        difficulties.append((count_decreasing, i+1))
    sort difficulties by (count_decreasing, index)
    return indices from sorted difficulties

read P, S
read problems as list of lists
result = calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems)
for each index in result:
    print index
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    
    for i in range(P):
        scores = problems[2 * i]
        contestants = problems[2 * i + 1]
        
        # Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
        subtask_pairs = list(zip(scores, contestants))
        subtask_pairs.sort()  # Sort by score automatically
        
        # Count the number of decreasing contestant numbers
        count_decreasing = 0
        for j in range(S - 1):
            if subtask_pairs[j][1] > subtask_pairs[j + 1][1]:
                count_decreasing += 1
        
        # Store the difficulty as a tuple (count_decreasing, problem_index)
        difficulties.append((count_decreasing, i + 1))
    
    # Sort difficulties by (count_decreasing, problem_index)
    difficulties.sort()
    
    # Extract and return the sorted problem indices
    return [index for _, index in difficulties]

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

P = int(data[0])
S = int(data[1])

problems = []
index = 2
for _ in range(2 * P):
    problems.append(list(map(int, data[index:index + S])))
    index += S

# Calculate and print the result
result = calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems)
for index in result:
    print(index)
```

This solution reads input, processes each problem to determine its difficulty, sorts the problems by difficulty, and outputs the indices in the required order.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is straightforward given the problem constraints. The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of problems and a limit on the number of days.

    Key insights from the problem-solving process:

    1. **Total Problems Calculation**: Both solutions start by calculating the total number of problems available by summing up the problems created by each setter. This is a crucial step as it determines the potential number of contests that can be hosted.

    2. **Maximum Contests Calculation**: The next step is to calculate the maximum number of contests that can be hosted by dividing the total number of problems by `K`, the number of problems required per contest. This gives the theoretical maximum number of contests.

    3. **Day Constraint**: The final step is to consider the constraint on the number of days (`D`). The actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of the theoretical maximum contests and `D`.

    The official solution is concise and directly implements these steps in a few lines of code. It uses Python's built-in functions to read input, calculate the necessary values, and output the result efficiently. The use of `min(P, D)` succinctly handles the day constraint, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.

    Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and using simple arithmetic operations to derive the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.
[/Reflection]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints on the number of problems and days. The key steps involved calculating the total number of problems available, determining the maximum possible contests based on the number of problems required per contest, and then considering the constraint of the number of days available to host these contests.

    The strategy that worked was straightforward: first, sum up all the problems from the setters to get the total number of problems. Then, calculate how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`). Finally, the actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of this number and the number of days (`D`), since only one contest can be hosted per day.

    The problem was relatively simple, and the solution was implemented efficiently by iterating over each test case, performing the calculations, and storing the results. The solution passed all test cases without any issues, indicating that the approach was correct and the implementation was robust. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and efficiently using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a contest with multiple problems, each containing several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is determined by counting how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We need to sort the problems by difficulty, where a problem is considered more difficult if it has more decreases, or if the number of decreases is the same, the problem with the higher index is considered more difficult. Finally, we output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of problems `P` and the number of subtasks `S`. For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.

2. **Calculate Difficulty**: For each problem, sort the subtasks by score. Count the number of times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.

3. **Sort Problems**: Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty count and the problem index. Sort this list first by the difficulty count in ascending order, and then by the problem index in descending order if the difficulty counts are the same.

4. **Output**: Extract and print the problem indices from the sorted list.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a contest with multiple problems, each containing several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is determined by counting how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We need to sort the problems by difficulty, where a problem is considered more difficult if it has more decreases, or if the number of decreases is the same, the problem with the higher index is considered more difficult. Finally, we output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of problems `P` and the number of subtasks `S`. For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.

2. **Calculate Difficulty**: For each problem, sort the subtasks by score. Count the number of times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.

3. **Sort Problems**: Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty count and the problem index. Sort this list first by the difficulty count in ascending order, and then by the problem index in descending order if the difficulty counts are the same.

4. **Output**: Extract and print the problem indices from the sorted list.

## Pseudocode

    difficulties = []
    for i from 0 to P-1:
        scores = problems[i][0]
        contestants = problems[i][1]

        paired = zip(scores, contestants)
        sorted_paired = sort(paired by score)
        
        // Count decreases in contestants
        decrease_count = 0

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to determine the difficulty of problems based on the number of decreases in the number of contestants solving subtasks as the subtask scores increase. The key steps involved sorting subtasks by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers. This required careful handling of input parsing and sorting logic.

The strategy that worked was to pair scores with contestant numbers, sort these pairs by score, and then iterate through the sorted list to count decreases. The difficulty was then represented as a tuple of the decrease count and the problem index, which was sorted to determine the order of problem difficulty.

A potential pitfall was ensuring the correct sorting order for the final output, which required sorting by the decrease count in ascending order and by problem index in descending order when counts were equal. This was handled using a custom sort key.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding sorting and tuple manipulation in Python, as well as careful input handling for competitive programming scenarios. The solution was efficient due to the constraints, with a focus on sorting and counting operations.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution successfully solve the problem by calculating the difficulty of each problem based on the number of decreases in the number of contestants who solved the subtasks, and then sorting the problems accordingly. However, there are some differences in the approach and implementation details.

### Key Insights:

1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - My solution uses a list of tuples to store the difficulty and index of each problem, which is then sorted using Python's built-in sort function with a custom key.
   - The official solution uses a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score, which is then sorted by keys and indices. This approach is slightly more complex but achieves the same result.

2. **Sorting Mechanism**:
   - Both solutions sort the subtasks by score to ensure the correct order for counting decreases in the number of contestants. This is crucial for correctly determining the difficulty of each problem.

3. **Complexity and Readability**:
   - My solution is straightforward and leverages Python's sorting capabilities directly on a list of tuples, making it concise and easy to understand.
   - The official solution, while slightly more verbose due to the use of a dictionary, effectively groups problems by difficulty and handles ties by sorting indices within each difficulty group.

### Reflection:

The problem was well within the scope of typical sorting and counting problems, and both solutions handle it efficiently given the constraints. The key takeaway is the importance of choosing the right data structures and sorting mechanisms to simplify the problem-solving process. The use of tuples and sorting by multiple criteria in my solution is a common pattern that can be applied to similar problems in the future. The official solution's use of a dictionary to group by difficulty is also a useful technique when dealing with categorization tasks.

The main function is `calculate_difficulty`.
INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] The function processes a list of problems, each with associated scores and contestant identifiers, to determine the difficulty of each problem based on the number of times the contestant identifiers decrease when sorted by scores. For each problem, it pairs scores with contestants, sorts these pairs by score, and counts how often a contestant identifier is greater than the next one in the sorted list. It then stores the difficulty as a tuple containing the count of such decreases and the problem index. The list of difficulties is sorted first by the decrease count and then by the negative of the problem index to prioritize problems with the same difficulty by their original order. Finally, it prints the indices of the problems in order of increasing difficulty.

You are a helpful assistant that extracts important information from problems and solutions to aid in searchability and education.

## Instructions
- Read through the problem and solution carefully.
- Reason out, step by step, in what scenarios this knowledge would be useful.
- Focus on general patterns and situations to help connect this knowledge to new situations.
- Then, include a list of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair.

## Response format
Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"scenarios": {"description": "In what scenarios will this knowledge be useful? Answer in a paragraph.", "title": "Scenarios", "type": "string"}, "keywords": {"description": "List of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Keywords", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["scenarios", "keywords"]}

[Problem]
    Mandarin chinese
    , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
    Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
    The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
    - Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
    - Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
    - Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
    - For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
    You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
    - $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

    -----Output-----
    Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le P \le 100,000$
    - $2 \le S \le 30$
    - $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
    - $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
    - in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
    Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

    -----Example Input-----
    3 3
    16 24 60
    498 861 589
    14 24 62
