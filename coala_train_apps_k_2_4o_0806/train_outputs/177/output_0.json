    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the smallest substring in a given string `S` that contains all the characters of another string `T`. If no such substring exists, we return an empty string. The solution should be efficient, ideally with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a window in the string `S` that contains all the characters of `T`. We will expand the window by moving the right pointer until the window contains all characters of `T`. Once it does, we will try to shrink the window from the left to find the minimum window that still contains all characters of `T`. We will keep track of the minimum window size and update it whenever we find a smaller valid window.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a dictionary to count characters in T\n   Initialize a dictionary to count characters in the current window\n   Initialize two pointers, left and right, both starting at 0\n   Initialize variables to track the minimum window size and its start position\n   Initialize a variable to count how many characters from T are currently in the window\n\n   While the right pointer is less than the length of S:\n       Add the character at the right pointer to the window count\n       If this character is in T and its count in the window matches its count in T, increment the count of matched characters\n\n       While all characters from T are matched:\n           Update the minimum window size and start position if the current window is smaller\n           Remove the character at the left pointer from the window count\n           If this character is in T and its count in the window is less than its count in T, decrement the count of matched characters\n           Move the left pointer to the right\n\n       Move the right pointer to the right\n\n   If the minimum window size is still infinity, return an empty string\n   Otherwise, return the substring of S starting at the minimum start position with the minimum window size\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        # Step 1: Initialize character count dictionaries for T and the current window\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        \n        t_count = defaultdict(int)\n        window_count = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        for char in t:\n            t_count[char] += 1\n        \n        # Step 2: Initialize pointers and variables to track the minimum window\n        left = 0\n        right = 0\n        min_len = float('inf')\n        min_start = 0\n        matched_chars = 0\n        required_chars = len(t_count)\n        \n        # Step 3: Expand the window by moving the right pointer\n        while right < len(s):\n            char = s[right]\n            window_count[char] += 1\n            \n            # If the current character is in T and its count matches, increment matched_chars\n            if char in t_count and window_count[char] == t_count[char]:\n                matched_chars += 1\n            \n            # Step 4: Try to shrink the window from the left\n            while matched_chars == required_chars:\n                # Update the minimum window if the current window is smaller\n                if right - left + 1 < min_len:\n                    min_len = right - left + 1\n                    min_start = left\n                \n                # Remove the character at the left pointer from the window\n                left_char = s[left]\n                window_count[left_char] -= 1\n                \n                # If the character is in T and its count is less than required, decrement matched_chars\n                if left_char in t_count and window_count[left_char] < t_count[left_char]:\n                    matched_chars -= 1\n                \n                # Move the left pointer to the right\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Move the right pointer to the right\n            right += 1\n        \n        # Step 5: Return the minimum window or an empty string if no valid window was found\n        if min_len == float('inf'):\n            return \"\"\n        else:\n            return s[min_start:min_start + min_len]\n```\n",
