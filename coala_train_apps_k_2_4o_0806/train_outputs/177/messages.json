Our task is to find the smallest substring in `S` that contains all the characters from `T`. If no such substring exists, we should return an empty string. We are guaranteed that if a valid window exists, it will be unique.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can use the sliding window technique with two pointers. Here's the plan:\n\n- Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window in `S`.\n- Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer to the right until the window contains all characters of `T`.\n- Once the window is valid (contains all characters of `T`), try to shrink it from the left by moving the `left` pointer to the right, while still maintaining the validity of the window.\n- Keep track of the minimum window size found during this process.\n- Return the smallest valid window found.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\n1. Initialize a dictionary `t_count` to count occurrences of each character in `T`.\n2. Initialize a dictionary `window_count` to count occurrences of characters in the current window.\n3. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to 0.\n4. Initialize `min_length` to infinity and `min_window` to an empty string.\n5. Initialize `formed` to 0 to track how many unique characters in `T` are satisfied in the current window.\n6. Iterate with `right` from 0 to the length of `S`:\n   a. Add the character at `right` to `window_count`.\n   b. If the character is in `t_count` and its count in `window_count` matches `t_count`, increment `formed`.\n   c. While `formed` equals the number of unique characters in `T`:\n      i. Update `min_length` and `min_window` if the current window is smaller.\n      ii. Remove the character at `left` from `window_count`.\n      iii. If the character is in `t_count` and its count in `window_count` is less than `t_count`, decrement `formed`.\n      iv. Move `left` to the right.\n7. Return `min_window`.\n```\n\n### 4.

The challenge was to ensure that \"abacaba\" appears exactly once after the transformation.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:\n    - **Substring Matching**: The problem required checking if a specific substring (\"abacaba\") could be formed at various positions in the string `s`.\n    - **Handling Wildcards**: The presence of question marks meant that we had to consider them as potential matches for any character, which added complexity to the substring matching.\n    - **Counting Occurrences**: After forming \"abacaba\" at a potential position, it was crucial to count its occurrences in the entire string to ensure it appeared exactly once.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Iterative Checking**: For each possible starting position in `s`, check if \"abacaba\" can be formed by replacing question marks. This was done using a helper function `can_place_abacaba`.\n    - **Replacement and Validation**: Once a potential position was found, replace the question marks to form \"abacaba\" and validate the entire string to ensure it appears only once.\n    - **Final Transformation**: After confirming a valid transformation, replace any remaining question marks with a filler character (e.g., 'z') to complete the string.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def can_place_abacaba(s, start):\n        target = \"abacaba\"\n        for j in range(7):\n            if s[start + j] != '?' and s[start + j] != target[j]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def replace_to_form_abacaba(s, start):\n        target = \"abacaba\"\n        s_list = list(s)\n        for j in range(7):\n            if s_list[start + j] == '?':\n                s_list[start + j] = target[j]\n        return ''.join(s_list)\n\n    def count_abacaba(s):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n            if s[i:i+7] == \"abacaba\":\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\n    def fill_remaining_question_marks(s):\n        return s.replace('?', 'z')\n\n    def can_form_single_abacaba(s, n):\n        for i in range(n - 6):\n            if can_place_abacaba(s, i):\n                temp_s = replace_to_form_abacaba(s, i)\n                if count_abacaba(temp_s) == 1:\n                    return \"Yes\", fill_remaining_question_marks(temp_s)\n        return \"No\",\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of careful substring manipulation and validation, especially when dealing with wildcards. The solution was efficient due to the limited length of the string and the specific pattern we were searching for.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing at most one operation of removing a character from any position in the string and inserting it back at any other position. The key concept here was to leverage the ability to reposition characters to achieve a smaller lexicographical order.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Lexicographical Order**: Understanding how strings are compared based on character order was crucial. The task was essentially about rearranging characters to achieve the smallest possible order.\n    - **Character Repositioning**: The problem allowed for one character to be moved, which meant exploring all possible single-character moves to find the optimal configuration.\n\n    ### Strategy\n    The strategy involved iterating over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. This brute-force approach was feasible given the constraints (maximum string length of 50 and up to 50 test cases).\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` was central to the solution. It iterated over all possible character moves and checked if the resulting string was smaller than the current smallest found:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):\n        smallest_string = S\n        N = len(S)\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(N):\n                if i != j:\n                    new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]\n                    new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]\n                    if new_string < smallest_string:\n                        smallest_string = new_string\n        return smallest_string\n    ```\n\n    ### Outcome\n    The solution was effective and passed all test cases. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and lexicographical order, as well as the utility of brute-force approaches when constraints are manageable.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
