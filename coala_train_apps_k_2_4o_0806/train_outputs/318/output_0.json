    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nYou have a circular pizza with 3n slices, each of varying sizes. You and your two friends, Alice and Bob, will take turns picking slices. You pick a slice first, then Alice picks the next slice in the anti-clockwise direction, and Bob picks the next slice in the clockwise direction. This process repeats until there are no more slices left. The goal is to maximize the sum of the sizes of the slices you pick.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Since the problem involves making optimal choices at each step, a dynamic programming (DP) approach is suitable. The challenge is to select slices such that the sum of the sizes of the slices you pick is maximized.\n\n2. **Circular Array Handling**: The pizza slices are arranged in a circular manner, which means the first and last slices are adjacent. This requires special handling in the DP approach.\n\n3. **State Representation**: Use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum sum of slices you can pick from the first `i` slices, choosing `j` slices in total.\n\n4. **Transition**: For each slice, decide whether to pick it or not. If you pick it, you cannot pick the adjacent slices (due to Alice and Bob's picks). Update the DP table based on these choices.\n\n5. **Final Result**: The result will be the maximum value in the DP table after considering all slices.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a helper function `maxSlices(slices, n)` to calculate the maximum sum of slices you can pick from a linear array of slices, choosing `n` slices in total.\n2. Use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the number of slices considered and `j` is the number of slices you have picked.\n3. Initialize the DP table with base cases.\n4. Iterate over the slices and update the DP table based on whether you pick the current slice or not.\n5. Since the array is circular, call `maxSlices` twice: once excluding the first slice and once excluding the last slice.\n6. Return the maximum of the two results.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSizeSlices(self, slices: List[int]) -> int:\n        def maxSlices(slices: List[int], n: int) -> int:\n            m = len(slices)\n            dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n            \n            for i in range(1, m + 1):\n                for j in range(1, n + 1):\n                    if i == 1:\n                        dp[i][j] = slices[i - 1]\n                    else:\n                        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], (dp[i - 2][j - 1] + slices[i - 1]) if j > 0 else 0)\n            \n            return dp[m][n]\n        \n        n = len(slices) // 3\n        # Since the array is circular, we need to consider two cases:\n        # 1. Exclude the first slice\n        # 2. Exclude the last slice\n        return max(maxSlices(slices[1:], n), maxSlices(slices[:-1], n))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **maxSlices Function**: This function calculates the maximum sum of slices you can pick from a linear array of slices, choosing `n` slices in total. It uses a DP table to store intermediate results.\n- **DP Table Initialization**: The table `dp[i][j]` is initialized to store the maximum sum of slices you can pick from the first `i` slices, choosing `j` slices.\n- **DP Transition**: For each slice, decide whether to pick it or not. If you pick it, add its size to the sum of the best solution for the previous non-adjacent slice.\n- **Circular Array Handling**: Since the array is circular, the solution considers two cases: excluding the first slice and excluding the last slice. The maximum of these two results is returned.",
