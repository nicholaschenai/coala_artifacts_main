You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. \n\nIf after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.\n\nThere are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; \n\nLet's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \\textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. \n\nYou are given an array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$.

Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: \n           - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.\n           - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.\n\n        2. **Constraints**:\n           - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.\n           - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.\n\n        3. **Combinatorial Approach**:\n           - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:\n             - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.\n             - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.\n           - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.\n           - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.\n\n        4. **Modulo Operation**:\n           - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10^9 + 7\n            precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N\n\n            results = []\n            for each query (I, K):\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD\n                    count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        function precompute_factorials(N):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i from 2 to N:\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i from N-1 down to 1:\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        function C(n, k):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n            # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n            factorials, inverse_factorials = precompute_factorials(N, MOD)\n    \n            results = []\n            for I, K in queries:\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD)\n                    count_greater = pow(2, N-I, MOD)\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        def precompute_factorials(N, MOD):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i in range(2, N+1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i in range(N-1, 0, -1):\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        def C(n, k, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                queries = []\n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n                    queries.append((I, K))\n        \n                results.extend(calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries))\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently calculates the number of subsets for each query by precomputing factorials and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '3 3', '1 2', '2 1', '3 2'] Output: 0\n        2\n        2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be made to sum to zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.\n\n    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.\n\n    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.\n\n    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n        \n            sum_A = sum(A)\n            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                k = sum_A // sum_indices\n                possible = True\n                for i in range(N):\n                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                if possible:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The stack operation involves pushing elements onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case the top element is popped.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Stack Extermination**:\n   - We process each element of a subarray by either pushing it onto the stack or popping the top element if it matches the current element.\n   - A subarray is stack exterminable if the stack is empty after processing all its elements.\n\n2. **Brute Force Approach**:\n   - For each query, consider all possible subarrays of the array.\n   - For each subarray, simulate the stack operation to check if it is stack exterminable.\n   - Count the number of stack exterminable subarrays.\n\n3. **Optimization Considerations**:\n   - The brute force approach involves checking all subarrays, which can be computationally expensive.\n   - We need to ensure that the solution is efficient enough to handle the constraints, especially since the sum of all array lengths across queries is large.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction is_stack_exterminable(subarray):\n    stack = []\n    for element in subarray:\n        if stack is not empty and stack[-1] == element:\n            pop the top of the stack\n        else:\n            push element onto the stack\n    return stack is empty\n\nfunction count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(n, array):\n    count = 0\n    for start in range(n):\n        for end in range(start, n):\n            subarray = array[start:end+1]\n            if is_stack_exterminable(subarray):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\nfunction process_queries(queries):\n    results = []\n    for n, array in queries:\n        result = count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(n, array)\n        results.append(result)\n    return results\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_stack_exterminable(subarray):\n    stack = []\n    for element in subarray:\n        if stack and stack[-1] == element:\n            stack.pop()\n        else:\n            stack.append(element)\n    return len(stack) == 0\n\ndef count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(n, array):\n    count = 0\n    for start in range(n):\n        for end in range(start, n):\n            subarray = array[start:end+1]\n            if is_stack_exterminable(subarray):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef process_queries(queries):\n    results = []\n    for n, array in queries:\n        result = count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(n, array)\n        results.append(result)\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    q = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    queries = []\n    \n    for _ in range(q):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        queries.append((n, array))\n    \n    results = process_queries(queries)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution processes each query by checking all possible subarrays of the given array to determine if they are stack exterminable. The solution is straightforward but may need optimization for larger inputs due to its O(n^3) complexity."

The core concept was simulating a stack operation where elements are pushed unless the top of the stack matches the current element, in which case the top is popped. A subarray is stack exterminable if the stack is empty after processing all its elements.\n\nThe initial approach was a brute force method, iterating over all possible subarrays and checking each one for stack exterminability. This involved a nested loop structure, leading to an O(n^3) complexity for each query, which is not optimal for large inputs. However, this approach was straightforward to implement and understand, and it passed the provided test cases.\n\nIn future problems with similar constraints, optimizing the approach to reduce the complexity would be crucial. Potential optimizations could involve using dynamic programming or more advanced data structures to track stack states more efficiently. Understanding the stack operation's properties and leveraging them to prune unnecessary checks could also lead to performance improvements."

        "content": "The official solution provides a more efficient approach to solving the problem by using a trie-like structure to track the state of the stack as we process each element of the array. This approach is insightful because it avoids the need to explicitly check every possible subarray, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Trie-like Structure**: \n   - The solution uses a trie to represent different states of the stack. Each node in the trie corresponds to a unique stack configuration.\n   - The root node represents an empty stack, and each path in the trie represents a sequence of stack operations.\n\n2. **Efficient State Tracking**:\n   - As we iterate through the array, we either push the current element onto the stack or pop the top element if it matches the current element.\n   - The trie is updated accordingly to reflect these operations, allowing us to efficiently track how many times each stack configuration has been reached.\n\n3. **Counting Exterminable Subarrays**:\n   - The solution uses combinatorial counting to determine the number of exterminable subarrays. It calculates the number of ways to choose pairs of indices that lead to the same stack configuration, which indicates a stack exterminable subarray.\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - This approach significantly reduces the time complexity compared to the brute force method, as it avoids redundant calculations by leveraging the trie structure.\n\nThe official solution is a great example of how data structures like tries can be used to efficiently solve problems involving state transitions, especially when dealing with large input sizes. This approach is both elegant and efficient, making it a valuable technique for similar problems in the future."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes a number of queries. For each query, it reads an integer representing the size of an array, followed by the array elements themselves. It then processes each query to determine the number of subarrays that can be reduced to an empty stack by repeatedly removing adjacent pairs of equal elements. The results for each query are collected and printed to the standard output.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a sequence of operations on a stack results in an empty stack, which is a common problem in computer science related to stack operations and data structure manipulation. It is particularly relevant in competitive programming and algorithm design, where understanding the behavior of stack operations can help solve problems related to sequence processing, such as matching parentheses, evaluating expressions, or simulating processes that involve push and pop operations. Additionally, this problem is useful for understanding how to efficiently count subarrays that meet certain criteria, which is a common task in data analysis and algorithm optimization."
