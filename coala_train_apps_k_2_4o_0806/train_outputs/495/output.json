    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. We can smash two rocks together, and the result depends on their weights. If the weights are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If they are different, the smaller rock is destroyed, and the larger rock's weight is reduced by the smaller rock's weight. We repeat this process until at most one rock is left. Our goal is to find the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock, which could be zero if all rocks are destroyed.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   This problem can be thought of as a variation of the partition problem, where we want to split the stones into two groups with the smallest possible difference in their total weights. The key idea is to use dynamic programming to find the closest possible sum to half of the total weight of all stones. This will help us determine the smallest possible weight of the last stone.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.\n   2. Initialize a boolean array `dp` of size (total_weight // 2 + 1) with False values.\n   3. Set dp[0] to True, as a sum of 0 is always possible.\n   4. For each stone weight:\n      a. Iterate from total_weight // 2 down to the stone weight:\n         i. Update dp[j] to be True if dp[j - stone] is True.\n   5. Find the largest j for which dp[j] is True.\n   6. The smallest possible weight of the last stone is total_weight - 2 * j.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Calculate the total weight of all stones\n        total_weight = sum(stones)\n        \n        # Initialize a boolean array dp to track possible sums\n        dp = [False] * (total_weight // 2 + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # A sum of 0 is always possible\n        \n        # Iterate over each stone\n        for stone in stones:\n            # Update the dp array from back to front\n            for j in range(total_weight // 2, stone - 1, -1):\n                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n        \n        # Find the largest j for which dp[j] is True\n        for j in range(total_weight // 2, -1, -1):\n            if dp[j]:\n                # The smallest possible weight of the last stone\n                return total_weight - 2 * j\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the closest possible sum to half of the total weight, which helps determine the smallest possible weight of the last stone.",
