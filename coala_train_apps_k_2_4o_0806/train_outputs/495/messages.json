If the weights of the rocks are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If the weights are different, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. We need to determine the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock, or 0 if no rocks are left.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nThe problem is similar to a partition problem where we want to split the stones into two groups such that the difference between the sums of the two groups is minimized. This is because smashing two stones is equivalent to reducing the total weight by twice the weight of the smaller group.\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.\n2. Use dynamic programming to find the maximum possible sum of a subset of stones that does not exceed half of the total weight.\n3. The smallest possible weight of the last stone is the difference between the total weight and twice this maximum subset sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.\n2. Initialize a boolean DP array `dp` of size `total_weight // 2 + 1` with `dp[0] = True`.\n3. For each stone weight:\n   - Iterate backwards through the DP array from `total_weight // 2` to the stone weight.\n   - Update `dp[j]` to `True` if `dp[j - stone]` is `True`.\n4. Find the largest `j` for which `dp[j]` is `True`.\n5. Return `total_weight - 2 * j`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Calculate the total weight of all stones\n        total_weight = sum(stones)\n        \n        # The target is to find the maximum weight we can achieve that is <= total_weight // 2\n        target = total_weight // 2\n        \n        # Initialize a DP array where dp[i] means whether a sum of i can be achieved\n        dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # Base case: a sum of 0 is always achievable\n        \n        # Process each stone\n        for stone in stones:\n            # Update the dp array from back to front\n            for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n        \n        # Find the largest j for which dp[j] is True\n        for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n            if dp[j]:\n                # The smallest possible weight of the last stone\n                return total_weight - 2 * j\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the optimal way to partition the stones into two groups with minimal difference in their total weights. The time complexity is O(n * total_weight), where n is the number of stones."

programming}\n\n    \\key{Dynamic programming}\n    is a technique that combines the correctness\n    of complete search and the efficiency\n    of greedy algorithms.\n    Dynamic programming can be applied if the\n    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems\n    that can be solved independently.\n\n    There are two uses for dynamic programming:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item\n    \\key{Finding an optimal solution}:\n    We want to find a solution that is\n    as large as possible or as small as possible.\n    \\item\n    \\key{Counting the number of solutions}:\n    We want to calculate the total number of\n    possible solutions.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    We will first see how dynamic programming can\n    be used to find an optimal solution,\n    and then we will use the same idea for\n    counting the solutions.\n\n    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone\n    in every competitive programmer's career.\n    While the basic idea is simple,\n    the challenge is how to apply\n    dynamic programming to different problems.\n    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems\n    that are a good starting point.\n\n    \\section{Coin problem}\n\n    We first focus on a problem that we\n    have already seen in Chapter 6:\n    Given a set of coin values $\\texttt{coins} = \\{c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_k\\}$\n    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to\n    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.\n\n    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a\n    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest\n    possible coin.\n    The greedy algorithm works, for example,\n    when the coins are the euro coins,\n    but in the general case the greedy algorithm\n    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.\n\n    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently\n    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm\n    works for any coin set.\n    The dynamic programming\n    algorithm is based on a recursive function\n    that goes through all possibilities how to\n    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.\n    However, the dynamic programming\n    algorithm is efficient because\n    it uses \\emph{memoization} and\n    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Recursive formulation}\n\n    The idea in dynamic programming is to\n    formulate the problem recursively so\n    that the solution to the problem can be\n    calculated from solutions to smaller\n    subproblems.\n    In the coin problem, a natural recursive\n    problem is as follows:\n    what is the smallest number of coins\n    required to form a sum $x$?\n\n    Let $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    denote the minimum\n    number of coins required for a sum $x$.\n    The values of the function depend on the\n    values of the coins.\n    For example, if $\\texttt{coins} = \\{1,3,4\\}$,\n    the first values of the function are as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    \\texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    For example, $\\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,\n    because at least 3 coins are needed\n    to form the sum 10.\n    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.\n\n    The essential property of $\\texttt{solve}$ is\n    that its values can be\n    recursively calculated from its smaller values.\n    The idea is to focus on the \\emph{first}\n    coin that we choose for the sum.\n    For example, in the above scenario,\n    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.\n    If we first choose coin 1,\n    the remaining task is to form the sum 9\n    using the minimum number of coins,\n    which is a subproblem of the original problem.\n    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.\n    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula\n    to calculate the minimum number of coins:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\min( & \\texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).\n    \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case of the recursion is $\\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    For example,\n    \\[ \\texttt{solve}(10) = \\texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \\texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \\texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\\]\n\n    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function\n    that calculates the minimum number of\n    coins needed to form a sum $x$:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n                   \\infty               & x < 0\\\\\n                   0               & x = 0\\\\\n                   \\min_{c \\in \\texttt{coins}} \\texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n\n    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\\infty$,\n    because it is impossible to form a negative\n    sum of money.\n    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through\n    all possibilities how to choose the first coin\n    of the sum.\n\n    Once a recursive function that solves the problem\n    has been found,\n    we can directly implement a solution in C++\n    (the constant \\texttt{INF} denotes infinity):\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Still, this function is not efficient,\n    because there may be an exponential number of ways\n    to construct the sum.\n    However, next we will see how to make the\n    function efficient using a technique called memoization.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Using memoization}\n\n    \\index{memoization}\n\n    The idea of dynamic programming is to use\n    \\key{memoization} to efficiently calculate\n    values of a recursive function.\n    This means that the values of the function\n    are stored in an array after calculating them.\n    For each parameter, the value of the function\n    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,\n    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.\n\n    In this problem, we use arrays\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    bool ready[N];\n    int value[N];\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    where $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates\n    whether the value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,\n    and if it is, $\\texttt{value}[x]$\n    contains this value.\n    The constant $N$ has been chosen so\n    that all required values fit in the arrays.\n\n    Now the function can be efficiently\n    implemented as follows:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        if (ready[x]) return value[x];\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        value[x] = best;\n        ready[x] = true;\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function handles the base cases\n    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.\n    Then the function checks from\n    $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ if\n    $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored\n    in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    and if it is, the function directly returns it.\n    Otherwise the function calculates the value\n    of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    recursively and stores it in $\\texttt{value}[x]$.\n\n    This function works efficiently,\n    because the answer for each parameter $x$\n    is calculated recursively only once.\n    After a value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the\n    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.\n    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(nk)$,\n    where $n$ is the target sum and $k$ is the number of coins.\n\n    Note that we can also \\emph{iteratively}\n    construct the array \\texttt{value} using\n    a loop that simply calculates all the values\n    of $\\texttt{solve}$ for parameters $0 \\ldots n\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Divide and Conquer DP\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Divide and Conquer DP\n\n    Divide and Conquer is a dynamic programming optimization.\n\n    ### Preconditions\n    Some dynamic programming problems have a recurrence of this form: \n\n    $$\n    dp(i, j) = \\min_{0 \\leq k \\leq j} \\\\{ dp(i - 1, k - 1) + C(k, j) \\\\}\n    $$\n\n    where $C(k, j)$ is a cost function and $dp(i, j) = 0$ when $j \\lt 0$. \n\n    Say $0 \\leq i \\lt m$ and $0 \\leq j \\lt n$, and evaluating $C$ takes $O(1)$\n    time. Then the straightforward evaluation of the above recurrence is $O(m n^2)$. There\n    are $m \\times n$ states, and $n$ transitions for each state.\n\n    Let $opt(i, j)$ be the value of $k$ that minimizes the above expression. Assuming that the \n    cost function satisfies the quadrangle inequality, we can show that \n    $opt(i, j) \\leq opt(i, j + 1)$ for all $i, j$. This is known as the _monotonicity condition_. \n    Then, we can apply divide and conquer DP. The optimal\n    \"splitting point\" for a fixed $i$ increases as $j$ increases.\n\n    This lets us solve for all states more efficiently. Say we compute $opt(i, j)$\n    for some fixed $i$ and $j$. Then for any $j' < j$ we know that $opt(i, j') \\leq opt(i, j)$.\n    This means when computing $opt(i, j')$, we don't have to consider as many\n    splitting points!\n\n    To minimize the runtime, we apply the idea behind divide and conquer. First,\n    compute $opt(i, n / 2)$. Then, compute $opt(i, n / 4)$, knowing that it is less\n    than or equal to $opt(i, n / 2)$ and $opt(i, 3 n / 4)$ knowing that it is\n    greater than or equal to $opt(i, n / 2)$. By recursively keeping track of the\n    lower and upper bounds on $opt$, we reach a $O(m n \\log n)$ runtime. Each\n    possible value of $opt(i, j)$ only appears in $\\log n$ different nodes.\n\n    Note that it doesn't matter how \"balanced\" $opt(i, j)$ is. Across a fixed\n    level, each value of $k$ is used at most twice, and there are at most $\\log n$\n    levels.\n\n    ## Generic implementation\n\n    Even though implementation varies based on problem, here's a fairly generic\n    template.\n    The function `compute` computes one row $i$ of states `dp_cur`, given the previous row $i-1$ of states `dp_before`.\n    It has to be called with `compute(0, n-1, 0, n-1)`. The function `solve` computes `m` rows and returns the result.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=divide_and_conquer_dp}\n    int m, n;\n    vector<long long> dp_before(n), dp_cur(n);\n\n    long long C(int i, int j);\n\n    // compute dp_cur[l], ... dp_cur[r] (inclusive)\n    void compute(int l, int r, int optl, int optr) {\n        if (l > r)\n            return;\n\n        int mid = (l + r) >> 1;\n        pair<long long, int> best = {LLONG_MAX, -1};\n\n        for (int k = optl; k <= min(mid, optr); k++) {\n            best = min(best, {(k ? dp_before[k - 1] : 0) + C(k, mid), k});\n        }\n\n        dp_cur[mid] = best.first;\n        int opt = best.second;\n\n        compute(l, mid - 1, optl, opt);\n        compute(mid + 1, r, opt, optr);\n    }\n\n    int solve() {\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n            dp_before[i] = C(0, i);\n\n        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {\n            compute(0, n - 1, 0, n - 1);\n            dp_before = dp_cur;\n        }\n\n        return dp_before[n - 1];\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Things to look out for\n\n    The greatest difficulty with Divide and Conquer DP problems is proving the\n    monotonicity of $opt$. One special case where this is true is when the cost function satisfies the quadrangle inequality, i.e., $C(a, c) + C(b, d) \\leq C(a, d) + C(b, c)$ for all $a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d$. \n    Many Divide and Conquer DP problems can also be solved with the Convex Hull trick or vice-versa. It is useful to know and understand\n    both!\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "The problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after smashing them together is essentially a variation of the partition problem. The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n   - Both my solution and the official solution use dynamic programming to solve the problem. The idea is to track possible sums of stone weights that can be achieved by selecting different subsets of stones.\n\n2. **State Representation:**\n   - My approach used a boolean array `dp` to represent possible sums up to half of the total weight. The official solution uses a set `dp` to dynamically store all possible sums that can be achieved as we iterate through the stones.\n\n3. **Efficiency:**\n   - The official solution is more elegant and concise. It uses set operations to update possible sums, which simplifies the code and potentially reduces the space complexity by not limiting the sums to half the total weight initially.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Both solutions ultimately aim to find the sum closest to half of the total weight, as this minimizes the difference between the two groups. The official solution calculates the minimum difference directly using a set comprehension.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution is insightful in its use of set operations to dynamically track possible sums, which simplifies the implementation. This approach is both elegant and efficient, as it avoids the need for a fixed-size array and leverages Python's set operations for concise updates. This experience highlights the importance of considering different data structures (like sets) for dynamic programming problems, especially when dealing with subset sums or partitioning problems."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThe function calculates the smallest possible weight of the last remaining stone after repeatedly smashing two stones together, where the stones are represented by a list of integers. It first computes the total weight of all stones and initializes a boolean array to track possible sums up to half of the total weight. The function iterates over each stone, updating the array to reflect which sums can be achieved by including the current stone. It then finds the largest achievable sum that is less than or equal to half of the total weight. Finally, it returns the difference between the total weight and twice this largest achievable sum, which represents the smallest possible weight of the last stone.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to minimize the remaining weight after a series of pairwise operations that reduce weights, such as in optimization problems involving resource allocation or load balancing. The problem is analogous to partitioning a set into two subsets with minimal difference in their sums, which is a common problem in computer science and operations research. Understanding this solution can help in designing algorithms for similar problems where you need to balance or minimize differences, such as in scheduling tasks, dividing workloads, or even in game theory where you need to minimize losses or maximize gains through strategic pairings."
