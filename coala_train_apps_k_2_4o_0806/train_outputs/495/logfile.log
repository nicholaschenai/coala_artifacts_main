INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. We can repeatedly smash two rocks together. If the weights of the rocks are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If the weights are different, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. We need to determine the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock, or 0 if no rocks are left.

## Conceptual Solution

The problem is similar to a partition problem where we want to split the stones into two groups such that the difference between the sums of the two groups is minimized. This is because smashing two stones is equivalent to reducing the total weight by twice the weight of the smaller group.

1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.
2. Use dynamic programming to find the maximum possible sum of a subset of stones that does not exceed half of the total weight.
3. The smallest possible weight of the last stone is the difference between the total weight and twice this maximum subset sum.

## Pseudocode

1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.
2. Initialize a boolean DP array `dp` of size `total_weight // 2 + 1` with `dp[0] = True`.
3. For each stone weight:
   - Iterate backwards through the DP array from `total_weight // 2` to the stone weight.
   - Update `dp[j]` to `True` if `dp[j - stone]` is `True`.
4. Find the largest `j` for which `dp[j]` is `True`.
5. Return `total_weight - 2 * j`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        # Calculate the total weight of all stones
        total_weight = sum(stones)
        
        # The target is to find the maximum weight we can achieve that is <= total_weight // 2
        target = total_weight // 2
        
        # Initialize a DP array where dp[i] means whether a sum of i can be achieved
        dp = [False] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: a sum of 0 is always achievable
        
        # Process each stone
        for stone in stones:
            # Update the dp array from back to front
            for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]
        
        # Find the largest j for which dp[j] is True
        for j in range(target, -1, -1):
            if dp[j]:
                # The smallest possible weight of the last stone
                return total_weight - 2 * j
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the optimal way to partition the stones into two groups with minimal difference in their total weights. The time complexity is O(n * total_weight), where n is the number of stones.

    Part: 1/2
    \chapter{Dynamic programming}

    \index{dynamic programming}

    \key{Dynamic programming}
    is a technique that combines the correctness
    of complete search and the efficiency
    of greedy algorithms.
    Dynamic programming can be applied if the
    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems
    that can be solved independently.

    There are two uses for dynamic programming:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \key{Finding an optimal solution}:
    We want to find a solution that is
    as large as possible or as small as possible.
    \item
    \key{Counting the number of solutions}:
    We want to calculate the total number of
    possible solutions.
    \end{itemize}

    We will first see how dynamic programming can
    be used to find an optimal solution,
    and then we will use the same idea for
    counting the solutions.

    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone
    in every competitive programmer's career.
    While the basic idea is simple,
    the challenge is how to apply
    dynamic programming to different problems.
    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems
    that are a good starting point.

    \section{Coin problem}

    We first focus on a problem that we
    have already seen in Chapter 6:
    Given a set of coin values $\texttt{coins} = \{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k\}$
    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to
    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.

    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a
    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest
    possible coin.
    The greedy algorithm works, for example,
    when the coins are the euro coins,
    but in the general case the greedy algorithm
    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.

    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently
    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm
    works for any coin set.
    The dynamic programming
    algorithm is based on a recursive function
    that goes through all possibilities how to
    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.
    However, the dynamic programming
    algorithm is efficient because
    it uses \emph{memoization} and
    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.

    \subsubsection{Recursive formulation}

    The idea in dynamic programming is to
    formulate the problem recursively so
    that the solution to the problem can be
    calculated from solutions to smaller
    subproblems.
    In the coin problem, a natural recursive
    problem is as follows:
    what is the smallest number of coins
    required to form a sum $x$?

    Let $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    denote the minimum
    number of coins required for a sum $x$.
    The values of the function depend on the
    values of the coins.
    For example, if $\texttt{coins} = \{1,3,4\}$,
    the first values of the function are as follows:

    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\
    \texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,
    because at least 3 coins are needed
    to form the sum 10.
    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.

    The essential property of $\texttt{solve}$ is
    that its values can be
    recursively calculated from its smaller values.
    The idea is to focus on the \emph{first}
    coin that we choose for the sum.
    For example, in the above scenario,
    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.
    If we first choose coin 1,
    the remaining task is to form the sum 9
    using the minimum number of coins,
    which is a subproblem of the original problem.
    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.
    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula
    to calculate the minimum number of coins:
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \texttt{solve}(x) = \min( & \texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case of the recursion is $\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    For example,
    \[ \texttt{solve}(10) = \texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\]

    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function
    that calculates the minimum number of
    coins needed to form a sum $x$:
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{solve}(x) = \begin{cases}
                   \infty               & x < 0\\
                   0               & x = 0\\
                   \min_{c \in \texttt{coins}} \texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\infty$,
    because it is impossible to form a negative
    sum of money.
    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through
    all possibilities how to choose the first coin
    of the sum.

    Once a recursive function that solves the problem
    has been found,
    we can directly implement a solution in C++
    (the constant \texttt{INF} denotes infinity):

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Still, this function is not efficient,
    because there may be an exponential number of ways
    to construct the sum.
    However, next we will see how to make the
    function efficient using a technique called memoization.

    \subsubsection{Using memoization}

    \index{memoization}

    The idea of dynamic programming is to use
    \key{memoization} to efficiently calculate
    values of a recursive function.
    This means that the values of the function
    are stored in an array after calculating them.
    For each parameter, the value of the function
    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,
    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.

    In this problem, we use arrays
    \begin{lstlisting}
    bool ready[N];
    int value[N];
    \end{lstlisting}

    where $\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates
    whether the value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,
    and if it is, $\texttt{value}[x]$
    contains this value.
    The constant $N$ has been chosen so
    that all required values fit in the arrays.

    Now the function can be efficiently
    implemented as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        if (ready[x]) return value[x];
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        value[x] = best;
        ready[x] = true;
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function handles the base cases
    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.
    Then the function checks from
    $\texttt{ready}[x]$ if
    $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored
    in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    and if it is, the function directly returns it.
    Otherwise the function calculates the value
    of $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    recursively and stores it in $\texttt{value}[x]$.

    This function works efficiently,
    because the answer for each parameter $x$
    is calculated recursively only once.
    After a value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the
    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.
    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(nk)$,
    where $n$ is the target sum and $k$ is the number of coins.

    Note that we can also \emph{iteratively}
    construct the array \texttt{value} using
    a loop that simply calculates all the values
    of $\texttt{solve}$ for parameters $0 \ldots n

    Title: Divide and Conquer DP
    Part: 1/1
    # Divide and Conquer DP

    Divide and Conquer is a dynamic programming optimization.

    ### Preconditions
    Some dynamic programming problems have a recurrence of this form: 

    $$
    dp(i, j) = \min_{0 \leq k \leq j} \\{ dp(i - 1, k - 1) + C(k, j) \\}
    $$

    where $C(k, j)$ is a cost function and $dp(i, j) = 0$ when $j \lt 0$. 

    Say $0 \leq i \lt m$ and $0 \leq j \lt n$, and evaluating $C$ takes $O(1)$
    time. Then the straightforward evaluation of the above recurrence is $O(m n^2)$. There
    are $m \times n$ states, and $n$ transitions for each state.

    Let $opt(i, j)$ be the value of $k$ that minimizes the above expression. Assuming that the 
    cost function satisfies the quadrangle inequality, we can show that 
    $opt(i, j) \leq opt(i, j + 1)$ for all $i, j$. This is known as the _monotonicity condition_. 
    Then, we can apply divide and conquer DP. The optimal
    "splitting point" for a fixed $i$ increases as $j$ increases.

    This lets us solve for all states more efficiently. Say we compute $opt(i, j)$
    for some fixed $i$ and $j$. Then for any $j' < j$ we know that $opt(i, j') \leq opt(i, j)$.
    This means when computing $opt(i, j')$, we don't have to consider as many
    splitting points!

    To minimize the runtime, we apply the idea behind divide and conquer. First,
    compute $opt(i, n / 2)$. Then, compute $opt(i, n / 4)$, knowing that it is less
    than or equal to $opt(i, n / 2)$ and $opt(i, 3 n / 4)$ knowing that it is
    greater than or equal to $opt(i, n / 2)$. By recursively keeping track of the
    lower and upper bounds on $opt$, we reach a $O(m n \log n)$ runtime. Each
    possible value of $opt(i, j)$ only appears in $\log n$ different nodes.

    Note that it doesn't matter how "balanced" $opt(i, j)$ is. Across a fixed
    level, each value of $k$ is used at most twice, and there are at most $\log n$
    levels.

    ## Generic implementation

    Even though implementation varies based on problem, here's a fairly generic
    template.
    The function `compute` computes one row $i$ of states `dp_cur`, given the previous row $i-1$ of states `dp_before`.
    It has to be called with `compute(0, n-1, 0, n-1)`. The function `solve` computes `m` rows and returns the result.

    ```{.cpp file=divide_and_conquer_dp}
    int m, n;
    vector<long long> dp_before(n), dp_cur(n);

    long long C(int i, int j);

    // compute dp_cur[l], ... dp_cur[r] (inclusive)
    void compute(int l, int r, int optl, int optr) {
        if (l > r)
            return;

        int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
        pair<long long, int> best = {LLONG_MAX, -1};

        for (int k = optl; k <= min(mid, optr); k++) {
            best = min(best, {(k ? dp_before[k - 1] : 0) + C(k, mid), k});
        }

        dp_cur[mid] = best.first;
        int opt = best.second;

        compute(l, mid - 1, optl, opt);
        compute(mid + 1, r, opt, optr);
    }

    int solve() {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            dp_before[i] = C(0, i);

        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            compute(0, n - 1, 0, n - 1);
            dp_before = dp_cur;
        }

        return dp_before[n - 1];
    }
    ```

    ### Things to look out for

    The greatest difficulty with Divide and Conquer DP problems is proving the
    monotonicity of $opt$. One special case where this is true is when the cost function satisfies the quadrangle inequality, i.e., $C(a, c) + C(b, d) \leq C(a, d) + C(b, c)$ for all $a \leq b \leq c \leq d$. 
    Many Divide and Conquer DP problems can also be solved with the Convex Hull trick or vice-versa. It is useful to know and understand
    both!

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. We can smash two rocks together, and the result depends on their weights. If the weights are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If they are different, the smaller rock is destroyed, and the larger rock's weight is reduced by the smaller rock's weight. We repeat this process until at most one rock is left. Our goal is to find the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock, which could be zero if all rocks are destroyed.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   This problem can be thought of as a variation of the partition problem, where we want to split the stones into two groups with the smallest possible difference in their total weights. The key idea is to use dynamic programming to find the closest possible sum to half of the total weight of all stones. This will help us determine the smallest possible weight of the last stone.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] In tackling the problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after repeatedly smashing stones together, I identified it as a variation of the partition problem. The core concept here is to split the stones into two groups with the smallest possible difference in their total weights. This is akin to minimizing the difference between two subsets, which is a common dynamic programming problem.

The successful strategy involved using a dynamic programming approach to determine the closest possible sum to half of the total weight of all stones. By maintaining a boolean array `dp` that tracks which sums are possible with the given stones, I was able to efficiently compute the smallest possible weight of the last stone. The key was to iterate over the stones and update the `dp` array from back to front to avoid overwriting values prematurely.

The solution was implemented in Python using a dynamic programming table, and it passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it reduces the problem to a manageable size by focusing on half of the total weight. This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming in solving subset sum and partition-related problems.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {0}
        total = sum(stones)
        for stone in stones:
            dp |= {_sum + stone for _sum in dp}
        return min(abs(total - _sum - _sum) for _sum in dp)

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] The problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after smashing them together is essentially a variation of the partition problem. The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized.

### Key Insights:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Both my solution and the official solution use dynamic programming to solve the problem. The idea is to track possible sums of stone weights that can be achieved by selecting different subsets of stones.

2. **State Representation:**
   - My approach used a boolean array `dp` to represent possible sums up to half of the total weight. The official solution uses a set `dp` to dynamically store all possible sums that can be achieved as we iterate through the stones.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The official solution is more elegant and concise. It uses set operations to update possible sums, which simplifies the code and potentially reduces the space complexity by not limiting the sums to half the total weight initially.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Both solutions ultimately aim to find the sum closest to half of the total weight, as this minimizes the difference between the two groups. The official solution calculates the minimum difference directly using a set comprehension.

### Reflection:

The official solution is insightful in its use of set operations to dynamically track possible sums, which simplifies the implementation. This approach is both elegant and efficient, as it avoids the need for a fixed-size array and leverages Python's set operations for concise updates. This experience highlights the importance of considering different data structures (like sets) for dynamic programming problems, especially when dealing with subset sums or partitioning problems.

You are a helpful assistant that extracts important information from problems and solutions to aid in searchability and education.

## Instructions
- Read through the problem and solution carefully.
- Reason out, step by step, in what scenarios this knowledge would be useful.
- Focus on general patterns and situations to help connect this knowledge to new situations.
- Then, include a list of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair.

## Response format
Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"scenarios": {"description": "In what scenarios will this knowledge be useful? Answer in a paragraph.", "title": "Scenarios", "type": "string"}, "keywords": {"description": "List of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Keywords", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["scenarios", "keywords"]}
```

[Problem]
    We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.
    Each turn, we choose any two rocksÂ and smash them together.Â  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.Â  The result of this smash is:

    If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
    If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.

    At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.Â  Return the smallest possible weight of this stone (the weight isÂ 0 if there are no stones left.)
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 
    We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
    we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
    we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
    we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.

Â 
    Note:

    1 <= stones.length <= 30
    1 <= stones[i] <= 100

    from typing import List

    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            # Calculate the total weight of all stones
            total_weight = sum(stones)
        
            # Initialize a boolean array dp to track possible sums
            dp = [False] * (total_weight // 2 + 1)
            dp[0] = True  # A sum of 0 is always possible
        
            # Iterate over each stone
            for stone in stones:
                # Update the dp array from back to front
                for j in range(total_weight // 2, stone - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]
        
            # Find the largest j for which dp[j] is True
            for j in range(total_weight // 2, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    # The smallest possible weight of the last stone
                    return total_weight - 2 * j
