    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine how many times students from the first, second, and third years all arrive on campus at the same time over a period of `n` days. Each year group has a different frequency of visiting the campus: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on campus simultaneously within the given number of days.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the common times when all three groups of students are on campus. This happens at the least common multiple (LCM) of their visit intervals `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\n2. **Calculate LCM**: The LCM of three numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three. This will give us the interval at which all three groups are on campus together.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this event occurs in `n` days. Since each day has 24 hours, the total number of hours in `n` days is `24 * n`. The number of times all groups are on campus together is the total hours divided by the LCM.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. For each test case:\n   - Read `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`.\n   - Calculate the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n   - Calculate the total number of hours in `n` days: `total_hours = 24 * n`.\n   - Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together: `count = total_hours // LCM`.\n   - Output `count`.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\ndef lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n        index += 3\n        \n        # Calculate LCM of x, y, z\n        lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        \n        # Calculate total hours in N days\n        total_hours = 24 * N\n        \n        # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together\n        count = total_hours // lcm_xyz\n        \n        results.append(count)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **GCD and LCM Functions**: We use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD), which helps in calculating the LCM.\n- **LCM of Three Numbers**: We compute the LCM of three numbers by first finding the LCM of two numbers and then using that result to find the LCM with the third number.\n- **Main Logic**: For each test case, we calculate the total number of hours in `n` days and divide it by the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z` to find how many times all groups are on campus together. This result is stored and printed for each test case.",
