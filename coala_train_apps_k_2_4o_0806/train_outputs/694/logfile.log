INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine how many times all first-year, second-year, and third-year students are present on campus together over a period of `N` days. First-year students come every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on the same day over `N` days.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the number of times all three groups of students are on campus together. This happens when the time is a common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Use Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The key is to find the least common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`. This LCM will tell us the interval at which all three groups are on campus together.

3. **Calculate the Number of Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this interval fits into the total hours over `N` days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total hours over `N` days is `24 * N`.

4. **Iterate Over Test Cases**: We need to repeat the above steps for each test case provided.

## Pseudocode

```
function gcd(a, b):
    while b is not 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

function lcm(a, b):
    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

function lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

function calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z):
    total_hours = 24 * N
    interval = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
    return total_hours // interval

read T
for each test case:
    read N
    read x, y, z
    result = calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z)
    print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
# Helper function to calculate the greatest common divisor
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Helper function to calculate the least common multiple
def lcm(a, b):
    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

# Function to calculate the least common multiple of three numbers
def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

# Main function to calculate the number of times all students are present
def calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z):
    total_hours = 24 * N
    interval = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
    return total_hours // interval

# Read number of test cases
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1

# Process each test case
results = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    x, y, z = map(int, data[index + 1:index + 4])
    index += 4
    result = calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z)
    results.append(result)

# Output results for each test case
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to calculate the number of times all students are present together, and outputs the result for each test case. The use of LCM ensures that we correctly determine the intervals at which all groups are present simultaneously.

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the `main()` function, which contains the logic for reading input and producing output, is not being executed. In Python scripts, especially when using functions, it's crucial to ensure that the main logic is called when the script is executed.

        ### Steps to Fix the Issue

        1. **Ensure Execution of Main Logic**: The `main()` function should be called explicitly at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

        2. **Review Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly and that the indices are being managed properly, especially when converting from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

        3. **Output the Results**: Ensure that the results are being printed correctly after processing each test case.

        ### Revised Code

        ```python
        def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
            # Initialize scores for all students
            scores = [10] * N
    
            # Process each question
            for i, j, k in questions:
                for student in range(i, j + 1):
                    scores[student] *= k
    
            # Calculate the mean of the scores
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
            return mean_score

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                M = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                questions = []
                for _ in range(M):
                    i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
                    j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
                    k = int(data[index + 2])
                    index += 3
                    questions.append((i, j, k))
        
                result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Ensure the main function is called
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes

        - **Calling `main()`**: Added a check to call `main()` when the script is executed. This ensures that the input is processed and output is generated.
        - **Input Handling**: The input reading and processing logic remains the same, ensuring that indices are correctly converted from 1-based to 0-based.
        - **Output**: The results are collected in a list and printed after processing all test cases. This ensures that the output is generated as expected.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with given complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    The core concept here was to efficiently update the scores of students over a range of indices and then compute the mean of these scores. The challenge was to handle potentially large input sizes, which required careful management of input reading and processing.

    Initially, the code failed to produce output because the `main()` function was not being called. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by adding a check to call `main()` when the script is executed. This is a common pattern in Python scripts to ensure that the main logic is executed.

    The solution involved:
    - Initializing an array to store scores for each student.
    - Iterating over each question and updating the scores for the specified range of students.
    - Calculating the total score and using floor division to find the mean.

    This problem reinforced the importance of handling input/output correctly and ensuring that the main logic is executed. It also highlighted the need to efficiently manage operations over potentially large datasets, which is a common requirement in competitive programming.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine how many times students from the first, second, and third years all arrive on campus at the same time over a period of `n` days. Each year group has a different frequency of visiting the campus: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on campus simultaneously within the given number of days.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the common times when all three groups of students are on campus. This happens at the least common multiple (LCM) of their visit intervals `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Calculate LCM**: The LCM of three numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three. This will give us the interval at which all three groups are on campus together.

3. **Determine the Number of Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this event occurs in `n` days. Since each day has 24 hours, the total number of hours in `n` days is `24 * n`. The number of times all groups are on campus together is the total hours divided by the LCM.

### Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`.
   - Calculate the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
   - Calculate the total number of hours in `n` days: `total_hours = 24 * n`.
   - Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together: `count = total_hours // LCM`.
   - Output `count`.

### Python Code

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

### Explanation

- **GCD and LCM Functions**: We use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD), which helps in calculating the LCM.
- **LCM of Three Numbers**: We compute the LCM of three numbers by first finding the LCM of two numbers and then using that result to find the LCM with the third number.
- **Main Logic**: For each test case, we calculate the total number of hours in `n` days and divide it by the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z` to find how many times all groups are on campus together. This result is stored and printed for each test case.

 ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine how many times students from the first, second, and third years all arrive on campus at the same time over a period of `n` days. Each year group has a different frequency of visiting the campus: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on campus simultaneously within the given number of days.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the common times when all three groups of students are on campus. This happens at the least common multiple (LCM) of their visit intervals `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Calculate LCM**: The LCM of three numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three. This will give us the interval at which all three groups are on campus together.

3. **Determine the Number of Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this event occurs in `n` days. Since each day has 24 hours, the total number of hours in `n` days is `24 * n`. The number of times all groups are on campus together is the total hours divided by the LCM.

### Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`.
   - Calculate the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
   - Calculate the total number of hours in `n` days: `total_hours = 24 * n`.
   - Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together: `count = total_hours // LCM`.
   - Output `count`.

### Python Code

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

        lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        
        # Calculate total hours in N days
        total_hours = 24 * N
        
        # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together

We need to determine how many times students from the first, second, and third years all arrive on campus at the same time over a period of `n` days. Each year group has a different frequency of visiting the campus: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on campus simultaneously within the given number of days.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the common times when all three groups of students are on campus. This happens at the least common multiple (LCM) of their visit intervals `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Calculate LCM**: The LCM of three numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three. This will give us the interval at which all three groups are on campus together.

3. **Determine the Number of Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this event occurs in `n` days. Since each day has 24 hours, the total number of hours in `n` days is `24 * n`. The number of times all groups are on campus together is the total hours divided by the LCM.

### Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`.
   - Calculate the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
   - Calculate the total number of hours in `n` days: `total_hours = 24 * n`.
   - Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together: `count = total_hours // LCM`.
   - Output `count`.

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called, which is a common issue when the function is defined but not executed. In competitive programming or script-based environments, the main function or logic should be executed directly to ensure the program runs as expected.

### Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Ensure Execution**: The `solve()` function should be called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed when the script runs.

2. **Check Input/Output**: Ensure that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()` which is appropriate for reading all input at once in a competitive programming environment.

3. **Verify Logic**: The logic for calculating the LCM and determining the number of times all groups are on campus together seems correct, but we should ensure that the function is executed to see the results.

### Revised Python Code

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])
        index += 3
        
        # Calculate LCM of x, y, z
        lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        
        # Calculate total hours in N days
        total_hours = 24 * N
        
        # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together
        count = total_hours // lcm_xyz
        
        results.append(count)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure that the function is executed when the script runs.
- **Input/Output Handling**: The input and output handling remains the same, using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and `print()` to output results.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function will now be executed and produce the expected results.

### Explanation

- **GCD and LCM Functions**: We use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD), which helps in calculating the LCM.
- **LCM of Three Numbers**: We compute the LCM of three numbers by first finding the LCM of two numbers and then using that result to find the LCM with the third number.
- **Main Logic**: For each test case, we calculate the total number of hours in `n` days and divide it by the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z` to find how many times all groups are on campus together. This result is stored and printed for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called, which is a common issue when the function is defined but not executed. In competitive programming or script-based environments, the main function or logic should be executed directly to ensure the program runs as expected.

### Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Ensure Execution**: The `solve()` function should be called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed when the script runs.

2. **Check Input/Output**: Ensure that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()` which is appropriate for reading all input at once in a competitive programming environment.

3. **Verify Logic**: The logic for calculating the LCM and determining the number of times all groups are on campus together seems correct, but we should ensure that the function is executed to see the results.

        # Calculate LCM of x, y, z
        lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        
        # Calculate total hours in N days
        total_hours = 24 * N
        
        # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure that the function is executed when the script runs.
- **Input/Output Handling**: The input and output handling remains the same, using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and `print()` to output results.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function will now be executed and produce the expected results.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with given complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    The core concept here was to efficiently update the scores of students over a range of indices and then compute the mean of these scores. The challenge was to handle potentially large input sizes, which required careful management of input reading and processing.

    Initially, the code failed to produce output because the `main()` function was not being called. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by adding a check to call `main()` when the script is executed. This is a common pattern in Python scripts to ensure that the main logic is executed.

    The solution involved:
    - Initializing an array to store scores for each student.
    - Iterating over each question and updating the scores for the specified range of students.
    - Calculating the total score and using floor division to find the mean.

    This problem reinforced the importance of handling input/output correctly and ensuring that the main logic is executed. It also highlighted the need to efficiently manage operations over potentially large datasets, which is a common requirement in competitive programming.

    ### Reflection

    The problem involved updating scores for a range of students based on the complexity of questions and then calculating the mean of these scores. The task was to efficiently handle potentially large input sizes.

    #### Key Insights from My Solution:
    - **Initialization and Updates**: I initialized all student scores to 10 and updated them based on the given questions. This approach was straightforward and aligned with the problem requirements.
    - **Handling Input and Output**: I used Python's `sys.stdin.read` for efficient input handling, which is crucial for large input sizes. This was a good choice given the constraints.
    - **Index Management**: I correctly managed the conversion from 1-based to 0-based indexing, which is a common requirement in competitive programming.

    #### Comparison with the Official Solution:
    - **Data Structure Choice**: The official solution used a dictionary to store scores, which is efficient in terms of space when only a subset of students' scores are updated. My solution used a list, which is simpler but may use more space if many students are not affected by any questions.
    - **Error Handling**: The official solution included a try-except block to handle potential input errors gracefully. This is a good practice in competitive programming to avoid runtime errors.
    - **Efficiency**: Both solutions effectively handle the problem within the constraints, but the dictionary approach in the official solution could be more space-efficient in scenarios where only a few students are affected by questions.

    Overall, my solution was correct and efficient, but the official solution provided an alternative approach using a dictionary, which could be beneficial in certain scenarios. This experience reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structures based on the problem constraints and requirements.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine how many times students from the first, second, and third years all arrive on campus at the same time over a period of `n` days. Each year group has a different frequency of visiting the campus: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on campus simultaneously within the given number of days.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the common times when all three groups of students are on campus. This happens at the least common multiple (LCM) of their visit intervals `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Calculate LCM**: The LCM of three numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three. This will give us the interval at which all three groups are on campus together.

3. **Determine the Number of Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this event occurs in `n` days. Since each day has 24 hours, the total number of hours in `n` days is `24 * n`. The number of times all groups are on campus together is the total hours divided by the LCM.

### Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`.
   - Calculate the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
   - Calculate the total number of hours in `n` days: `total_hours = 24 * n`.
   - Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together: `count = total_hours // LCM`.
   - Output `count`.

### Python Code

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])
        index += 3
        
        # Calculate LCM of x, y, z
        lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        
        # Calculate total hours in N days
        total_hours = 24 * N
        
        # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together
        count = total_hours // lcm_xyz

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine how many times students from the first, second, and third years all arrive on campus simultaneously over a given number of days. The key concept here was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the visit intervals for each year group, as this represents the interval at which all groups are on campus together.

### Core Concepts:
- **LCM Calculation**: The problem required calculating the LCM of three numbers, which was achieved by first finding the LCM of two numbers and then using that result to find the LCM with the third number.
- **Time Conversion**: The total number of hours in `n` days was calculated as `24 * n`, and this was used to determine how many times the LCM fits into this total time.

### Strategies and Fixes:
- **Function Execution**: Initially, the function `solve()` was not being called, leading to no output. Adding a call to `solve()` at the end of the script ensured that the logic was executed.
- **Input/Output Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read()` allowed for efficient reading of input in a competitive programming style, and `print()` was used to output results.

This problem reinforced the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed in script-based environments and highlighted the utility of LCM in solving problems involving periodic events.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The MarkiT online virtual market startup wants to organize its grand opening in NIT Patna.
but they want maximum crowd for their inauguration. So the manager told  this  to Praveen a student in NITP who suggested them:
The first-year students come to campus  every x hour,
Second-year students come to campus every y hour,
Third-year students come to campus every z hour and 
Fourth-year is very busy so they don't come regularly.
So Praveen being very clever told him the no of times in n days he can have an audience of all year student (1st,2nd & 3rd) at max. So can you code what Praveen has done?

INFO - [Task id] 694 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine how many times students from the first, second, and third years all arrive on campus at the same time over a period of `n` days. Each year group has a different frequency of visiting the campus: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on campus simultaneously within the given number of days.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the common times when all three groups of students are on campus. This happens at the least common multiple (LCM) of their visit intervals `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Calculate LCM**: The LCM of three numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three. This will give us the interval at which all three groups are on campus together.

3. **Determine the Number of Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this event occurs in `n` days. Since each day has 24 hours, the total number of hours in `n` days is `24 * n`. The number of times all groups are on campus together is the total hours divided by the LCM.

### Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`.
   - Calculate the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
   - Calculate the total number of hours in `n` days: `total_hours = 24 * n`.
   - Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together: `count = total_hours // LCM`.
   - Output `count`.

### Python Code

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])
        index += 3
        
        # Calculate LCM of x, y, z
        lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        
        # Calculate total hours in N days
        total_hours = 24 * N
        
        # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together
        count = total_hours // lcm_xyz
        
        results.append(count)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

### Explanation

- **GCD and LCM Functions**: We use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD), which helps in calculating the LCM.
- **LCM of Three Numbers**: We compute the LCM of three numbers by first finding the LCM of two numbers and then using that result to find the LCM with the third number.
- **Main Logic**: For each test case, we calculate the total number of hours in `n` days and divide it by the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z` to find how many times all groups are on campus together. This result is stored and printed for each test case.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called, which is a common issue when the function is defined but not executed. In competitive programming or script-based environments, the main function or logic should be executed directly to ensure the program runs as expected.

### Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Ensure Execution**: The `solve()` function should be called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed when the script runs.

2. **Check Input/Output**: Ensure that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()` which is appropriate for reading all input at once in a competitive programming environment.

3. **Verify Logic**: The logic for calculating the LCM and determining the number of times all groups are on campus together seems correct, but we should ensure that the function is executed to see the results.

### Revised Python Code

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])
        index += 3
        
        # Calculate LCM of x, y, z
        lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        
        # Calculate total hours in N days
        total_hours = 24 * N
        
        # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together
        count = total_hours // lcm_xyz
        
        results.append(count)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure that the function is executed when the script runs.
- **Input/Output Handling**: The input and output handling remains the same, using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and `print()` to output results.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function will now be executed and produce the expected results.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] In this exercise, the task was to determine how many times students from different years would be on campus simultaneously over a given number of days. The key insight was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the visit intervals for the first, second, and third-year students, and then determine how many times this LCM fits into the total hours available in the given days.

### Key Insights:

1. **LCM Calculation**: Both my solution and the official solution used the concept of LCM to find the common visit times. The official solution used a custom function to calculate the LCM by first finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, which is a standard approach.

2. **Handling Input and Output**: The official solution directly handled input and output in a loop, which is typical in competitive programming. My solution used `sys.stdin.read()` to handle input, which is also a valid approach but requires careful parsing.

3. **Execution**: The main issue in my initial attempt was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output. This was a simple oversight but crucial for ensuring the script runs as expected.

4. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient in terms of time complexity, as they primarily involve arithmetic operations and the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient for computing GCD.

### Reflection:

This exercise reinforced the importance of ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in environments where the function needs to be explicitly called. It also highlighted the utility of the Euclidean algorithm for GCD and how it can be used to compute the LCM, a common requirement in problems involving periodic events. The official solution was straightforward and aligned closely with my approach, confirming the effectiveness of the strategy used.
