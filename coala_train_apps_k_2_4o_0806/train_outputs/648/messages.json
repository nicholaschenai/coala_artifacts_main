In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.\nJudges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.\nPlease help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:\nType 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).\nType 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).\n\n-----Input-----\n- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.\n- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.\n- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 100,000\n- 1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 1,000,000\n- 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N\n- -1,000,000 \u2264 X \u2264 1,000,000\n- 1 \u2264 i, k \u2264 N\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 1,000 \n- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n5 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 1 2\n2 3 4 -1\n1 1 2\n\nOutput:\n3\n4\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.\nThe second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).\nThe last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

We need to handle two types of operations on these hills:\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**:\n   - Start at the given hill index `i`.\n   - For each jump, look for the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.\n   - If such a hill is found within 100 hills, move to that hill and continue jumping.\n   - If no such hill is found, or if the maximum number of jumps `k` is reached, stop and return the current hill index.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**:\n   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for each operation in operations:\n        if operation is of Type 1:\n            i, k = operation parameters\n            current_index = i - 1\n            for jump in range(k):\n                found_higher_hill = False\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        current_index = j\n                        found_higher_hill = True\n                        break\n                if not found_higher_hill:\n                    break\n            output current_index + 1\n        else if operation is of Type 2:\n            L, R, X = operation parameters\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    results = []\n    for operation in operations:\n        if operation[0] == 1:\n            # Type 1 operation\n            i, k = operation[1], operation[2]\n            current_index = i - 1\n            for _ in range(k):\n                found_higher_hill = False\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        current_index = j\n                        found_higher_hill = True\n                        break\n                if not found_higher_hill:\n                    break\n            results.append(current_index + 1)\n        elif operation[0] == 2:\n            # Type 2 operation\n            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nN = int(data[0])\nQ = int(data[1])\nheights = list(map(int, data[2:N+2]))\noperations = []\nindex = N + 2\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    op_type = int(data[index])\n    if op_type == 1:\n        i = int(data[index + 1])\n        k = int(data[index + 2])\n        operations.append((1, i, k))\n        index += 3\n    elif op_type == 2:\n        L = int(data[index + 1])\n        R = int(data[index + 2])\n        X = int(data[index + 3])\n        operations.append((2, L, R, X))\n        index += 4\n\n# Process operations and print results\nresults = process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the results for Type 1 operations.

The solution should consider both left and right directions for each reservoir placement.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Traversal Logic**:\n           - The logic for moving to the next hill was flawed.

Perform two passes over the list of hills:\n             - **Left to Right Pass**: Determine the farthest hill that can be covered by a reservoir placed on each hill when flowing to the right.\n             -

We need to perform two types of operations on these hills:\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the index of the hill where a participant will end up after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**:\n   - Start from the given hill index `i`.\n   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.\n   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.\n   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**:\n   - Simply iterate over the range from `L` to `R` and adjust each hill's height by `X`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for each operation in operations:\n        if operation is of type 1:\n            i, k = operation parameters\n            current_index = i - 1\n            while k > 0:\n                next_index = -1\n                for j from current_index + 1 to min(current_index + 100, N - 1):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        next_index = j\n                        break\n                if next_index == -1:\n                    break\n                current_index = next_index\n                k -= 1\n            print(current_index + 1)\n        else if operation is of type 2:\n            L, R, X = operation parameters\n            for j from L - 1 to R - 1:\n                heights[j] += X\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for operation in operations:\n        if operation[0] == 1:\n            # Type 1 operation\n            i, k = operation[1], operation[2]\n            current_index = i - 1\n            while k > 0:\n                next_index = -1\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        next_index = j\n                        break\n                if next_index == -1:\n                    break\n                current_index = next_index\n                k -= 1\n            print(current_index + 1)\n        elif operation[0] == 2:\n            # Type 2 operation\n            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    Q = int(data[1])\n    heights = list(map(int, data[2:N+2]))\n    operations = []\n    \n    index = N + 2\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        op_type = int(data[index])\n        if op_type == 1:\n            i = int(data[index + 1])\n            k = int(data[index + 2])\n            operations.append((op_type, i, k))\n            index += 3\n        elif op_type == 2:\n            L = int(data[index + 1])\n            R = int(data[index + 2])\n            X = int(data[index + 3])\n            operations.append((op_type, L, R, X))\n            index += 4\n    \n    process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Type 1 Operation**: We iterate from the current hill to find the next higher hill within 100 hills.

The core concept was efficiently managing these operations given constraints on the number of hills and operations.\n\nFor the **Type 1 operation**, the challenge was to simulate jumps between hills based on their heights. The key was to find the nearest higher hill within a 100-hill range. This required a loop to check each subsequent hill until a suitable one was found or the range limit was reached. The solution involved iterating over the hills and using a nested loop to find the next higher hill, which was straightforward but required careful index management.\n\nFor the **Type 2 operation**, the task was simpler: adjust the heights of hills within a specified range. This was efficiently handled by iterating over the specified range and updating each hill's height.\n\nThe main learning point was handling large input sizes efficiently, especially with the nested loop in the Type 1 operation. The solution was successful in passing all tests, indicating that the approach was both correct and efficient within the given constraints.

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the hill jumping competition, the approach I took was quite similar to the official solution, and both passed the test cases successfully. However, there are a few insights and differences worth noting:\n\n1. **Loop Structure and Efficiency**:\n   - Both solutions use a nested loop structure to handle the Type 1 operation, where we search for the next higher hill within a range of 100 hills. The official solution uses a `while` loop with a condition that checks both the range and whether a valid jump has been found (`temp == 0`). This is a concise way to break out of the loop once a jump is made, which is slightly more efficient than my approach that uses a `for` loop with a `break` statement.\n\n2. **Handling Type 2 Operations**:\n   - Both solutions handle the Type 2 operation by iterating over the specified range and adjusting the heights. The official solution directly modifies the list in place, which is straightforward and efficient.\n\n3. **Output Collection**:\n   - The official solution collects all results for Type 1 operations in a list (`final`) and prints them at the end. This is a good practice for batch processing outputs, especially when dealing with large input sizes, as it minimizes the number of I/O operations.\n\n4. **Code Readability**:\n   - The official solution uses concise variable names and a direct approach, which makes it easy to follow. However, using more descriptive variable names could improve readability for someone unfamiliar with the problem.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, with a focus on minimizing operations within the constraints. The key takeaway is the importance of efficient loop structures and batch processing outputs for performance optimization in competitive programming."

It parses this input data to extract the number of elements (N), the number of operations (Q), the list of heights, and the operations themselves. The operations are stored in a list, where each operation is either of type 1 or type 2, with associated parameters. After parsing, it calls another function to process these operations on the list of heights.

The problem involves efficiently handling two types of operations on an array: jumping to the next higher element within a constraint and updating a range of elements. This is a common pattern in competitive programming and real-world applications like game development, where you might need to simulate movements or changes in a landscape. Understanding how to implement these operations efficiently can help in optimizing performance in systems that require frequent updates and queries."
