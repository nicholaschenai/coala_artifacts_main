We need to perform two types of operations on these hills:\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the index of the hill where a participant will end up after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**:\n   - Start from the given hill index `i`.\n   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.\n   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.\n   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**:\n   - Simply iterate over the range from `L` to `R` and adjust each hill's height by `X`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for each operation in operations:\n        if operation is of type 1:\n            i, k = operation parameters\n            current_index = i - 1\n            while k > 0:\n                next_index = -1\n                for j from current_index + 1 to min(current_index + 100, N - 1):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        next_index = j\n                        break\n                if next_index == -1:\n                    break\n                current_index = next_index\n                k -= 1\n            print(current_index + 1)\n        else if operation is of type 2:\n            L, R, X = operation parameters\n            for j from L - 1 to R - 1:\n                heights[j] += X\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for operation in operations:\n        if operation[0] == 1:\n            # Type 1 operation\n            i, k = operation[1], operation[2]\n            current_index = i - 1\n            while k > 0:\n                next_index = -1\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        next_index = j\n                        break\n                if next_index == -1:\n                    break\n                current_index = next_index\n                k -= 1\n            print(current_index + 1)\n        elif operation[0] == 2:\n            # Type 2 operation\n            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    Q = int(data[1])\n    heights = list(map(int, data[2:N+2]))\n    operations = []\n    \n    index = N + 2\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        op_type = int(data[index])\n        if op_type == 1:\n            i = int(data[index + 1])\n            k = int(data[index + 2])\n            operations.append((op_type, i, k))\n            index += 3\n        elif op_type == 2:\n            L = int(data[index + 1])\n            R = int(data[index + 2])\n            X = int(data[index + 3])\n            operations.append((op_type, L, R, X))\n            index += 4\n    \n    process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Type 1 Operation**: We iterate from the current hill to find the next higher hill within 100 hills. We repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.\n- **Type 2 Operation**: We simply adjust the heights of the hills in the specified range by `X`.",
