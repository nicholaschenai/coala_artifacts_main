## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills, each with a specific height. We need to handle two types of operations on these hills:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start at the given hill index `i`.
   - For each jump, look for the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.
   - If such a hill is found within 100 hills, move to that hill and continue jumping.
   - If no such hill is found, or if the maximum number of jumps `k` is reached, stop and return the current hill index.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of Type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i - 1
            for jump in range(k):
                found_higher_hill = False
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        current_index = j
                        found_higher_hill = True
                        break
                if not found_higher_hill:
                    break
            output current_index + 1
        else if operation is of Type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    results = []
    for operation in operations:
        if operation[0] == 1:
            # Type 1 operation
            i, k = operation[1], operation[2]
            current_index = i - 1
            for _ in range(k):
                found_higher_hill = False
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        current_index = j
                        found_higher_hill = True
                        break
                if not found_higher_hill:
                    break
            results.append(current_index + 1)
        elif operation[0] == 2:
            # Type 2 operation
            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
N = int(data[0])
Q = int(data[1])
heights = list(map(int, data[2:N+2]))
operations = []
index = N + 2
for _ in range(Q):
    op_type = int(data[index])
    if op_type == 1:
        i = int(data[index + 1])
        k = int(data[index + 2])
        operations.append((1, i, k))
        index += 3
    elif op_type == 2:
        L = int(data[index + 1])
        R = int(data[index + 2])
        X = int(data[index + 3])
        operations.append((2, L, R, X))
        index += 4

# Process operations and print results
results = process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the results for Type 1 operations. The logic ensures that the constraints and requirements of the problem are met efficiently.

Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one.

    [Task]:
        In ChefLand, there is a mountain range consisting of $N$ hills (numbered $1$ through $N$) in a straight line. Let's denote the height of the $i$-th hill from the left by $h_i$.
        Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it â€” either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height $h$, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than $h$; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.
        For example, suppose we have hills with heights $[7, 2, 3, 5, 8]$. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height $5$, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights $2$, $3$ and $5$ are supplied with water.
        Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of reservoirs.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $2 \le N \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
        - $h_i \neq h_j $ for any valid $i \neq j$

        ## Problem Restatement

        We have a sequence of hills with varying heights. We need to place water reservoirs on some of these hills such that water can flow optimally to cover all hills. Water from a reservoir can flow in one direction until it encounters a hill that is taller than the hill with the reservoir. The task is to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to ensure all hills receive water.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Water Flow**: 
           - Water flows from a reservoir on a hill to the next hill in the chosen direction until it encounters a hill that is taller than the current hill.
           - The goal is to cover all hills with the minimum number of reservoirs.

        2. **Strategy**:
           - Traverse the list of hills from left to right to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to cover all hills.
           - Use a greedy approach to place reservoirs at strategic points where the water can cover the maximum number of hills.

        3. **Steps**:
           - Start from the first hill and move to the right.
           - Keep track of the highest hill encountered so far.
           - If a hill is taller than the current highest hill, place a reservoir on the previous hill (if not already covered) and update the highest hill.
           - Continue this process until all hills are covered.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function min_reservoirs(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, heights = test_case
                reservoirs = 0
                max_height = 0
                for i from 0 to N-1:
                    if heights[i] > max_height:
                        reservoirs += 1
                        max_height = heights[i]
                results.append(reservoirs)
            return results
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def min_reservoirs(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                N, heights = test_case
                reservoirs = 0
                max_height = 0
                for i in range(N):
                    if heights[i] > max_height:
                        reservoirs += 1
                        max_height = heights[i]
                results.append(reservoirs)
            return results

        def main():

                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **min_reservoirs Function**: This function takes the number of test cases and a list of test cases. Each test case contains the number of hills and their respective heights. It calculates the minimum number of reservoirs needed for each test case and returns the results.
        - **main Function**: This function handles input and output. It reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

    [Task]:
        In ChefLand, there is a mountain range consisting of $N$ hills (numbered $1$ through $N$) in a straight line. Let's denote the height of the $i$-th hill from the left by $h_i$.
        Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it â€” either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height $h$, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than $h$; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.
        For example, suppose we have hills with heights $[7, 2, 3, 5, 8]$. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height $5$, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights $2$, $3$ and $5$ are supplied with water.
        Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of reservoirs.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $2 \le N \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
        - $h_i \neq h_j $ for any valid $i \neq j$
        - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

        -----Example Input-----
        1
        6
        4 16 32 6 8 2

        -----Example Output-----
        2    

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1: We can place reservoirs on the second and third hill, pumping water to the left and right respectively.

        ## Analysis of the Problem

        The problem requires us to place the minimum number of reservoirs on hills such that water can flow to cover all hills. The water can flow in one direction until it encounters a hill that is taller than the current hill with the reservoir.

        ## Where the Code Went Wrong

        1. **Misinterpretation of Peaks**:
           - The previous solution attempted to place reservoirs at peaks, but it didn't correctly account for the optimal direction of water flow. The solution should consider both left and right directions for each reservoir placement.

        2. **Incorrect Traversal Logic**:
           - The logic for moving to the next hill was flawed. It didn't correctly identify when to place a new reservoir based on the heights of the hills.

        3. **Optimal Strategy**:
           - The solution should consider placing reservoirs in such a way that the maximum number of hills are covered in both directions (left and right) from each reservoir.

        ## Correct Approach

        1. **Two-Pass Strategy**:
           - Perform two passes over the list of hills:
             - **Left to Right Pass**: Determine the farthest hill that can be covered by a reservoir placed on each hill when flowing to the right.
             - **Right to Left Pass**: Determine the farthest hill that can be covered by a reservoir placed on each hill when flowing to the left.

        2. **Determine Minimum Reservoirs**:
           - Use the results from both passes to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to cover all hills.

        ## Revised Pseudocode

        ```
        function min_reservoirs(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, heights = test_case
                left_cover = [0] * N
                right_cover = [0] * N
        
                # Left to Right Pass
                max_height = 0
                for i from 0 to N-1:
                    if heights[i] > max_height:
                        max_height = heights[i]
                    left_cover[i] = max_height
        
                # Right to Left Pass
                max_height = 0
                for i from N-1 to 0:
                    if heights[i] > max_height:
                        max_height = heights[i]
                    right_cover[i] = max_height
        
                # Determine minimum reservoirs
                reservoirs = 0
                i = 0
                while i < N:
                    reservoirs += 1
                    # Find the farthest hill that can be covered
                    farthest = i
                    while farthest < N and (left_cover[farthest] <= heights[i] or right_cover[farthest] <= heights[i]):
                        farthest += 1
                    i = farthest
        
                results.append(reservoirs)
            return results

        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code

        - **Two-Pass Strategy**: The code now uses two passes to determine the farthest hills that can be covered from each hill when flowing in both directions.
        - **Reservoir Placement**: The code calculates the minimum number of reservoirs needed by checking the farthest hill that can be covered from each starting point.
        - **Efficient Coverage**: By using the `left_reach` and `right_reach` arrays, the code efficiently determines the optimal placement of reservoirs to cover all hills with the minimum number of reservoirs.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's address the problem with a more accurate approach. The goal is to place the minimum number of reservoirs on the hills such that all hills are covered by water flowing either to the left or right. Here's the corrected solution:

            for test_case in test_cases:
                N, heights = test_case
        
                # We need to find the number of peaks in the sequence
                # A peak is a hill that is higher than the previous hill and the next hill
                reservoirs = 0
                i = 0
        
                while i < N:
                    # We place a reservoir at the current hill
                    reservoirs += 1
            
                    # Move to the next hill that is higher than the current one
                    j = i + 1

        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code

        - **Reservoir Placement**: The code places a reservoir at each peak, which is a hill that is higher than both its previous and next hills. This ensures that water can flow optimally to cover all hills.
        - **Traversal Logic**: The code uses a while loop to traverse the list of hills, placing reservoirs at strategic points and skipping over hills that are already covered by the current reservoir.
        - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently determines the minimum number of reservoirs needed by focusing on peaks, ensuring that all hills are covered with minimal reservoir placement.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills with given heights. We need to perform two types of operations on these hills:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the index of the hill where a participant will end up after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start from the given hill index `i`.
   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.
   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.
   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the range from `L` to `R` and adjust each hill's height by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i - 1
            while k > 0:

                for j from current_index + 1 to min(current_index + 100, N - 1):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        next_index = j
                        break

                current_index = next_index
                k -= 1
            print(current_index + 1)
        else if operation is of type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for j from L - 1 to R - 1:

### Explanation

- **Type 1 Operation**: We iterate from the current hill to find the next higher hill within 100 hills. We repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.
- **Type 2 Operation**: We simply adjust the heights of the hills in the specified range by `X`.

### Explanation

- **Type 1 Operation**: We iterate from the current hill to find the next higher hill within 100 hills. We repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.
- **Type 2 Operation**: We simply adjust the heights of the hills in the specified range by `X`.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills with given heights. We need to perform two types of operations on these hills:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the index of the hill where a participant will end up after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start from the given hill index `i`.
   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.
   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.
   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the range from `L` to `R` and adjust each hill's height by `X`.

    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] In this problem, I dealt with a sequence of hills and two types of operations: jumping between hills and adjusting hill heights. The core concept was efficiently managing these operations given constraints on the number of hills and operations.

For the **Type 1 operation**, the challenge was to simulate jumps between hills based on their heights. The key was to find the nearest higher hill within a 100-hill range. This required a loop to check each subsequent hill until a suitable one was found or the range limit was reached. The solution involved iterating over the hills and using a nested loop to find the next higher hill, which was straightforward but required careful index management.

For the **Type 2 operation**, the task was simpler: adjust the heights of hills within a specified range. This was efficiently handled by iterating over the specified range and updating each hill's height.

The main learning point was handling large input sizes efficiently, especially with the nested loop in the Type 1 operation. The solution was successful in passing all tests, indicating that the approach was both correct and efficient within the given constraints. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and efficiently managing loops and conditions.

### Explanation

- **Type 1 Operation**: We iterate from the current hill to find the next higher hill within 100 hills. We repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.
- **Type 2 Operation**: We simply adjust the heights of the hills in the specified range by `X`.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the hill jumping competition, the approach I took was quite similar to the official solution, and both passed the test cases successfully. However, there are a few insights and differences worth noting:

1. **Loop Structure and Efficiency**:
   - Both solutions use a nested loop structure to handle the Type 1 operation, where we search for the next higher hill within a range of 100 hills. The official solution uses a `while` loop with a condition that checks both the range and whether a valid jump has been found (`temp == 0`). This is a concise way to break out of the loop once a jump is made, which is slightly more efficient than my approach that uses a `for` loop with a `break` statement.

2. **Handling Type 2 Operations**:
   - Both solutions handle the Type 2 operation by iterating over the specified range and adjusting the heights. The official solution directly modifies the list in place, which is straightforward and efficient.

3. **Output Collection**:
   - The official solution collects all results for Type 1 operations in a list (`final`) and prints them at the end. This is a good practice for batch processing outputs, especially when dealing with large input sizes, as it minimizes the number of I/O operations.

4. **Code Readability**:
   - The official solution uses concise variable names and a direct approach, which makes it easy to follow. However, using more descriptive variable names could improve readability for someone unfamiliar with the problem.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, with a focus on minimizing operations within the constraints. The key takeaway is the importance of efficient loop structures and batch processing outputs for performance optimization in competitive programming.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, I dealt with a sequence of hills and two types of operations: jumping between hills and adjusting hill heights. The core concept was efficiently managing these operations given constraints on the number of hills and operations.

For the **Type 1 operation**, the challenge was to ...,

[Problem]
    Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
    Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
    Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
    Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
    Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

    -----Input-----
    - First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
    - Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
    - Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

    -----Output-----
    For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
    - 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
    - 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
    - -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
    - 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

    -----Subtasks-----
    - Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
    - Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    5 3
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 1 2
    2 3 4 -1
    1 1 2

    Output:
    3
    4

    -----Explanation-----
    The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
    The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
    The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.
