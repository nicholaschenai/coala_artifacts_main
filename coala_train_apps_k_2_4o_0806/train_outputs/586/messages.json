The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.\n$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. \nThat means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').\nIt is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.\n\n-----Input:-----Input:\n- \nFirst line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

The key steps involved sorting subtasks by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers. This required careful handling of input parsing and sorting logic.\n\n    The strategy that worked was to pair scores with contestant numbers, sort these pairs by score, and then iterate through the sorted list to count decreases. The difficulty was then represented as a tuple of the decrease count and the problem index, which was sorted to determine the order of problem difficulty.\n\n    A potential pitfall was ensuring the correct sorting order for the final output, which required sorting by the decrease count in ascending order and by problem index in descending order when counts were equal. This was handled using a custom sort key.\n\n    Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding sorting and tuple manipulation in Python, as well as careful input handling for competitive programming scenarios. The solution was efficient due to the constraints, with a focus on sorting and counting operations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Mandarin chinese\n        , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n        Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).\n        The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:\n        - Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.\n        - Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.\n        - Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.\n        - For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.\n        You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.\n        - $2P$ lines follow.

Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is determined by counting how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We need to sort the problems by difficulty, where a problem is considered more difficult if it has more decreases, or if the number of decreases is the same, the problem with the higher index is considered more difficult. Finally, we output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of problems `P` and the number of subtasks `S`. For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.\n\n        2. **Calculate Difficulty**: For each problem, sort the subtasks by score. Count the number of times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.\n\n        3. **Sort Problems**: Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty count and the problem index. Sort this list first by the difficulty count in ascending order, and then by the problem index in descending order if the difficulty counts are the same.\n\n        4. **Output**: Extract and print the problem indices from the sorted list.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):\n            difficulties = []\n            for i from 0 to P-1:\n                scores = problems[i][0]\n                contestants = problems[i][1]\n        \n                // Pair scores with contestants and sort by score\n                paired = zip(scores, contestants)\n                sorted_paired = sort(paired by score)\n        \n                // Count decreases in contestants\n                decrease_count = 0\n                for j from 0 to S-2:\n                    if sorted_paired[j][1] > sorted_paired[j+1][1]:\n                        decrease_count += 1\n        \n                // Store difficulty as a tuple (decrease_count, i+1)\n                difficulties.append((decrease_count, i+1))\n    \n            // Sort difficulties by (decrease_count, -index)\n            sorted_difficulties = sort(difficulties by (decrease_count, -index))\n    \n            // Extract and print indices\n            for difficulty in sorted_difficulties:\n                print(difficulty[1])\n\n        // Read input and call calculate_difficulty\n        ```\n\n        ## Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):\n            difficulties = []\n            for i in range(P):\n                scores = problems[i][0]\n                contestants = problems[i][1]\n        \n                # Pair scores with contestants and sort by score\n                paired = list(zip(scores, contestants))\n                paired.sort()  # Sort by score since scores are the first element in the tuple\n        \n                # Count decreases in contestants\n                decrease_count = 0\n                for j in range(S - 1):\n                    if paired[j][1] > paired[j + 1][1]:\n                        decrease_count += 1\n        \n                # Store difficulty as a tuple (decrease_count, i+1)\n                difficulties.append((decrease_count, i + 1))\n    \n            # Sort difficulties by (decrease_count, -index)\n            difficulties.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n    \n            # Extract and print indices\n            for difficulty in difficulties:\n                print(difficulty[1])\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        P = int(data[0])\n        S = int(data[1])\n        problems = []\n\n        index = 2\n        for _ in range(P):\n            scores = list(map(int, data[index:index + S]))\n            contestants = list(map(int, data[index + S:index + 2 * S]))\n            problems.append((scores, contestants))\n            index += 2 * S\n\n        calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems)\n        ```\n\n        This code reads the input, calculates the difficulty for each problem, sorts them according to the specified criteria, and outputs the indices in the required order.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['3 3', '16 24 60', '498 861 589', '14 24 62', '72 557 819', '16 15 69', '435 779 232'] Output: 2\n        1\n        3\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

        "content": "In this problem, the task was to correctly identify teams based on scrambled names and calculate their total scores, then sort and output them based on specific criteria. The problem was straightforward in terms of logic but required careful handling of string manipulations and sorting.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Character Sorting for Identification**: Both my solution and the official solution used the technique of sorting characters in team names to uniquely identify teams. This is a crucial step because it allows us to map scrambled names back to their original form.\n\n2. **Score Accumulation**: The official solution uses a clever trick by initializing scores with a large number (`10**10`) and then subtracting scores to accumulate them. This approach simplifies the sorting process by allowing direct sorting of the list based on scores.\n\n3. **Sorting and Output**: Both solutions sort the teams by their scores in descending order and by name lexicographically when scores are tied. The official solution achieves this by storing negative scores, which allows for a natural ascending sort to work as a descending sort.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution is efficient and concise, particularly in its use of a large initial value to handle score accumulation and sorting. This approach reduces the need for additional data structures to track scores separately. My solution was more explicit in maintaining separate mappings for team names and scores, which is clear but slightly more verbose.\n\nIn future problems involving similar tasks of identifying entities from scrambled data and sorting based on multiple criteria, the technique of using sorted character strings for unique identification and the trick of using large initial values for score manipulation could be very useful. These methods streamline the process and reduce potential errors in handling complex data transformations."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes multiple test cases, each specifying the number of submissions and the number of initial correct submissions. For each test case, it processes the submissions to map scrambled team names to their correct names using the first set of submissions. It then updates the scores for each team based on subsequent submissions, using the mapping to ensure scores are attributed to the correct team. After processing all submissions, it sorts the teams by their scores in descending order, and by name lexicographically in case of ties, and prints the sorted list of teams with their scores.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to handle and process data that involves permutations of strings, such as when the order of characters in a string does not matter. This is common in problems involving anagrams, where different permutations of the same set of characters need to be identified as equivalent. The solution also demonstrates how to efficiently map scrambled data to its original form using sorting, which is a common technique in data processing tasks. Additionally, the problem involves sorting data based on multiple criteria, which is a frequent requirement in competitive programming and data analysis tasks. Understanding how to sort by multiple keys, such as by score and then lexicographically, is a valuable skill in many programming and data manipulation contexts."
