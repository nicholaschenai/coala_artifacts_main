## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a programming competition where each team submits their team name and score. Due to an error, the order of characters in team names got scrambled, but each team name is unique based on character frequency. We need to calculate the total score for each team and print the results in descending order of scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour.
2. **Team Identification**: Use a dictionary to map sorted team names (as keys) to their actual team names and scores.
3. **Score Aggregation**: For each submission, sort the team name to find the correct team and add the score to their total.
4. **Sorting and Output**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by score in descending order, then by team name lexicographically if scores are tied. Print the results.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case():
    read N, R
    initialize team_scores as an empty dictionary
    initialize team_names as an empty dictionary

    for i from 1 to R:
        read team_name, score
        sorted_name = sort_characters(team_name)
        team_scores[sorted_name] = score
        team_names[sorted_name] = team_name

    for i from 1 to N-R:
        read scrambled_name, score
        sorted_name = sort_characters(scrambled_name)
        team_scores[sorted_name] += score

    create a list of (team_name, score) from team_scores and team_names
    sort the list by score descending, then by team_name lexicographically

    for each team in sorted list:
        print team_name, score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        process_test_case()
```

### Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    N, R = map(int, data[0].split())
    team_scores = {}
    team_names = {}
    
    # Process the first R submissions
    for i in range(1, R + 1):
        line = data[i].strip()
        team_name, score = line.rsplit(' ', 1)
        score = int(score)
        sorted_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))
        team_scores[sorted_name] = score
        team_names[sorted_name] = team_name
    
    # Process the remaining N-R submissions
    for i in range(R + 1, N + 1):
        line = data[i].strip()
        scrambled_name, score = line.rsplit(' ', 1)
        score = int(score)
        sorted_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_name))
        if sorted_name in team_scores:
            team_scores[sorted_name] += score
    
    # Prepare the result list
    result = [(team_names[sorted_name], score) for sorted_name, score in team_scores.items()]
    
    # Sort by score descending, then by team name lexicographically
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
    
    # Print the result
    for team_name, score in result:
        print(f"{team_name} {score}")

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())
        process_test_case()
        index += N + 1

main()
```

This solution reads input directly from standard input, processes each test case by aggregating scores based on sorted team names, and outputs the results in the required order.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the difficulty of problems based on the number of decreases in the number of contestants solving subtasks as the subtask scores increase. The key steps involved sorting subtasks by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers. This required careful handling of input parsing and sorting logic.

    The strategy that worked was to pair scores with contestant numbers, sort these pairs by score, and then iterate through the sorted list to count decreases. The difficulty was then represented as a tuple of the decrease count and the problem index, which was sorted to determine the order of problem difficulty.

    A potential pitfall was ensuring the correct sorting order for the final output, which required sorting by the decrease count in ascending order and by problem index in descending order when counts were equal. This was handled using a custom sort key.

    Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding sorting and tuple manipulation in Python, as well as careful input handling for competitive programming scenarios. The solution was efficient due to the constraints, with a focus on sorting and counting operations.

        , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
        Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
        The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
        - Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
        - Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
        - Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
        - For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
        You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
        - $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

        -----Output-----
        Print $P$ lines containing one integer each — the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \le P \le 100,000$
        - $2 \le S \le 30$
        - $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
        - $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
        - in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

        -----Subtasks-----
        Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$

        ## Problem Restatement

        We have a contest with multiple problems, each containing several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is determined by counting how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We need to sort the problems by difficulty, where a problem is considered more difficult if it has more decreases, or if the number of decreases is the same, the problem with the higher index is considered more difficult. Finally, we output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of problems `P` and the number of subtasks `S`. For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.

        2. **Calculate Difficulty**: For each problem, sort the subtasks by score. Count the number of times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.

        3. **Sort Problems**: Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty count and the problem index. Sort this list first by the difficulty count in ascending order, and then by the problem index in descending order if the difficulty counts are the same.

        4. **Output**: Extract and print the problem indices from the sorted list.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
            difficulties = []
            for i from 0 to P-1:
                scores = problems[i][0]
                contestants = problems[i][1]
        
                // Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
                paired = zip(scores, contestants)
                sorted_paired = sort(paired by score)
        
                // Count decreases in contestants
                decrease_count = 0
                for j from 0 to S-2:
                    if sorted_paired[j][1] > sorted_paired[j+1][1]:
                        decrease_count += 1
        
                // Store difficulty as a tuple (decrease_count, i+1)
                difficulties.append((decrease_count, i+1))
    
            // Sort difficulties by (decrease_count, -index)
            sorted_difficulties = sort(difficulties by (decrease_count, -index))
    
            // Extract and print indices
            for difficulty in sorted_difficulties:
                print(difficulty[1])

        // Read input and call calculate_difficulty
        ```

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a programming competition where each team has a unique name, but due to an error, the order of characters in the team names was scrambled. Each team submitted their name and score once within the first half-hour, and then continued to submit scores for the rest of the competition. We need to calculate the total score for each team, identify the correct team names, and then output the teams sorted by their total scores in descending order. If two teams have the same score, they should be sorted lexicographically by their names.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include scrambled team names and scores.

2. **Identify Teams**: Use the first half-hour submissions to identify the correct team names by sorting the characters in each name. This will allow us to map scrambled names to the correct team names.

3. **Calculate Scores**: For each submission, sort the characters in the team name to find the correct team. Accumulate the scores for each team.

4. **Sort and Output**: Sort the teams by their total scores in descending order. If scores are tied, sort by team name lexicographically. Output the sorted list of team names and their scores.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to handle scrambled team names and calculate scores accurately. The challenge was to map scrambled names back to their original form using character sorting, which allowed us to uniquely identify each team despite the scrambling. This was crucial because the problem guaranteed that no two teams would have the same character frequency, making sorting a reliable method for identification.

The strategy that worked well was to first process the initial submissions to establish a mapping between sorted character strings and the original team names. This mapping was then used to correctly accumulate scores for each team as further submissions were processed. Sorting the final results by score in descending order and by name lexicographically when scores were tied ensured the correct output format.

One potential pitfall was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly, especially since the team names and scores were provided in a single line. Using `rsplit` helped in correctly separating the team name from the score, even when the team name contained spaces. This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and the utility of character sorting for solving problems involving scrambled strings.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a programming competition where each team has a unique name, but due to an error, the order of characters in the team names was scrambled. Each team submitted their name and score once within the first half-hour, and then continued to submit scores for the rest of the competition. We need to calculate the total score for each team, identify the correct team names, and then output the teams sorted by their total scores in descending order. If two teams have the same score, they should be sorted lexicographically by their names.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include scrambled team names and scores.

2. **Identify Teams**: Use the first half-hour submissions to identify the correct team names by sorting the characters in each name. This will allow us to map scrambled names to the correct team names.

3. **Calculate Scores**: For each submission, sort the characters in the team name to find the correct team. Accumulate the scores for each team.

4. **Sort and Output**: Sort the teams by their total scores in descending order. If scores are tied, sort by team name lexicographically. Output the sorted list of team names and their scores.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, R, submissions):
    team_scores = {}
    team_names = {}

    // Process first R submissions to map scrambled names to correct names
    for i from 0 to R-1:
        scrambled_name, score = submissions[i]
        sorted_name = sort_characters(scrambled_name)
        team_names[sorted_name] = scrambled_name
        team_scores[scrambled_name] = score

    // Process remaining submissions

        correct_name = team_names[sorted_name]
        team_scores[correct_name] += score

    // Sort teams by score and name

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to correctly identify teams based on scrambled names and calculate their total scores, then sort and output them based on specific criteria. The problem was straightforward in terms of logic but required careful handling of string manipulations and sorting.

### Key Insights:

1. **Character Sorting for Identification**: Both my solution and the official solution used the technique of sorting characters in team names to uniquely identify teams. This is a crucial step because it allows us to map scrambled names back to their original form.

2. **Score Accumulation**: The official solution uses a clever trick by initializing scores with a large number (`10**10`) and then subtracting scores to accumulate them. This approach simplifies the sorting process by allowing direct sorting of the list based on scores.

3. **Sorting and Output**: Both solutions sort the teams by their scores in descending order and by name lexicographically when scores are tied. The official solution achieves this by storing negative scores, which allows for a natural ascending sort to work as a descending sort.

### Reflection:

The official solution is efficient and concise, particularly in its use of a large initial value to handle score accumulation and sorting. This approach reduces the need for additional data structures to track scores separately. My solution was more explicit in maintaining separate mappings for team names and scores, which is clear but slightly more verbose.

In future problems involving similar tasks of identifying entities from scrambled data and sorting based on multiple criteria, the technique of using sorted character strings for unique identification and the trick of using large initial values for score manipulation could be very useful. These methods streamline the process and reduce potential errors in handling complex data transformations.
