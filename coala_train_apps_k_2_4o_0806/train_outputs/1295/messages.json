For each query, we need to calculate the sum S(N, K) which is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers modulo K. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n- F(0) = 0\n- F(1) = 1\n- F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2) for i >= 2\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so calculating it directly for large N is inefficient. However, we only need the sum modulo K, which can be simplified using properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n2. **Use Pisano Period**: The Fibonacci sequence modulo any number K is periodic, known as the Pisano period. This means that after a certain number of terms, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo K repeats. We can use this property to reduce the computation for large N.\n\n3. **Calculate Pisano Period**: For each query, calculate the Pisano period for the given K. This will help us determine how the Fibonacci sequence behaves under modulo K.\n\n4. **Sum within Pisano Period**: Once the Pisano period is known, calculate the sum of Fibonacci numbers within one full period. Use this to compute the sum for N terms by considering how many full periods fit into N and the remainder.\n\n5. **Compute Result for Each Query**: For each query, use the Pisano period and the precomputed sums to quickly calculate the result S(N, K).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction pisano_period(k):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i from 0 to k*k:\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % k\n        if a == 0 and b == 1:\n            return i + 1\n\nfunction fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):\n    period = pisano_period(k)\n    full_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    fib_mod = [0, 1]\n    for i from 2 to period:\n        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)\n    \n    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k\n    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k\n    \n    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k\n\nfunction main():\n    read Q\n    for each query:\n        read N, K\n        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)\n        print result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef pisano_period(k):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in range(k * k):\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % k\n        if a == 0 and b == 1:\n            return i + 1\n\ndef fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):\n    period = pisano_period(k)\n    full_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    fib_mod = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, period):\n        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)\n    \n    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k\n    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k\n    \n    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    Q = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers modulo K for each query by leveraging the periodic nature of the Fibonacci sequence under modulo operations."

This periodicity occurs every 60 numbers, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the problem. Instead of calculating potentially massive Fibonacci numbers, we only need to consider the first 60 numbers and their last digits.\n\n    The solution involves precomputing the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. For each test case, we determine the effective length of the sequence by taking `N % 60`. If the result is zero, it means the sequence should be the full 60 numbers. We then simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains.\n\n    This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially given the large possible values of N (up to \\(10^{18}\\)). The use of slicing to reduce the sequence was a straightforward and effective method to simulate the required process. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns and periodicity in sequences to optimize solutions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.\n        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.\n        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.\n\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\n        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.\n        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each test case print required answer.\n\n        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=1000000\n        Subtask 3: 5 points\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=16\n        - 1<=Q<=1000\n        Subtask 1: 25 points\n        - T=1\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=100000\n        Subtask 2: 70 points\n        - Original Constraints.\n\n        -----Example:-----\n        Input:\n\n        1\n\n        3 3\n\n        1 2\n\n        2 1\n\n        3 2\n\n        Output:\n\n        0\n\n        2\n\n        2\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        For N=3\n\n        total subsets are:\n\n        {1}\n\n        {2}\n\n        {3}\n\n        {1,2}\n\n        {1,3}\n\n        {2,3}\n\n        {1,2,3}\n\n        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.\n\n        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.\n\n        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ## Problem Restatement\n\n        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: \n           - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.\n           - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.\n\n        2. **Constraints**:\n           - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.\n           - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.\n\n        3. **Combinatorial Approach**:\n           - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:\n             - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.\n             - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.\n           - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.\n           - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.\n\n        4. **Modulo Operation**:\n           - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10^9 + 7\n            precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N\n\n            results = []\n            for each query (I, K):\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD\n                    count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        function precompute_factorials(N):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i from 2 to N:\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i from N-1 down to 1:\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        function C(n, k):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n            # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n            factorials, inverse_factorials = precompute_factorials(N, MOD)\n    \n            results = []\n            for I, K in queries:\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD)\n                    count_greater = pow(2, N-I, MOD)\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        def precompute_factorials(N, MOD):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i in range(2, N+1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i in range(N-1, 0, -1):\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        def C(n, k, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                queries = []\n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n                    queries.append((I, K))\n        \n                results.extend(calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries))\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently calculates the number of subsets for each query by precomputing factorials and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '3 3', '1 2', '2 1', '3 2'] Output: 0\n        2\n        2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

This periodicity occurs every 60 numbers, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the problem. Instead of calculating potentially massive Fibonacci numbers, we only need to consider the first 60 numbers and their last digits.\n\n    The solution involves precomputing the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. For each test case, we determine the effective length of the sequence by taking `N % 60`. If the result is zero, it means the sequence should be the full 60 numbers. We then simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains.\n\n    This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially given the large possible values of N (up to \\(10^{18}\\)).

The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \\(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots\\).\n    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: \n      \\[\n      S(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2N-1)}{6}\n      \\]\n      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.\n    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_term(N):\n        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = calculate_nth_term(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes.

This periodicity occurs every 60 numbers, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the problem. Instead of calculating potentially massive Fibonacci numbers, we only need to consider the first 60 numbers and their last digits.\n\n    The solution involves precomputing the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. For each test case, we determine the effective length of the sequence by taking `N % 60`. If the result is zero, it means the sequence should be the full 60 numbers. We then simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains.\n\n    This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially given the large possible values of N (up to \\(10^{18}\\)). The use of slicing to reduce the sequence was a straightforward and effective method to simulate the required process. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns and periodicity in sequences to optimize solutions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \\ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \\ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.\n        Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \\% 10, F_1 \\% 10, \\ldots, F_{N-1} \\% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:\n        - Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \\ldots, D_l)$.\n        - If $l = 1$, the process ends.\n        - Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \\ldots, D_{2 \\lfloor l/2 \\rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.\n        - Change $D$ to $E$.\n        When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \\rightarrow (2, 3) \\rightarrow (3)$.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n           We need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements from a sequence derived from the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. For each test case, we are given an integer N, and we need to determine the last number left after this process.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           The Fibonacci sequence has a periodic pattern in its last digits when taken modulo 10. This pattern repeats every 60 numbers. Therefore, for any N, we can determine the sequence of last digits by considering only the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. Once we have this sequence, we can simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains. This process is efficient because we only need to consider a maximum of 60 numbers, regardless of how large N is.\n\n        3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10.\n           For each test case:\n               Calculate the effective length of the sequence as N % 60.\n               If the effective length is 0, set it to 60.\n               Initialize the sequence D with the first 'effective length' elements of the precomputed sequence.\n               While the length of D is greater than 1:\n                   Create a new sequence E by taking every second element from D (even indices).\n                   Set D to E.\n               Output the single remaining element in D.\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):\n            # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10\n            fib_mod_10 = [0, 1]\n            for i in range(2, 60):\n                fib_mod_10.append((fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10)\n            return fib_mod_10[n % 60]\n\n        def find_last_remaining_number(N):\n            # Calculate the effective length of the sequence\n            effective_length = N % 60\n            if effective_length == 0:\n                effective_length = 60\n    \n            # Initialize the sequence D with the first 'effective_length' elements\n            D = [last_digit_of_fibonacci(i) for i in range(effective_length)]\n    \n            # Reduce the sequence by removing odd-indexed elements until one remains\n            while len(D) > 1:\n                D = D[1::2]  # Take every second element starting from index 1\n    \n            # Return the last remaining number\n            return D[0]\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            results = []\n    \n            for i in range(1, T + 1):\n                N = int(data[i])\n                result = find_last_remaining_number(N)\n                results.append(result)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers modulo 10, allowing us to simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements without directly computing large Fibonacci numbers.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '9'] Output: 3\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Efficient Fibonacci Calculation**:\n   - The official solution uses a fast doubling method to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. This method allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time, which is crucial given the constraints where \\( N \\) can be as large as \\( 10^{18} \\).\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**:\n   - The solution uses modular arithmetic extensively to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. The modulus \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) is a common choice in competitive programming due to its properties as a large prime number.\n\n3. **Mathematical Insight**:\n   - The solution leverages mathematical properties of Fibonacci numbers and powers to derive a formula that computes the sum efficiently. This involves using the properties of geometric series and modular inverses.\n\n4. **Handling Large Exponents**:\n   - The solution uses Python's built-in `pow` function with three arguments to perform modular exponentiation, which is efficient for large exponents.\n\n#### Why My Approach Failed\n\n- **Periodicity Misapplication**: My approach relied on the periodicity of Fibonacci numbers modulo 10, which was not sufficient for the problem's requirements. The official solution does not rely on this periodicity but instead uses a more general mathematical approach.\n  \n- **Incorrect Handling of Large Numbers**: My solution did not handle large numbers and exponents correctly, leading to incorrect results. The official solution's use of modular arithmetic and fast doubling ensures that calculations remain within bounds.\n\n- **Complexity**: My approach was not efficient enough for the given constraints, especially with large \\( N \\) and \\( K \\). The official solution's use of logarithmic time complexity for Fibonacci calculation and efficient handling of powers is more suitable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe official solution provides a more robust and efficient approach to solving the problem by leveraging mathematical insights and efficient algorithms. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the mathematical properties of the problem and using efficient algorithms to handle large inputs."
