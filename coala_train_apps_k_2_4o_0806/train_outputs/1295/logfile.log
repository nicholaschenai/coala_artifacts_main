INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a number of queries, Q. Each query consists of two integers, N and K. For each query, we need to calculate the sum S(N, K) which is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers modulo K. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2) for i >= 2

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so calculating it directly for large N is inefficient. However, we only need the sum modulo K, which can be simplified using properties of modular arithmetic.

2. **Use Pisano Period**: The Fibonacci sequence modulo any number K is periodic, known as the Pisano period. This means that after a certain number of terms, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo K repeats. We can use this property to reduce the computation for large N.

3. **Calculate Pisano Period**: For each query, calculate the Pisano period for the given K. This will help us determine how the Fibonacci sequence behaves under modulo K.

4. **Sum within Pisano Period**: Once the Pisano period is known, calculate the sum of Fibonacci numbers within one full period. Use this to compute the sum for N terms by considering how many full periods fit into N and the remainder.

5. **Compute Result for Each Query**: For each query, use the Pisano period and the precomputed sums to quickly calculate the result S(N, K).

## Pseudocode

```
function pisano_period(k):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i from 0 to k*k:
        a, b = b, (a + b) % k
        if a == 0 and b == 1:
            return i + 1

function fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):
    period = pisano_period(k)
    full_periods = n // period
    remainder = n % period
    
    fib_mod = [0, 1]
    for i from 2 to period:
        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)
    
    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k
    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k
    
    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k

function main():
    read Q
    for each query:
        read N, K
        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def pisano_period(k):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(k * k):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % k
        if a == 0 and b == 1:
            return i + 1

def fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):
    period = pisano_period(k)
    full_periods = n // period
    remainder = n % period
    
    fib_mod = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, period):
        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)
    
    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k
    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k
    
    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution efficiently calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers modulo K for each query by leveraging the periodic nature of the Fibonacci sequence under modulo operations.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key insight was recognizing the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity occurs every 60 numbers, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the problem. Instead of calculating potentially massive Fibonacci numbers, we only need to consider the first 60 numbers and their last digits.

    The solution involves precomputing the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. For each test case, we determine the effective length of the sequence by taking `N % 60`. If the result is zero, it means the sequence should be the full 60 numbers. We then simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains.

    This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially given the large possible values of N (up to \(10^{18}\)). The use of slicing to reduce the sequence was a straightforward and effective method to simulate the required process. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns and periodicity in sequences to optimize solutions.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: 
           - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.
           - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.

        2. **Constraints**:
           - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.
           - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.

        3. **Combinatorial Approach**:
           - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:
             - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.
             - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.
           - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.
           - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.

        4. **Modulo Operation**:
           - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):
            MOD = 10^9 + 7
            precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N

            results = []
            for each query (I, K):
                if K > I or K > N:
                    results.append(0)
                else:
                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD
                    count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD
                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD
                    results.append(result)
            return results

        function precompute_factorials(N):
            factorials = [1] * (N+1)
            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)
            for i from 2 to N:
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD
            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)
            for i from N-1 down to 1:
                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD
            return factorials, inverse_factorials

        function C(n, k):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two integers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- \( F_0 = 0 \)
- \( F_1 = 1 \)
- \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

Given the constraints, \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), which means we need an efficient way to compute this sum.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Periodicity**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity can be used to reduce the problem size significantly.

2. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   - For each query, determine the effective number of Fibonacci numbers to consider by taking \( N \mod 60 \).
   - Compute the sum of these numbers raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Handling Large Exponents**: Use modular exponentiation to efficiently compute powers, especially since \( K \) can be very large.

## Pseudocode

    Initialize an array fib_mod_10 of size 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1

        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp = exp // 2
    return result

function S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    for i from 0 to (N % 60) - 1:

We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two integers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- \( F_0 = 0 \)
- \( F_1 = 1 \)
- \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

Given the constraints, \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), which means we need an efficient way to compute this sum.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Periodicity**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity can be used to reduce the problem size significantly.

2. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   - For each query, determine the effective number of Fibonacci numbers to consider by taking \( N \mod 60 \).
   - Compute the sum of these numbers raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Handling Large Exponents**: Use modular exponentiation to efficiently compute powers, especially since \( K \) can be very large.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F_0 = 0 \)
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

2. **Sum Definition**: We need to compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) which is the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Constraints**: Both \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), so we need to use properties like periodicity and modular arithmetic to handle these large numbers efficiently.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This is a known property and is correct.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: This is used to compute powers efficiently, especially when \( K \) is large.

3. **Mistake Identification**:
   - The issue seems to be with the computation of the sum \( S(N, K) \). The expected output for the test case with input \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \) should be 1, but the code outputs 0.
   - The problem might be in how the sum is computed or how the periodicity is applied.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Correct Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum should include the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).
   - Ensure that the loop correctly iterates over the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo 60.

2. **Re-evaluate the Loop**:
   - The loop should iterate over the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles the case when \( N \) is small.

3. **Re-check the Base Case**:
   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

Let's correct the code with these considerations in mind.

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, 60):
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

def modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
    return result

def S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    # We need to consider the first N Fibonacci numbers
    # If N is larger than 60, we only need to consider N % 60 due to periodicity
    for i in range(N % 60):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(S(N, K))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised solution should correctly compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) by ensuring that the loop iterates over the correct number of Fibonacci numbers and correctly applies the periodicity of the sequence.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two integers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- \( F_0 = 0 \)
- \( F_1 = 1 \)
- \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

Given the constraints, \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), which means we need an efficient way to compute this sum.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Periodicity**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity can be used to reduce the problem size significantly.

2. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   - For each query, determine the effective number of Fibonacci numbers to consider by taking \( N \mod 60 \).
   - Compute the sum of these numbers raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Handling Large Exponents**: Use modular exponentiation to efficiently compute powers, especially since \( K \) can be very large.

## Pseudocode

```
function compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    Initialize an array fib_mod_10 of size 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i from 2 to 59:
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

function modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp = exp // 2
    return result

function S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    for i from 0 to (N % 60) - 1:
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

function main():
    Read integer Q
    for each query:
        Read integers N and K
        Print S(N, K)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, 60):
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

        exp //= 2
    return result

        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []

    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution efficiently computes the required sum for each query by leveraging the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and using modular exponentiation to handle large powers.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F_0 = 0 \)
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

2. **Sum Definition**: We need to compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) which is the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Constraints**: Both \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), so we need to use properties like periodicity and modular arithmetic to handle these large numbers efficiently.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This is a known property and is correct.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: This is used to compute powers efficiently, especially when \( K \) is large.

3. **Mistake Identification**:
   - The issue seems to be with the computation of the sum \( S(N, K) \). The expected output for the test case with input \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \) should be 1, but the code outputs 0.
   - The problem might be in how the sum is computed or how the periodicity is applied.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Correct Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum should include the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).
   - Ensure that the loop correctly iterates over the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo 60.

2. **Re-evaluate the Loop**:
   - The loop should iterate over the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles the case when \( N \) is small.

3. **Re-check the Base Case**:
   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

Let's correct the code with these considerations in mind.

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, 60):
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

def modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
    return result

def S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    # We need to consider the first N Fibonacci numbers
    # If N is larger than 60, we only need to consider N % 60 due to periodicity
    for i in range(N % 60):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(S(N, K))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised solution should correctly compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) by ensuring that the loop iterates over the correct number of Fibonacci numbers and correctly applies the periodicity of the sequence.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key insight was recognizing the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity occurs every 60 numbers, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the problem. Instead of calculating potentially massive Fibonacci numbers, we only need to consider the first 60 numbers and their last digits.

    The solution involves precomputing the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. For each test case, we determine the effective length of the sequence by taking `N % 60`. If the result is zero, it means the sequence should be the full 60 numbers. We then simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains.

    This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially given the large possible values of N (up to \(10^{18}\)). The use of slicing to reduce the sequence was a straightforward and effective method to simulate the required process. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns and periodicity in sequences to optimize solutions.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
      \[
      S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
      \]
      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

    ### Strategy:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_nth_term(N):
        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_nth_term(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two integers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- \( F_0 = 0 \)
- \( F_1 = 1 \)
- \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

Given the constraints, \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), which means we need an efficient way to compute this sum.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Periodicity**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity can be used to reduce the problem size significantly.

2. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   - For each query, determine the effective number of Fibonacci numbers to consider by taking \( N \mod 60 \).
   - Compute the sum of these numbers raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Handling Large Exponents**: Use modular exponentiation to efficiently compute powers, especially since \( K \) can be very large.

## Pseudocode

```
function compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    Initialize an array fib_mod_10 of size 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i from 2 to 59:
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

function modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp = exp // 2
    return result

function S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    for i from 0 to (N % 60) - 1:
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

function main():
    Read integer Q
    for each query:
        Read integers N and K
        Print S(N, K)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, 60):
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

def modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
    return result

def S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    for i in range(N % 60):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])

    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution efficiently computes the required sum for each query by leveraging the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and using modular exponentiation to handle large powers.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F_0 = 0 \)
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

2. **Sum Definition**: We need to compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) which is the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Constraints**: Both \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), so we need to use properties like periodicity and modular arithmetic to handle these large numbers efficiently.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This is a known property and is correct.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: This is used to compute powers efficiently, especially when \( K \) is large.

3. **Mistake Identification**:
   - The issue seems to be with the computation of the sum \( S(N, K) \). The expected output for the test case with input \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \) should be 1, but the code outputs 0.
   - The problem might be in how the sum is computed or how the periodicity is applied.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Correct Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum should include the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).
   - Ensure that the loop correctly iterates over the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo 60.

2. **Re-evaluate the Loop**:
   - The loop should iterate over the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles the case when \( N \) is small.

3. **Re-check the Base Case**:
   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

Let's correct the code with these considerations in mind.

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, 60):
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

def modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
    return result

def S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    # We need to consider the first N Fibonacci numbers
    # If N is larger than 60, we only need to consider N % 60 due to periodicity
    for i in range(N % 60):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(S(N, K))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised solution should correctly compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) by ensuring that the loop iterates over the correct number of Fibonacci numbers and correctly applies the periodicity of the sequence.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's fix the solution by ensuring that the sum \( S(N, K) \) is computed correctly. The key is to correctly handle the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and ensure that the loop iterates over the correct number of Fibonacci numbers.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60

    fib_mod_10[1] = 1

    # We need to consider the first N Fibonacci numbers
    # If N is larger than 60, we only need to consider N % 60 due to periodicity
    num_fib_to_consider = N % 60 if N % 60 != 0 else 60
    for i in range(num_fib_to_consider):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(S(N, K))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Fixes:
- **Correct Loop Range**: The loop now correctly considers the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, or all 60 if \( N \% 60 \) is zero, which accounts for the full cycle.
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum is calculated by raising each relevant Fibonacci number to the power of \( K \) and taking the result modulo 10, ensuring the final sum is also modulo 10.

This should correctly compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) for each query.

        num_fib_to_consider = 60

- \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

Given the constraints, \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), which means we need an efficient way to compute this sum.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Periodicity**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity can be used to reduce the problem size significantly.

2. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   - For each query, determine the effective number of Fibonacci numbers to consider by taking \( N \mod 60 \).
   - Compute the sum of these numbers raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Handling Large Exponents**: Use modular exponentiation to efficiently compute powers, especially since \( K \) can be very large.

## Pseudocode

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F_0 = 0 \)
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

2. **Sum Definition**: We need to compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) which is the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Constraints**: Both \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), so we need to use properties like periodicity and modular arithmetic to handle these large numbers efficiently.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This is a known property and is correct.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: This is used to compute powers efficiently, especially when \( K \) is large.

3. **Mistake Identification**:
   - The issue seems to be with the computation of the sum \( S(N, K) \). The expected output for the test case with input \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \) should be 1, but the code outputs 0.
   - The problem might be in how the sum is computed or how the periodicity is applied.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Correct Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum should include the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).
   - Ensure that the loop correctly iterates over the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo 60.

2. **Re-evaluate the Loop**:
   - The loop should iterate over the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles the case when \( N \) is small.

3. **Re-check the Base Case**:
   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

Let's correct the code with these considerations in mind.

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0

    return fib_mod_10

def modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
    return result

def S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    # We need to consider the first N Fibonacci numbers
    # If N is larger than 60, we only need to consider N % 60 due to periodicity
    for i in range(N % 60):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key insight was recognizing the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity occurs every 60 numbers, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the problem. Instead of calculating potentially massive Fibonacci numbers, we only need to consider the first 60 numbers and their last digits.

    The solution involves precomputing the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. For each test case, we determine the effective length of the sequence by taking `N % 60`. If the result is zero, it means the sequence should be the full 60 numbers. We then simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains.

    This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially given the large possible values of N (up to \(10^{18}\)). The use of slicing to reduce the sequence was a straightforward and effective method to simulate the required process. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns and periodicity in sequences to optimize solutions.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
        Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
        - Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
        - If $l = 1$, the process ends.
        - Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
        - Change $D$ to $E$.
        When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the last remaining number.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

        -----Subtasks-----
        Subtask #1 (20 points):
        - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le N \le 10^7$
        Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

        -----Example Input-----
        1
        9

        -----Example Output-----
        3

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements from a sequence derived from the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. For each test case, we are given an integer N, and we need to determine the last number left after this process.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           The Fibonacci sequence has a periodic pattern in its last digits when taken modulo 10. This pattern repeats every 60 numbers. Therefore, for any N, we can determine the sequence of last digits by considering only the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. Once we have this sequence, we can simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains. This process is efficient because we only need to consider a maximum of 60 numbers, regardless of how large N is.

        3. **Pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10.
           For each test case:
               Calculate the effective length of the sequence as N % 60.
               If the effective length is 0, set it to 60.
               Initialize the sequence D with the first 'effective length' elements of the precomputed sequence.
               While the length of D is greater than 1:
                   Create a new sequence E by taking every second element from D (even indices).
                   Set D to E.
               Output the single remaining element in D.
           ```

### Explanation of the Fixes:
- **Correct Loop Range**: The loop now correctly considers the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, or all 60 if \( N \% 60 \) is zero, which accounts for the full cycle.
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum is calculated by raising each relevant Fibonacci number to the power of \( K \) and taking the result modulo 10, ensuring the final sum is also modulo 10.

This should correctly compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) for each query.

 Let's address the issue with the current solution. The problem seems to be with how the sum \( S(N, K) \) is calculated. The key insight is to correctly handle the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and ensure that the loop iterates over the correct number of Fibonacci numbers.

### Key Insight

The mistake is in the handling of the periodicity. When \( N \% 60 = 0 \), it should consider the full cycle of 60 numbers, not zero numbers. This was incorrectly handled in the previous solution.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python

    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0

        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
    return result

    sum = 0
    # We need to consider the first N Fibonacci numbers
    # If N is larger than 60, we only need to consider N % 60 due to periodicity
    num_fib_to_consider = N % 60
    if num_fib_to_consider == 0:
        num_fib_to_consider = 60
    for i in range(num_fib_to_consider):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

def main():
    import sys

    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two integers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- \( F_0 = 0 \)
- \( F_1 = 1 \)
- \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

Given the constraints, \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), which means we need an efficient way to compute this sum.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Periodicity**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity can be used to reduce the problem size significantly.

2. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   - For each query, determine the effective number of Fibonacci numbers to consider by taking \( N \mod 60 \).
   - Compute the sum of these numbers raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Handling Large Exponents**: Use modular exponentiation to efficiently compute powers, especially since \( K \) can be very large.

## Pseudocode

```
function compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    Initialize an array fib_mod_10 of size 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i from 2 to 59:
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

function modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp = exp // 2
    return result

function S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    for i from 0 to (N % 60) - 1:
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

function main():
    Read integer Q
    for each query:
        Read integers N and K
        Print S(N, K)
```

    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F_0 = 0 \)
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

2. **Sum Definition**: We need to compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) which is the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Constraints**: Both \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), so we need to use properties like periodicity and modular arithmetic to handle these large numbers efficiently.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This is a known property and is correct.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: This is used to compute powers efficiently, especially when \( K \) is large.

3. **Mistake Identification**:
   - The issue seems to be with the computation of the sum \( S(N, K) \). The expected output for the test case with input \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \) should be 1, but the code outputs 0.
   - The problem might be in how the sum is computed or how the periodicity is applied.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Correct Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum should include the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).
   - Ensure that the loop correctly iterates over the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo 60.

2. **Re-evaluate the Loop**:
   - The loop should iterate over the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles the case when \( N \) is small.

3. **Re-check the Base Case**:
   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

Let's correct the code with these considerations in mind.

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1

    for i in range(N % 60):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10

def main():

    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])

   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

### Key Insight

The mistake is in the handling of the periodicity. When \( N \% 60 = 0 \), it should consider the full cycle of 60 numbers, not zero numbers. This was incorrectly handled in the previous solution.

Let's correct the code with these considerations in mind.

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, 60):
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

    result = 1
    while exp > 0:

            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
    return result

    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    # We need to consider the first N Fibonacci numbers
    # If N is larger than 60, we only need to consider N % 60 due to periodicity
    num_fib_to_consider = N % 60
    if num_fib_to_consider == 0:
        num_fib_to_consider = 60
    for i in range(num_fib_to_consider):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2

    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Fixes:
- **Correct Loop Range**: The loop now correctly considers the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, or all 60 if \( N \% 60 \) is zero, which accounts for the full cycle.
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum is calculated by raising each relevant Fibonacci number to the power of \( K \) and taking the result modulo 10, ensuring the final sum is also modulo 10.

This should correctly compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) for each query.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's address the issue with the current solution. The problem seems to be with how the sum \( S(N, K) \) is calculated. The key insight is to correctly handle the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and ensure that the loop iterates over the correct number of Fibonacci numbers.

### Key Insight

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Let's carefully analyze the problem and the solution to identify the mistake.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F_0 = 0 \)
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

2. **Sum Definition**: We need to compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) which is the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Constraints**: Both \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), so we need to use properties like periodicity and modular arithmetic to handle these large numbers efficiently.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This is a known property and is correct.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: This is used to compute powers efficiently, especially when \( K \) is large.

3. **Mistake Identification**:
   - The issue seems to be with the computation of the sum \( S(N, K) \). The expected output for the test case with input \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \) should be 1, but the code outputs 0.
   - The problem might be in how the sum is computed or how the periodicity is applied.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Correct Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum should include the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).
   - Ensure that the loop correctly iterates over the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo 60.

2. **Re-evaluate the Loop**:
   - The loop should iterate over the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles the case when \( N \) is small.

3. **Re-check the Base Case**:
   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

### Key Insight

The mistake is in the handling of the periodicity. When \( N \% 60 = 0 \), it should consider the full cycle of 60 numbers, not zero numbers. This was incorrectly handled in the previous solution.

### Correction

The main issue is that the Fibonacci sequence starts with \( F_0 = 0 \) and \( F_1 = 1 \). When \( N = 1 \), we should only consider \( F_1 \), not \( F_0 \).

Let's correct the code with these considerations in mind.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two integers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- \( F_0 = 0 \)
- \( F_1 = 1 \)
- \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

Given the constraints, \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), which means we need an efficient way to compute this sum.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Periodicity**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity can be used to reduce the problem size significantly.

2. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   - For each query, determine the effective number of Fibonacci numbers to consider by taking \( N \mod 60 \).
   - Compute the sum of these numbers raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Handling Large Exponents**: Use modular exponentiation to efficiently compute powers, especially since \( K \) can be very large.

## Pseudocode

```

    Initialize an array fib_mod_10 of size 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1

        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

    result = 1

        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp = exp // 2
    return result

function S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F_0 = 0 \)
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

3. **Mistake Identification**:
   - The issue seems to be with the computation of the sum \( S(N, K) \). The expected output for the test case with input \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \) should be 1, but the code outputs 0.
   - The problem might be in how the sum is computed or how the periodicity is applied.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Correct Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum should include the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).
   - Ensure that the loop correctly iterates over the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo 60.

2. **Re-evaluate the Loop**:
   - The loop should iterate over the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles the case when \( N \) is small.

3. **Re-check the Base Case**:
   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's fix the solution by ensuring that the sum \( S(N, K) \) is computed correctly. The key is to correctly handle the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and ensure that the loop iterates over the correct number of Fibonacci numbers.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python

### Explanation of the Fixes:
- **Correct Loop Range**: The loop now correctly considers the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, or all 60 if \( N \% 60 \) is zero, which accounts for the full cycle.
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum is calculated by raising each relevant Fibonacci number to the power of \( K \) and taking the result modulo 10, ensuring the final sum is also modulo 10.

This should correctly compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) for each query.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's carefully analyze the problem and the solution to identify the mistake.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F_0 = 0 \)
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

2. **Sum Definition**: We need to compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) which is the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Constraints**: Both \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), so we need to use properties like periodicity and modular arithmetic to handle these large numbers efficiently.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This is a known property and is correct.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: This is used to compute powers efficiently, especially when \( K \) is large.

3. **Mistake Identification**:
   - The issue seems to be with the computation of the sum \( S(N, K) \). The expected output for the test case with input \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \) should be 1, but the code outputs 0.
   - The problem might be in how the sum is computed or how the periodicity is applied.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Correct Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum should include the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).
   - Ensure that the loop correctly iterates over the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo 60.

2. **Re-evaluate the Loop**:
   - The loop should iterate over the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles the case when \( N \) is small.

3. **Re-check the Base Case**:
   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

### Key Insight

The mistake is in the handling of the periodicity. When \( N \% 60 = 0 \), it should consider the full cycle of 60 numbers, not zero numbers. This was incorrectly handled in the previous solution.

Let's correct the code with these considerations in mind.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key insight was recognizing the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity occurs every 60 numbers, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the problem. Instead of calculating potentially massive Fibonacci numbers, we only need to consider the first 60 numbers and their last digits.

    The solution involves precomputing the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. For each test case, we determine the effective length of the sequence by taking `N % 60`. If the result is zero, it means the sequence should be the full 60 numbers. We then simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains.

    This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially given the large possible values of N (up to \(10^{18}\)). The use of slicing to reduce the sequence was a straightforward and effective method to simulate the required process. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns and periodicity in sequences to optimize solutions.
[/Summary]


[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
        Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
        - Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
        - If $l = 1$, the process ends.
        - Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
        - Change $D$ to $E$.
        When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the last remaining number.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

        -----Subtasks-----
        Subtask #1 (20 points):
        - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le N \le 10^7$
        Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

        -----Example Input-----
        1
        9

        -----Example Output-----
        3

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements from a sequence derived from the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. For each test case, we are given an integer N, and we need to determine the last number left after this process.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           The Fibonacci sequence has a periodic pattern in its last digits when taken modulo 10. This pattern repeats every 60 numbers. Therefore, for any N, we can determine the sequence of last digits by considering only the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. Once we have this sequence, we can simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains. This process is efficient because we only need to consider a maximum of 60 numbers, regardless of how large N is.

        3. **Pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10.
           For each test case:
               Calculate the effective length of the sequence as N % 60.
               If the effective length is 0, set it to 60.
               Initialize the sequence D with the first 'effective length' elements of the precomputed sequence.
               While the length of D is greater than 1:
                   Create a new sequence E by taking every second element from D (even indices).
                   Set D to E.
               Output the single remaining element in D.
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
            # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10
            fib_mod_10 = [0, 1]
            for i in range(2, 60):
                fib_mod_10.append((fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10)
            return fib_mod_10[n % 60]

        def find_last_remaining_number(N):
            # Calculate the effective length of the sequence
            effective_length = N % 60
            if effective_length == 0:
                effective_length = 60
    
            # Initialize the sequence D with the first 'effective_length' elements
            D = [last_digit_of_fibonacci(i) for i in range(effective_length)]
    
            # Reduce the sequence by removing odd-indexed elements until one remains
            while len(D) > 1:
                D = D[1::2]  # Take every second element starting from index 1
    
            # Return the last remaining number
            return D[0]

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":

        This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers modulo 10, allowing us to simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements without directly computing large Fibonacci numbers.

The key insight is to correctly handle the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and ensure that the loop iterates over the correct number of Fibonacci numbers.

### Key Insight

The mistake is in the handling of the periodicity. When \( N \% 60 = 0 \), it should consider the full cycle of 60 numbers, not zero numbers. This was incorrectly handled in the previous solution.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, 60):
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

def modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
    return result

def S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    # We need to consider the first N Fibonacci numbers
    # If N is larger than 60, we only need to consider N % 60 due to periodicity
    num_fib_to_consider = N % 60
    if num_fib_to_consider == 0:
        num_fib_to_consider = 60
    for i in range(num_fib_to_consider):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(S(N, K))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Fixes:
- **Correct Loop Range**: The loop now correctly considers the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, or all 60 if \( N \% 60 \) is zero, which accounts for the full cycle.
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum is calculated by raising each relevant Fibonacci number to the power of \( K \) and taking the result modulo 10, ensuring the final sum is also modulo 10.

This should correctly compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) for each query.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two integers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- \( F_0 = 0 \)
- \( F_1 = 1 \)
- \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

Given the constraints, \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), which means we need an efficient way to compute this sum.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Periodicity**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity can be used to reduce the problem size significantly.

2. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   - For each query, determine the effective number of Fibonacci numbers to consider by taking \( N \mod 60 \).
   - Compute the sum of these numbers raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Handling Large Exponents**: Use modular exponentiation to efficiently compute powers, especially since \( K \) can be very large.

## Pseudocode

```
function compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    Initialize an array fib_mod_10 of size 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i from 2 to 59:
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

function modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp = exp // 2
    return result

function S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    for i from 0 to (N % 60) - 1:
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

function main():
    Read integer Q
    for each query:
        Read integers N and K
        Print S(N, K)

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F_0 = 0 \)
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

2. **Sum Definition**: We need to compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) which is the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Constraints**: Both \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), so we need to use properties like periodicity and modular arithmetic to handle these large numbers efficiently.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This is a known property and is correct.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: This is used to compute powers efficiently, especially when \( K \) is large.

3. **Mistake Identification**:
   - The issue seems to be with the computation of the sum \( S(N, K) \). The expected output for the test case with input \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \) should be 1, but the code outputs 0.
   - The problem might be in how the sum is computed or how the periodicity is applied.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Correct Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum should include the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).
   - Ensure that the loop correctly iterates over the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo 60.

2. **Re-evaluate the Loop**:
   - The loop should iterate over the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles the case when \( N \) is small.

3. **Re-check the Base Case**:
   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

Let's correct the code with these considerations in mind.

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1

        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

def modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
    return result

def S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    # We need to consider the first N Fibonacci numbers
    # If N is larger than 60, we only need to consider N % 60 due to periodicity
    for i in range(N % 60):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2

### Explanation of the Fixes:
- **Correct Loop Range**: The loop now correctly considers the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, or all 60 if \( N \% 60 \) is zero, which accounts for the full cycle.
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum is calculated by raising each relevant Fibonacci number to the power of \( K \) and taking the result modulo 10, ensuring the final sum is also modulo 10.

This should correctly compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) for each query.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's carefully analyze the problem and the solution to identify the mistake.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F_0 = 0 \)
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

2. **Sum Definition**: We need to compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) which is the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Constraints**: Both \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), so we need to use properties like periodicity and modular arithmetic to handle these large numbers efficiently.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This is a known property and is correct.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: This is used to compute powers efficiently, especially when \( K \) is large.

3. **Mistake Identification**:
   - The issue seems to be with the computation of the sum \( S(N, K) \). The expected output for the test case with input \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \) should be 1, but the code outputs 0.
   - The problem might be in how the sum is computed or how the periodicity is applied.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Correct Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum should include the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).
   - Ensure that the loop correctly iterates over the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo 60.

2. **Re-evaluate the Loop**:
   - The loop should iterate over the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles the case when \( N \) is small.

3. **Re-check the Base Case**:
   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

### Key Insight

The mistake is in the handling of the periodicity. When \( N \% 60 = 0 \), it should consider the full cycle of 60 numbers, not zero numbers. This was incorrectly handled in the previous solution.

Let's correct the code with these considerations in mind.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Fibonacci Sum Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem involves calculating a sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to a power, which tests understanding of:
- Fibonacci sequence properties, particularly periodicity when taken modulo a number.
- Efficient computation techniques for large numbers, such as modular arithmetic and modular exponentiation.

#### Strategies and Challenges
1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The Fibonacci sequence's last digits repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity allows us to reduce the problem size significantly by only considering the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: Given the large possible values for \( K \), using modular exponentiation is crucial for efficiently computing powers without overflow.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The main challenge was correctly handling the periodicity, especially when \( N \% 60 = 0 \). Initially, the solution incorrectly handled this case, leading to incorrect results for small \( N \).

#### Fixes and Insights
- **Correct Loop Range**: Ensure the loop iterates over the correct number of Fibonacci numbers. When \( N \% 60 = 0 \), consider the full cycle of 60 numbers.
- **Base Case Handling**: For small \( N \), ensure the correct Fibonacci numbers are considered, especially distinguishing between \( F_0 \) and \( F_1 \).

#### Code Snippet
```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, 60):
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

def modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
    return result

def S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    num_fib_to_consider = N % 60
    if num_fib_to_consider == 0:
        num_fib_to_consider = 60
    for i in range(num_fib_to_consider):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum
```

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two integers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- \( F_0 = 0 \)
- \( F_1 = 1 \)
- \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

Given the constraints, \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), which means we need an efficient way to compute this sum.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Periodicity**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity can be used to reduce the problem size significantly.

2. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   - For each query, determine the effective number of Fibonacci numbers to consider by taking \( N \mod 60 \).
   - Compute the sum of these numbers raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Handling Large Exponents**: Use modular exponentiation to efficiently compute powers, especially since \( K \) can be very large.

## Pseudocode

```
function compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    Initialize an array fib_mod_10 of size 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1

        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

function modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp = exp // 2
    return result

function S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F_0 = 0 \)
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

2. **Sum Definition**: We need to compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) which is the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).

3. **Constraints**: Both \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), so we need to use properties like periodicity and modular arithmetic to handle these large numbers efficiently.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This is a known property and is correct.

2. **Modular Exponentiation**: This is used to compute powers efficiently, especially when \( K \) is large.

3. **Mistake Identification**:
   - The issue seems to be with the computation of the sum \( S(N, K) \). The expected output for the test case with input \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \) should be 1, but the code outputs 0.
   - The problem might be in how the sum is computed or how the periodicity is applied.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Correct Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum should include the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \).
   - Ensure that the loop correctly iterates over the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo 60.

2. **Re-evaluate the Loop**:
   - The loop should iterate over the first \( N \% 60 \) Fibonacci numbers, but we need to ensure that it correctly handles the case when \( N \) is small.

3. **Re-check the Base Case**:
   - For \( N = 1 \), the sum should be the first Fibonacci number raised to the power of \( K \).

Let's correct the code with these considerations in mind.

```python
def compute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    fib_mod_10 = [0] * 60
    fib_mod_10[0] = 0
    fib_mod_10[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, 60):
        fib_mod_10[i] = (fib_mod_10[i-1] + fib_mod_10[i-2]) % 10
    return fib_mod_10

def modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
    return result

def S(N, K):
    fib_mod_10 = compute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    sum = 0
    # We need to consider the first N Fibonacci numbers
    # If N is larger than 60, we only need to consider N % 60 due to periodicity
    for i in range(N % 60):
        sum = (sum + modular_exponentiation(fib_mod_10[i], K, 10)) % 10
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(S(N, K))
    
    for result in results:

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution

1. **Efficient Fibonacci Calculation**:
   - The official solution uses a fast doubling method to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. This method allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time, which is crucial given the constraints where \( N \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \).

2. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The solution uses modular arithmetic extensively to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. The modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) is a common choice in competitive programming due to its properties as a large prime number.

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The solution leverages mathematical properties of Fibonacci numbers and powers to derive a formula that computes the sum efficiently. This involves using the properties of geometric series and modular inverses.

4. **Handling Large Exponents**:
   - The solution uses Python's built-in `pow` function with three arguments to perform modular exponentiation, which is efficient for large exponents.

#### Why My Approach Failed

- **Periodicity Misapplication**: My approach relied on the periodicity of Fibonacci numbers modulo 10, which was not sufficient for the problem's requirements. The official solution does not rely on this periodicity but instead uses a more general mathematical approach.
  
- **Incorrect Handling of Large Numbers**: My solution did not handle large numbers and exponents correctly, leading to incorrect results. The official solution's use of modular arithmetic and fast doubling ensures that calculations remain within bounds.

- **Complexity**: My approach was not efficient enough for the given constraints, especially with large \( N \) and \( K \). The official solution's use of logarithmic time complexity for Fibonacci calculation and efficient handling of powers is more suitable.

### Conclusion

The official solution provides a more robust and efficient approach to solving the problem by leveraging mathematical insights and efficient algorithms. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the mathematical properties of the problem and using efficient algorithms to handle large inputs.
