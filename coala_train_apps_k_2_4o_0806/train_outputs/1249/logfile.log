## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a number of test cases. For each test case, we have two integers, N and K. We need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair in the permutation equals K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):** 
   - For a permutation P of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair in the permutation.
   - For example, if P = [p1, p2, ..., pN], then f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

2. **Constraints and Observations:**
   - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.
   - The minimum possible value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.

3. **Approach:**
   - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

4. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - Start with the permutation [N, N-1, ..., 1].
   - Calculate the current sum of maximums.
   - If the current sum is greater than K, swap elements to reduce the sum until it equals K.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(N, K):
    max_sum = N + (N-1) + ... + 2
    min_sum = N - 1
    
    if K < min_sum or K > max_sum:
        return -1
    
    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
    current_sum = max_sum
    
    for i from 0 to N-2:
        if current_sum == K:
            break
        # Try to reduce the sum by swapping
        for j from N-1 down to i+1:
            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                swap(permutation[i], permutation[j])
                break
    
    return permutation

read T
for each test case:
    read N, K
    result = find_permutation(N, K)
    print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_permutation(N, K):
    # Calculate the maximum and minimum possible sums
    max_sum = sum(range(2, N + 1))
    min_sum = N - 1
    
    # If K is out of the possible range, return -1
    if K < min_sum or K > max_sum:
        return -1
    
    # Start with the permutation in decreasing order
    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
    current_sum = max_sum
    
    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
    for i in range(N - 1):
        if current_sum == K:
            break
        # Try to reduce the sum by swapping
        for j in range(N - 1, i, -1):
            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]
                break
    
    return permutation

import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    K = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    result = find_permutation(N, K)
    if result == -1:
        results.append("-1")
    else:
        results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))

sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the required permutation or -1 if no valid permutation exists. The function `find_permutation` constructs the permutation by starting with the maximum possible sum and adjusting it to match K.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.

        This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

        Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

        But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

        First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

        As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

        The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

        Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

        Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

        Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

        Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!


        -----Input-----

        Each test contains multiple test cases.

        The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

        The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

        The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

        $i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

        It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


        -----Output-----

        For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.


        -----Example-----
        Input
        3
        3 0
        1 3 2

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ## Problem Restatement

        We have a sequence of Pok√©mon, each with a distinct strength. We want to form an army by selecting a subsequence of these Pok√©mon such that the alternating sum of their strengths is maximized. The alternating sum is calculated as follows: the first element is added, the second is subtracted, the third is added, and so on. We need to determine the maximum possible alternating sum for the given sequence of Pok√©mon strengths.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Alternating Sum**: The alternating sum of a sequence is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. For example, for a sequence `[a, b, c, d]`, the alternating sum is `a - b + c - d`.

        2. **Maximizing Alternating Sum**: To maximize the alternating sum, we should try to include the largest possible values at the positions where they are added and the smallest possible values at the positions where they are subtracted.

        3. **Strategy**:
           - Traverse the list of strengths.
           - Maintain two variables: `max_odd` and `max_even` to keep track of the maximum alternating sum ending at an odd and even index respectively.
           - For each strength, decide whether to add it to the current alternating sum or start a new subsequence.
           - Update `max_odd` and `max_even` accordingly.

        4. **Iterate through the list**:
           - If the index is odd, update `max_odd` by considering the current strength added to `max_even`.
           - If the index is even, update `max_even` by considering the current strength subtracted from `max_odd`.

        5. **Result**: The maximum of `max_odd` and `max_even` at the end of the iteration will be the answer.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function max_alternating_sum(strengths):
            max_odd = 0
            max_even = 0
    
            for i from 0 to length of strengths - 1:
                if i is even:
                    max_even = max(max_even, max_odd + strengths[i])
                else:
                    max_odd = max(max_odd, max_even - strengths[i])
    
            return max(max_odd, max_even)

        function main():
            read number of test cases t
            for each test case:
                read n and q (q is always 0 in this problem)
                read the list of strengths
                print max_alternating_sum(strengths)
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
            max_odd = 0
            max_even = 0

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of numbers from 1 to N, and we need to find a permutation of these numbers such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair is equal to a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: 
   - For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN), the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair: max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

2. **Constraints and Observations**:
   - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.
   - The minimum possible value of f(P) is the sum of the smallest N-1 numbers, i.e., 2 + 3 + ... + N.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P) for the given N.
   - If K is greater than this maximum, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.
   - If K is less than the minimum possible value, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.
   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - Start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible f(P).
   - Adjust the permutation to decrease the sum to K by swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(N, K):
    max_possible = sum of largest N-1 numbers
    min_possible = sum of smallest N-1 numbers
    
    if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:
        return -1
    
    permutation = list of numbers from N to 1 (descending order)
    current_sum = max_possible
    
    for i from 0 to N-2:
        if current_sum == K:
            break
        for j from N-1 down to i+1:
            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                swap permutation[i] and permutation[j]
                break
    
    return permutation

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. The core concept here was understanding the function f(P) and how to manipulate permutations to achieve a specific sum.

The key strategy was to start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum of maximums, and then adjust it to decrease the sum to the desired K. This involved swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum while ensuring the sum does not drop below K.

One important realization was calculating the maximum and minimum possible values of f(P) for a given N. If K was outside this range, it was impossible to achieve, and the output should be -1. This check helped quickly eliminate impossible cases.

The solution involved iterating over the permutation and making swaps to adjust the sum. This approach was efficient and worked well within the constraints, as evidenced by the successful test results. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation properties and how to manipulate them to achieve specific outcomes.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of numbers from 1 to N, and we need to find a permutation of these numbers such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair is equal to a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: 
   - For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN), the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair: max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

2. **Constraints and Observations**:
   - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.
   - The minimum possible value of f(P) is the sum of the smallest N-1 numbers, i.e., 2 + 3 + ... + N.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P) for the given N.
   - If K is greater than this maximum, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.
   - If K is less than the minimum possible value, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.
   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - Start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible f(P).
   - Adjust the permutation to decrease the sum to K by swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(N, K):
    max_possible = sum of largest N-1 numbers
    min_possible = sum of smallest N-1 numbers
    
    if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:
        return -1
    
    permutation = list of numbers from N to 1 (descending order)
    current_sum = max_possible
    
    for i from 0 to N-2:
        if current_sum == K:
            break
        for j from N-1 down to i+1:
            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                swap permutation[i] and permutation[j]
                break
    
    return permutation
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_permutation(N, K):
    # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)
    max_possible = sum(range(2, N + 1))
    # Calculate the minimum possible value of f(P)
    min_possible = sum(range(1, N))
    
    if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:
        return -1
    
    # Start with the permutation in descending order
    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
    current_sum = max_possible
    
    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
    for i in range(N - 1):
        if current_sum == K:
            break
        for j in range(N - 1, i, -1):
            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]
                break
    
    return permutation

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        result = find_permutation(N, K)
        if result == -1:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution efficiently calculates the permutation for each test case by starting with the maximum possible sum and adjusting it to match the desired K.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

1. **Understanding the Range of f(P)**:
   - The problem involves calculating the sum of maximums of consecutive pairs in a permutation. The maximum possible value of this sum is achieved by arranging the numbers in descending order, while the minimum is achieved by arranging them in ascending order.
   - The official solution efficiently checks if the desired sum `K` is within the achievable range for a given `N`. This is crucial because it allows us to quickly determine if a solution is possible without unnecessary computation.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The official solution handles edge cases such as when `N` is 1 or when `K` is exactly the minimum possible value. These cases are directly checked and handled, which is a good practice to ensure robustness.

3. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - The official solution constructs the permutation by starting with the minimum possible sum and incrementally adjusting it to reach `K`. This is done by strategically placing larger numbers in positions that increase the sum.
   - The use of a loop to adjust the permutation until the desired sum is reached is a practical approach to ensure the solution is both correct and efficient.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The solution is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it avoids unnecessary permutations and directly constructs the required permutation if possible. This is important given the constraints where `N` can be as large as 100,000.

In summary, the official solution provides a clear and efficient method to solve the problem by leveraging the properties of permutations and the sum of maximums. It highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and efficiently constructing solutions within those constraints.
