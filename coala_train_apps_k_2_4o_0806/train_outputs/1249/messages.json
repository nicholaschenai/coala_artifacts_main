The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.\n\n    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes\n    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves:\n    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.\n    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.\n    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):\n        max_sum = 0\n        current_sum = 0\n        n = len(strengths)\n    \n        i = 0\n        while i < n:\n            # Start a new subsequence with the current element\n            current_sum = strengths[i]\n            i += 1\n        \n            # Alternate between adding and subtracting\n            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:\n                current_sum += strengths[i]\n                i += 1\n        \n            # Update the maximum sum found\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n    \n        return max_sum\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0\n            index += 2\n        \n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n        \n            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        This is the easy version of the problem.

Pok\u00e9mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok\u00e9mon army to resist.\n\n        First, Andrew counted all the pok\u00e9mon\u00a0\u2014 there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok\u00e9mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.\n\n        As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \\le b_1 < b_2 < \\dots < b_k \\le n$, and his army will consist of pok\u00e9mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \\dots, a_{b_k}$.\n\n        The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\dots$.\n\n        Andrew is experimenting with pok\u00e9mon order. He performs $q$ operations.

We want to form an army by selecting a subsequence of these Pok\u00e9mon such that the alternating sum of their strengths is maximized. The alternating sum is calculated as follows: the first element is added, the second is subtracted, the third is added, and so on. We need to determine the maximum possible alternating sum for the given sequence of Pok\u00e9mon strengths.\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Alternating Sum**: The alternating sum of a sequence is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. For example, for a sequence `[a, b, c, d]`, the alternating sum is `a - b + c - d`.\n\n        2. **Maximizing Alternating Sum**: To maximize the alternating sum, we should try to include the largest possible values at the positions where they are added and the smallest possible values at the positions where they are subtracted.\n\n        3. **Strategy**:\n           - Traverse the list of strengths.\n           - Maintain two variables: `max_odd` and `max_even` to keep track of the maximum alternating sum ending at an odd and even index respectively.\n           - For each strength, decide whether to add it to the current alternating sum or start a new subsequence.\n           - Update `max_odd` and `max_even` accordingly.\n\n        4. **Iterate through the list**:\n           - If the index is odd, update `max_odd` by considering the current strength added to `max_even`.\n           - If the index is even, update `max_even` by considering the current strength subtracted from `max_odd`.\n\n        5. **Result**: The maximum of `max_odd` and `max_even` at the end of the iteration will be the answer.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function max_alternating_sum(strengths):\n            max_odd = 0\n            max_even = 0\n    \n            for i from 0 to length of strengths - 1:\n                if i is even:\n                    max_even = max(max_even, max_odd + strengths[i])\n                else:\n                    max_odd = max(max_odd, max_even - strengths[i])\n    \n            return max(max_odd, max_even)\n\n        function main():\n            read number of test cases t\n            for each test case:\n                read n and q (q is always 0 in this problem)\n                read the list of strengths\n                print max_alternating_sum(strengths)\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def max_alternating_sum(strengths):\n            max_odd = 0\n            max_even = 0\n    \n            for i in range(len(strengths)):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    max_even = max(max_even, max_odd + strengths[i])\n                else:\n                    max_odd = max(max_odd, max_even - strengths[i])\n    \n            return max(max_odd, max_even)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            t = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(data[index])\n                q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0\n                index += 2\n        \n                strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n                index += n\n        \n                result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)\n                results.append(result)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently calculates the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sums for odd and even indices.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: 3\n        3 0\n        1 3 2\n        2 0\n        1 2\n        7 0\n        1 2 5 4 3 6 7\n         Expected output: [{'3'}, {'2'}, {'9'}] # Execution output: ['2', '1', '8']\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Failure\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: \n   - For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN), the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair: max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).\n\n2. **Constraints and Observations**:\n   - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.\n   - The minimum possible value of f(P) is the sum of the smallest N-1 numbers, i.e., 2 + 3 + ... + N.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P) for the given N.\n   - If K is greater than this maximum, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.\n   - If K is less than the minimum possible value, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.\n   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.\n\n4. **Constructing the Permutation**:\n   - Start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible f(P).\n   - Adjust the permutation to decrease the sum to K by swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_permutation(N, K):\n    max_possible = sum of largest N-1 numbers\n    min_possible = sum of smallest N-1 numbers\n    \n    if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:\n        return -1\n    \n    permutation = list of numbers from N to 1 (descending order)\n    current_sum = max_possible\n    \n    for i from 0 to N-2:\n        if current_sum == K:\n            break\n        for j from N-1 down to i+1:\n            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:\n                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])\n                swap permutation[i] and permutation[j]\n                break\n    \n    return permutation\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_permutation(N, K):\n    # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)\n    max_possible = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n    # Calculate the minimum possible value of f(P)\n    min_possible = sum(range(1, N))\n    \n    if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Start with the permutation in descending order\n    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n    current_sum = max_possible\n    \n    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K\n    for i in range(N - 1):\n        if current_sum == K:\n            break\n        for j in range(N - 1, i, -1):\n            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:\n                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])\n                permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]\n                break\n    \n    return permutation\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        result = find_permutation(N, K)\n        if result == -1:\n            results.append(\"-1\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the permutation for each test case by starting with the maximum possible sum and adjusting it to match the desired K."

The core concept here was understanding the function f(P) and how to manipulate permutations to achieve a specific sum.\n\nThe key strategy was to start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum of maximums, and then adjust it to decrease the sum to the desired K. This involved swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum while ensuring the sum does not drop below K.\n\nOne important realization was calculating the maximum and minimum possible values of f(P) for a given N. If K was outside this range, it was impossible to achieve, and the output should be -1. This check helped quickly eliminate impossible cases.\n\nThe solution involved iterating over the permutation and making swaps to adjust the sum. This approach was efficient and worked well within the constraints, as evidenced by the successful test results. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation properties and how to manipulate them to achieve specific outcomes."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:\n\n1. **Understanding the Range of f(P)**:\n   - The problem involves calculating the sum of maximums of consecutive pairs in a permutation. The maximum possible value of this sum is achieved by arranging the numbers in descending order, while the minimum is achieved by arranging them in ascending order.\n   - The official solution efficiently checks if the desired sum `K` is within the achievable range for a given `N`. This is crucial because it allows us to quickly determine if a solution is possible without unnecessary computation.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**:\n   - The official solution handles edge cases such as when `N` is 1 or when `K` is exactly the minimum possible value. These cases are directly checked and handled, which is a good practice to ensure robustness.\n\n3. **Constructing the Permutation**:\n   - The official solution constructs the permutation by starting with the minimum possible sum and incrementally adjusting it to reach `K`. This is done by strategically placing larger numbers in positions that increase the sum.\n   - The use of a loop to adjust the permutation until the desired sum is reached is a practical approach to ensure the solution is both correct and efficient.\n\n4. **Efficiency**:\n   - The solution is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it avoids unnecessary permutations and directly constructs the required permutation if possible. This is important given the constraints where `N` can be as large as 100,000.\n\nIn summary, the official solution provides a clear and efficient method to solve the problem by leveraging the properties of permutations and the sum of maximums. It highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and efficiently constructing solutions within those constraints."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers, N and K. It then calls another function to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific sum condition is met, or returns -1 if it's not possible. The results for each test case are collected in a list, and finally, the function writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to find a specific permutation of a sequence that satisfies a given condition based on a function of the permutation. It is particularly applicable in combinatorial optimization problems where the goal is to achieve a specific sum of maximum values from adjacent pairs in a permutation. This can be useful in algorithm design, competitive programming, and situations where constraints on permutations need to be met, such as scheduling or resource allocation problems."
