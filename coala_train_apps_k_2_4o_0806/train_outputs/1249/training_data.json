    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. The core concept here was understanding the function f(P) and how to manipulate permutations to achieve a specific sum.\n\nThe key strategy was to start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum of maximums, and then adjust it to decrease the sum to the desired K. This involved swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum while ensuring the sum does not drop below K.\n\nOne important realization was calculating the maximum and minimum possible values of f(P) for a given N. If K was outside this range, it was impossible to achieve, and the output should be -1. This check helped quickly eliminate impossible cases.\n\nThe solution involved iterating over the permutation and making swaps to adjust the sum. This approach was efficient and worked well within the constraints, as evidenced by the successful test results. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation properties and how to manipulate them to achieve specific outcomes.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:\n\n1. **Understanding the Range of f(P)**:\n   - The problem involves calculating the sum of maximums of consecutive pairs in a permutation. The maximum possible value of this sum is achieved by arranging the numbers in descending order, while the minimum is achieved by arranging them in ascending order.\n   - The official solution efficiently checks if the desired sum `K` is within the achievable range for a given `N`. This is crucial because it allows us to quickly determine if a solution is possible without unnecessary computation.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**:\n   - The official solution handles edge cases such as when `N` is 1 or when `K` is exactly the minimum possible value. These cases are directly checked and handled, which is a good practice to ensure robustness.\n\n3. **Constructing the Permutation**:\n   - The official solution constructs the permutation by starting with the minimum possible sum and incrementally adjusting it to reach `K`. This is done by strategically placing larger numbers in positions that increase the sum.\n   - The use of a loop to adjust the permutation until the desired sum is reached is a practical approach to ensure the solution is both correct and efficient.\n\n4. **Efficiency**:\n   - The solution is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it avoids unnecessary permutations and directly constructs the required permutation if possible. This is important given the constraints where `N` can be as large as 100,000.\n\nIn summary, the official solution provides a clear and efficient method to solve the problem by leveraging the properties of permutations and the sum of maximums. It highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and efficiently constructing solutions within those constraints.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers, N and K. It then calls another function to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific sum condition is met, or returns -1 if it's not possible. The results for each test case are collected in a list, and finally, the function writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to find a specific permutation of a sequence that satisfies a given condition based on a function of the permutation. It is particularly applicable in combinatorial optimization problems where the goal is to achieve a specific sum of maximum values from adjacent pairs in a permutation. This can be useful in algorithm design, competitive programming, and situations where constraints on permutations need to be met, such as scheduling or resource allocation problems."
