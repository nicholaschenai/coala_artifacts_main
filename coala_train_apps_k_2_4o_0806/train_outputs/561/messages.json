There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 102\n- 1 \u2264 K,Ai \u2264 109\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2 \n4 9\n5 2 2 4\n4 9\n5 2 18 3\n\nOutput:\nYES\nNO\n\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion.

If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

For each test case, we are given:\n- `N`: the number of minions.\n- `K`: the total amount of money Gru has.\n- A list of `N` integers, each representing the amount of money a minion demands.\n\nThe task is to determine if Gru can distribute all his money (`K`) among the minions such that he has no money left. Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount is less than or equal to the money he has left at that point.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. For each test case, we need to check if there is a combination of the minions' demands that sums exactly to `K`.\n2. This is a classic subset sum problem where we need to determine if a subset of the given demands can sum up to `K`.\n3. We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently:\n   - Use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a sum of `j` can be achieved with the given demands.\n   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `True` because a sum of zero can always be achieved with an empty subset.\n   - For each demand, update the `dp` array from back to front to avoid using the same demand multiple times.\n   - After processing all demands, check if `dp[K]` is `True`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction canSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, demands = test_case\n        dp = array of size (K+1) initialized to False\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        for each demand in demands:\n            for j from K down to demand:\n                if dp[j - demand] is True:\n                    dp[j] = True\n        \n        if dp[K] is True:\n            print \"YES\"\n        else:\n            print \"NO\"\n```\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef canSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, demands = test_case\n        # Initialize a dp array of size K+1 with False\n        dp = [False] * (K + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # Base case: sum of 0 is always possible\n        \n        # Process each demand\n        for demand in demands:\n            # Update dp array from back to front\n            for j in range(K, demand - 1, -1):\n                if dp[j - demand]:\n                    dp[j] = True\n        \n        # Check if we can achieve the sum K\n        if dp[K]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    K = int(data[index + 1])\n    demands = list(map(int, data[index + 2:index + 2 + N]))\n    test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n    index += 2 + N\n\n# Call the function\ncanSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case using a dynamic programming approach to solve the subset sum problem, and prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on whether Gru can spend all his money."

The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.\n\n    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.\n\n    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.\n\n    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n        \n            sum_A = sum(A)\n            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                k = sum_A // sum_indices\n                possible = True\n                for i in range(N):\n                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                if possible:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This involves creating a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a subset with sum `j` can be formed using the demands.\n\n### Revised Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction can_spend_all_money(test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N, K\n        read demands (list of N integers)\n        \n        initialize dp array of size K+1 with False\n        set dp[0] to True (base case: sum of 0 is always possible)\n        \n        for each demand in demands:\n            for j from K down to demand:\n                if dp[j - demand] is True:\n                    set dp[j] to True\n        \n        if dp[K] is True:\n            print \"YES\"\n        else:\n            print \"NO\"\n```\n\n### Revised Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef can_spend_all_money():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        \n        # Initialize dp array\n        dp = [False] * (K + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # Base case: sum of 0 is always possible\n        \n        # Process each demand\n        for demand in demands:\n            for j in range(K, demand - 1, -1):\n                if dp[j - demand]:\n                    dp[j] = True\n        \n        # Check if we can form the sum K\n        if dp[K]:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Call the function to execute the solution\ncan_spend_all_money()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Revised Code\n\n- **Dynamic Programming Array**: We use a `dp` array to track which sums can be formed using the demands.\n- **Iterate Over Demands**: For each demand, we update the `dp` array to reflect the new possible sums.\n- **Check for Exact Sum**: After processing all demands, we check if `dp[K]` is `True`, indicating that a subset of demands sums to `K`. If so, we output \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\"."

The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.\n\n    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.\n\n    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.\n\n    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n        \n            sum_A = sum(A)\n            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                k = sum_A // sum_indices\n                possible = True\n                for i in range(N):\n                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                if possible:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.\n        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

This is a classic subset sum problem, which is a common dynamic programming challenge.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: My final solution used a dynamic programming approach, which is efficient for this type of problem.

This method is straightforward but can be less efficient for larger inputs due to its recursive nature and potential for exponential time complexity. The dynamic programming approach I used is generally more efficient for larger constraints, as it avoids recalculating results for the same subproblems.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: The recursive approach in the official solution is elegant and concise but may not handle large inputs efficiently due to its potential exponential growth in recursive calls. The dynamic programming approach, while more complex to implement, offers better performance for larger datasets by using iterative calculations and memoization.\n\nIn summary, this exercise reinforced the importance of correctly interpreting problem requirements and choosing the appropriate algorithmic approach based on input constraints.
