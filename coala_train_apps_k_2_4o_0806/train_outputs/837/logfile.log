INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a different value of "N". We need to output the sum for each test case on a new line.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   For each test case:
   - Identify all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to "N".
   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence: 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N.
   - The largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N can be found by calculating `N // 10 * 10`.
   - The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{Number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{First term} + \text{Last term})
     \]
   - The first term is 10, and the last term is the largest multiple of 10 â‰¤ N.
   - The number of terms is the largest multiple of 10 divided by 10.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read the number of test cases, T
   For each test case:
       Read the integer N
       Calculate the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N: max_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
       Calculate the number of terms: num_terms = max_multiple // 10
       Calculate the sum using the arithmetic sequence formula:
           sum = (num_terms / 2) * (10 + max_multiple)
       Print the sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    
    results = []
    
    # Process each test case
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        # Read the integer N for the current test case
        N = int(data[i])
        
        # Calculate the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N
        max_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
        
        # Calculate the number of terms in the sequence
        num_terms = max_multiple // 10
        
        # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence
        # First term is 10, last term is max_multiple
        sum_multiples = (num_terms * (10 + max_multiple)) // 2
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(sum_multiples)
    
    # Output all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads input from standard input, processes each test case to calculate the sum of multiples of 10 up to N, and prints the result for each test case. The arithmetic sequence formula is used to efficiently compute the sum.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
      \[
      S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
      \]
      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

    ### Strategy:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_nth_term(N):
        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_nth_term(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to find the N'th number in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... Given a number of test cases, each with a single integer N, we need to output the N'th number in this series.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
           - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
           - Observing the differences between consecutive terms: 
             - 1 - 0 = 1
             - 5 - 1 = 4
             - 14 - 5 = 9
             - 30 - 14 = 16
             - 55 - 30 = 25
           - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, \ldots\).

        2. **Formulate the Series**:
           - The N'th term in the series can be calculated as the sum of squares from 1 to \(N-1\).
           - Formula: \( S(N) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i^2 \)

        3. **Efficient Calculation**:
           - Use the formula for the sum of squares: 
             \[
             S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
             \]
           - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term directly without iterating through all previous terms.

        ### Pseudocode

        1. Read the number of test cases, \( T \).
        2. For each test case:
           - Read the integer \( N \).
           - Calculate the N'th term using the formula:
             \[
             \text{term} = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
             \]
           - Output the calculated term.

        ### Python Code

        ```python
        def calculate_nth_term(N):
            # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **Function `calculate_nth_term(N)`**: Computes the N'th term in the series using the formula for the sum of squares.
        - **`main()` Function**: 
          - Reads input data.
          - Iterates over each test case, computes the result using `calculate_nth_term`, and stores it.
          - Outputs all results at the end. 
        - The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the result is an integer, as expected for the series terms.

- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number \( N \) for multiple test cases. The core concept here was recognizing the arithmetic series pattern in the multiples of 10 and efficiently calculating their sum using a formula.

The key steps involved:
1. Identifying the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to \( N \) by using integer division and multiplication.
2. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the sum of these multiples. The formula used was \( \text{sum} = 10 \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \), where \( k \) is the number of terms in the series.

This approach was efficient and handled the upper constraint of \( N \) being as large as 1 billion without performance issues. The solution was implemented in a way that reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the result for each.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sequences and leveraging mathematical formulas for efficient computation. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:

    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for t in range(eval(input())):
 n=eval(input())
 n-=n%10
 n/=10
 print(n*(n+1)/2*10)

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of summing multiples of 10 up to a given number \( N \). However, there are some differences in implementation that are worth noting:

1. **Efficiency and Simplicity:**
   - The official solution is more concise. It directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to \( N \) by using `n -= n % 10`, which is a straightforward way to adjust \( N \) to the nearest lower multiple of 10.
   - It then divides by 10 and uses the arithmetic series formula in a single line to compute the sum, which is efficient and easy to read.

2. **Use of Integer Division:**
   - My solution uses integer division (`//`) to ensure that the operations remain within integer arithmetic, which is important for large numbers to avoid floating-point precision issues.
   - The official solution uses regular division (`/`), which in Python 3 results in a float. This is acceptable here because the arithmetic operations are simple and Python handles large integers well, but using integer division is generally safer for integer-only operations.

3. **Code Readability:**
   - My solution separates the logic into a function and uses comments to explain each step, which can be helpful for understanding and maintaining the code.
   - The official solution is more compact and may be preferred in competitive programming settings where brevity is valued.

Overall, both solutions are correct and efficient, but the official solution demonstrates a more concise approach that leverages Python's handling of arithmetic operations effectively. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding both concise and verbose coding styles, as well as the implications of using different types of division in Python.
