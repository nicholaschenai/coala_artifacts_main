    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number \\( N \\). We will do this for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a different value of \\( N \\).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   For each test case:\n   - Determine the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to \\( N \\). This can be found by dividing \\( N \\) by 10 and multiplying the result by 10.\n   - Calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 from 10 up to this largest multiple.\n   - The sum of multiples of 10 up to a number \\( M \\) can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The series is \\( 10, 20, 30, \\ldots, M \\).\n   - Output the sum for each test case.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Read the number of test cases, T\n   For each test case:\n       Read the integer N\n       Find the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, call it M\n       Calculate the number of terms in the series: k = M / 10\n       Calculate the sum of the series: sum = 10 * (k * (k + 1)) / 2\n       Output the sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n    # Find the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N\n    M = (N // 10) * 10\n    \n    # Calculate the number of terms in the series\n    k = M // 10\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the series using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series\n    total_sum = 10 * (k * (k + 1)) // 2\n    \n    return total_sum\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    \n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        # Read each N\n        N = int(data[i])\n        \n        # Calculate the sum of multiples of 10 up to N\n        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n        \n        # Store the result\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Output all results, each on a new line\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code reads multiple test cases, calculates the sum of multiples of 10 up to each given \\( N \\), and outputs the result for each test case. The calculation uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to ensure efficiency, even for large values of \\( N \\).",
