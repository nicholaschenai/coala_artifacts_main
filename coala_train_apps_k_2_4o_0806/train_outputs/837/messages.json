This is acceptable here because the arithmetic operations are simple and Python handles large integers well, but using integer division is generally safer for integer-only operations.\n\n3. **Code Readability:**\n   - My solution separates the logic into a function and uses comments to explain each step, which can be helpful for understanding and maintaining the code.\n   - The official solution is more compact and may be preferred in competitive programming settings where brevity is valued.\n\nOverall, both solutions are correct and efficient, but the official solution demonstrates a more concise approach that leverages Python's handling of arithmetic operations effectively.
