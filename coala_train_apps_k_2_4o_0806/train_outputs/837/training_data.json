    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number \\( N \\) for multiple test cases. The core concept here was recognizing the arithmetic series pattern in the multiples of 10 and efficiently calculating their sum using a formula.\n\nThe key steps involved:\n1. Identifying the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to \\( N \\) by using integer division and multiplication.\n2. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the sum of these multiples. The formula used was \\( \\text{sum} = 10 \\times \\frac{k \\times (k + 1)}{2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the number of terms in the series.\n\nThis approach was efficient and handled the upper constraint of \\( N \\) being as large as 1 billion without performance issues. The solution was implemented in a way that reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the result for each.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sequences and leveraging mathematical formulas for efficient computation. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of summing multiples of 10 up to a given number \\( N \\). However, there are some differences in implementation that are worth noting:\n\n1. **Efficiency and Simplicity:**\n   - The official solution is more concise. It directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to \\( N \\) by using `n -= n % 10`, which is a straightforward way to adjust \\( N \\) to the nearest lower multiple of 10.\n   - It then divides by 10 and uses the arithmetic series formula in a single line to compute the sum, which is efficient and easy to read.\n\n2. **Use of Integer Division:**\n   - My solution uses integer division (`//`) to ensure that the operations remain within integer arithmetic, which is important for large numbers to avoid floating-point precision issues.\n   - The official solution uses regular division (`/`), which in Python 3 results in a float. This is acceptable here because the arithmetic operations are simple and Python handles large integers well, but using integer division is generally safer for integer-only operations.\n\n3. **Code Readability:**\n   - My solution separates the logic into a function and uses comments to explain each step, which can be helpful for understanding and maintaining the code.\n   - The official solution is more compact and may be preferred in competitive programming settings where brevity is valued.\n\nOverall, both solutions are correct and efficient, but the official solution demonstrates a more concise approach that leverages Python's handling of arithmetic operations effectively. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding both concise and verbose coding styles, as well as the implications of using different types of division in Python.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes a number of test cases followed by a list of integers. For each integer, it calculates the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to that integer. It stores the results for each test case and then prints each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to calculate the sum of multiples of a specific number up to a given limit, especially when dealing with large numbers where performance and avoiding integer overflow are concerns. This is common in competitive programming, data analysis, and mathematical computations where you need to efficiently sum sequences of numbers that follow a specific pattern. The solution uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is a common technique in mathematics to simplify and speed up calculations."
