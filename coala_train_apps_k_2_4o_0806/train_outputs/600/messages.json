For each test case, we are given an integer \\( N \\), which represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to consider. The task is to determine the last remaining number after performing the described process.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \\( F_0 = 0 \\), \\( F_1 = 1 \\), and \\( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Last Decimal Digit**: For each Fibonacci number, we are interested in its last decimal digit, which is the number modulo 10.\n\n3. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly remove all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last decimal digits until only one element remains.\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition**: The sequence of last decimal digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.\n\n5. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the periodicity, for any \\( N \\), we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers to determine the sequence of last digits. We can then simulate the reduction process on this sequence.\n\n6. **Reduction Process**: For a sequence of length \\( l \\), the new sequence \\( E \\) is formed by taking every second element starting from the second element. This process is repeated until the sequence has only one element.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Precompute the last decimal digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Determine the effective length \\( N \\% 60 \\) to use the precomputed sequence.\n   - Simulate the reduction process on the sequence of last digits until one element remains.\n   - Output the last remaining element.\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(T, test_cases):\n    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers\n    last_digits = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, 60):\n        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)\n    \n    results = []\n    for N in test_cases:\n        # Find the effective length using the periodicity of 60\n        effective_length = N % 60\n        if effective_length == 0:\n            effective_length = 60\n        \n        # Start with the sequence of last digits up to the effective length\n        D = last_digits[:effective_length]\n        \n        # Reduce the sequence until one element remains\n        while len(D) > 1:\n            D = D[1::2]  # Take every second element starting from the second\n        \n        # The last remaining element\n        results.append(D[0])\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = number of test cases\n# test_cases = list of N values for each test case\n# results = last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(T, test_cases)\n# for result in results:\n#     print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, allowing us to reduce the problem size significantly and perform the reduction process quickly."

The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \\(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots\\).\n    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: \n      \\[\n      S(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2N-1)}{6}\n      \\]\n      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.\n    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_term(N):\n        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = calculate_nth_term(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts on the Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring no two consecutive days have the same dish, and the first and last days are different. The key pattern is recognizing that for `N` days, the number of valid schedules can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the choices of dishes on the first, middle, and last days.\n\n    #### Strategy and Formula\n    Initially, the formula used was incorrect for `N > 3`. The correct approach is:\n    - For `N = 2`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n    - For `N = 3`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n    - For `N > 3`, the result should be \\(4 \\times 3^{N-2} \\times 2\\).\n\n    This formula accounts for:\n    - 4 choices for the first day.\n    - \\(3^{N-2}\\) choices for the middle days, ensuring no consecutive days are the same.\n    - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it's different from the first day.\n\n    #### Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the formula for `N > 3`, where the last multiplier was incorrectly set. The correct multiplier should ensure the first and last days are different, which is achieved by multiplying by 2, not 3. The misunderstanding of the expected output for `N = 5` was corrected by applying the correct formula, which results in 240, not 216.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            if N == 2:\n                result = 12\n            else:\n                result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n            results.append(result)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        results = calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly understanding the constraints and requirements of the problem, especially when dealing with large values of `N`.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is achieved by determining the position of the highest set bit in the binary representation of N.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution is more efficient than my initial approach because it avoids the need to simulate the sequence reduction process.

The problem highlights the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, which is a common pattern in modular arithmetic. This can be applied in computational problems where direct computation is infeasible due to large input sizes, and an understanding of periodicity or cycles can significantly reduce computational complexity. Additionally, the problem involves a reduction process that is common in algorithm design, where sequences are iteratively reduced to a single element, which is a useful technique in various fields such as data compression, signal processing, and algorithm optimization."
