## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of Fibonacci numbers and need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of their last decimal digits. For each test case, we are given an integer \( N \), which represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to consider. The task is to determine the last remaining number after performing the described process.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

2. **Last Decimal Digit**: For each Fibonacci number, we are interested in its last decimal digit, which is the number modulo 10.

3. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly remove all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last decimal digits until only one element remains.

4. **Pattern Recognition**: The sequence of last decimal digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

5. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the periodicity, for any \( N \), we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers to determine the sequence of last digits. We can then simulate the reduction process on this sequence.

6. **Reduction Process**: For a sequence of length \( l \), the new sequence \( E \) is formed by taking every second element starting from the second element. This process is repeated until the sequence has only one element.

## Pseudocode

1. Precompute the last decimal digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. For each test case:
   - Determine the effective length \( N \% 60 \) to use the precomputed sequence.
   - Simulate the reduction process on the sequence of last digits until one element remains.
   - Output the last remaining element.

## Python Solution

```python
def last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(T, test_cases):
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    
    results = []
    for N in test_cases:
        # Find the effective length using the periodicity of 60
        effective_length = N % 60
        if effective_length == 0:
            effective_length = 60
        
        # Start with the sequence of last digits up to the effective length
        D = last_digits[:effective_length]
        
        # Reduce the sequence until one element remains
        while len(D) > 1:
            D = D[1::2]  # Take every second element starting from the second
        
        # The last remaining element
        results.append(D[0])
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# T = number of test cases
# test_cases = list of N values for each test case
# results = last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(T, test_cases)
# for result in results:
#     print(result)
```

This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, allowing us to reduce the problem size significantly and perform the reduction process quickly.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
      \[
      S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
      \]
      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

    ### Strategy:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_nth_term(N):
        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_nth_term(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts on the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring no two consecutive days have the same dish, and the first and last days are different. The key pattern is recognizing that for `N` days, the number of valid schedules can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the choices of dishes on the first, middle, and last days.

    #### Strategy and Formula
    Initially, the formula used was incorrect for `N > 3`. The correct approach is:
    - For `N = 2`, the result is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).
    - For `N = 3`, the result is \(4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24\).
    - For `N > 3`, the result should be \(4 \times 3^{N-2} \times 2\).

    This formula accounts for:
    - 4 choices for the first day.
    - \(3^{N-2}\) choices for the middle days, ensuring no consecutive days are the same.
    - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it's different from the first day.

    #### Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the formula for `N > 3`, where the last multiplier was incorrectly set. The correct multiplier should ensure the first and last days are different, which is achieved by multiplying by 2, not 3. The misunderstanding of the expected output for `N = 5` was corrected by applying the correct formula, which results in 240, not 216.

    #### Final Code Snippet
    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            if N == 2:
                result = 12
            else:
                result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD
            results.append(result)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly understanding the constraints and requirements of the problem, especially when dealing with large values of `N`.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements from a sequence derived from the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. For each test case, we are given an integer N, and we need to determine the last number left after this process.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Fibonacci sequence has a periodic pattern in its last digits when taken modulo 10. This pattern repeats every 60 numbers. Therefore, for any N, we can determine the sequence of last digits by considering only the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. Once we have this sequence, we can simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains. This process is efficient because we only need to consider a maximum of 60 numbers, regardless of how large N is.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10.
   For each test case:
       Calculate the effective length of the sequence as N % 60.
       If the effective length is 0, set it to 60.
       Initialize the sequence D with the first 'effective length' elements of the precomputed sequence.
       While the length of D is greater than 1:
           Create a new sequence E by taking every second element from D (even indices).
           Set D to E.
       Output the single remaining element in D.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements from a sequence derived from the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. For each test case, we are given an integer N, and we need to determine the last number left after this process.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Fibonacci sequence has a periodic pattern in its last digits when taken modulo 10. This pattern repeats every 60 numbers. Therefore, for any N, we can determine the sequence of last digits by considering only the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. Once we have this sequence, we can simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains. This process is efficient because we only need to consider a maximum of 60 numbers, regardless of how large N is.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10.
   For each test case:
       Calculate the effective length of the sequence as N % 60.
       If the effective length is 0, set it to 60.
       Initialize the sequence D with the first 'effective length' elements of the precomputed sequence.
       While the length of D is greater than 1:
           Create a new sequence E by taking every second element from D (even indices).
           Set D to E.
       Output the single remaining element in D.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] In this problem, the key insight was recognizing the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity occurs every 60 numbers, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the problem. Instead of calculating potentially massive Fibonacci numbers, we only need to consider the first 60 numbers and their last digits.

The solution involves precomputing the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. For each test case, we determine the effective length of the sequence by taking `N % 60`. If the result is zero, it means the sequence should be the full 60 numbers. We then simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially given the large possible values of N (up to \(10^{18}\)). The use of slicing to reduce the sequence was a straightforward and effective method to simulate the required process. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns and periodicity in sequences to optimize solutions.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] The problem of finding the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements from a sequence derived from the last digits of Fibonacci numbers can be efficiently solved by leveraging the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. The official solution provides an insightful approach that is both time and space efficient.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10:**
   - The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers when taken modulo 10. This periodicity allows us to precompute the sequence of last digits for the first 60 Fibonacci numbers, which can then be reused for any N.

2. **Efficient Index Calculation:**
   - Instead of directly simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements, the official solution uses a mathematical approach to determine the effective index in the precomputed sequence. This is done by calculating the largest power of 2 less than or equal to N, which corresponds to the position in the sequence after all removals.

3. **Use of Bit Manipulation:**
   - The solution uses bit manipulation to efficiently find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to N. This is achieved by determining the position of the highest set bit in the binary representation of N.

### Reflection:

The official solution is more efficient than my initial approach because it avoids the need to simulate the sequence reduction process. Instead, it directly calculates the final position using mathematical properties of powers of 2 and the periodicity of the sequence. This reduces both time and space complexity, making it suitable for very large values of N. This approach is a great example of how understanding the mathematical properties of a problem can lead to a more elegant and efficient solution.

    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
    - $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (20 points):
    - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
    - $1 \le N \le 10^7$
    Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

    -----Example Input-----
    1
    9

    -----Example Output-----
    3

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.
