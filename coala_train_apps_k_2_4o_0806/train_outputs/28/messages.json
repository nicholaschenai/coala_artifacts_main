Today he came with the following problem.\n\nYou are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string \"abacaba\" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?\n\nEach question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string \"a?b?c\" can be transformed into strings \"aabbc\" and \"azbzc\", but can't be transformed into strings \"aabc\", \"a?bbc\" and \"babbc\".\n\nOccurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string \"ababa\" has two occurrences of a string \"aba\" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string \"aba\" in the string \"acba\" as a substring.\n\nPlease help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string \"abacaba\" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \\leq n \\leq 50$), length of a string $s$.\n\nThe second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case output an answer for it.\n\nIn case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string \"abacaba\" in the resulting string as a substring output \"No\".\n\nOtherwise output \"Yes\" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.\n\nYou may print every letter in \"Yes\" and \"No\" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n7\nabacaba\n7\n???????\n11\naba?abacaba\n11\nabacaba?aba\n15\nasdf???f???qwer\n11\nabacabacaba\n\nOutput\nYes\nabacaba\nYes\nabacaba\nYes\nabadabacaba\nYes\nabacabadaba\nNo\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string \"abacaba\" in the string \"abacaba\" as a substring.\n\nIn second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with \"abacaba\" in particular.\n\nIn sixth example there are two occurrences of a string \"abacaba\" as a substring.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Our task is to determine if it's possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string \"abacaba\" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If it's possible, we should output \"Yes\" and provide one such resulting string. If not, we should output \"No\".\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s` where \"abacaba\" could potentially start (i.e., from index 0 to `n-7`), check if it's possible to form \"abacaba\" by replacing question marks or matching existing characters.\n\n2. **Check for Unique Occurrence**: After forming \"abacaba\" at a potential position, ensure that this is the only occurrence of \"abacaba\" in the entire string.\n\n3. **Replace Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all remaining question marks in the string with any arbitrary letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the transformation.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: If a valid transformation is found, output \"Yes\" and the transformed string. Otherwise, output \"No\".\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction can_form_abacaba(s, n):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    target_length = 7\n\n    for start in range(n - target_length + 1):\n        # Check if we can form \"abacaba\" starting at index `start`\n        can_form = True\n        for i in range(target_length):\n            if s[start + i] != '?' and s[start + i] != target[i]:\n                can_form = False\n                break\n        \n        if can_form:\n            # Create a new string with \"abacaba\" at the current position\n            new_s = list(s)\n            for i in range(target_length):\n                new_s[start + i] = target[i]\n            \n            # Check if \"abacaba\" occurs exactly once\n            count = 0\n            for i in range(n - target_length + 1):\n                if new_s[i:i + target_length] == list(target):\n                    count += 1\n            \n            if count == 1:\n                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if new_s[i] == '?':\n                        new_s[i] = 'z'\n                return \"Yes\", \"\".join(new_s)\n    \n    return \"No\", None\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read n\n        read s\n        result, transformed_string = can_form_abacaba(s, n)\n        if result == \"Yes\":\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            print(transformed_string)\n        else:\n            print(\"No\")\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef can_form_abacaba(s, n):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    target_length = 7\n\n    for start in range(n - target_length + 1):\n        # Check if we can form \"abacaba\" starting at index `start`\n        can_form = True\n        for i in range(target_length):\n            if s[start + i] != '?' and s[start + i] != target[i]:\n                can_form = False\n                break\n        \n        if can_form:\n            # Create a new string with \"abacaba\" at the current position\n            new_s = list(s)\n            for i in range(target_length):\n                new_s[start + i] = target[i]\n            \n            # Check if \"abacaba\" occurs exactly once\n            count = 0\n            for i in range(n - target_length + 1):\n                if new_s[i:i + target_length] == list(target):\n                    count += 1\n            \n            if count == 1:\n                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if new_s[i] == '?':\n                        new_s[i] = 'z'\n                return \"Yes\", \"\".join(new_s)\n    \n    return \"No\", None\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        s = data[index + 1]\n        index += 2\n        \n        result, transformed_string = can_form_abacaba(s, n)\n        if result == \"Yes\":\n            results.append(\"Yes\")\n            results.append(transformed_string)\n        else:\n            results.append(\"No\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```"

If they do, we remove these three characters from the stack.\n        4. **Repeat Until Done**: Continue this process until we have processed all characters in the string.\n        5. **Resulting String**: The characters remaining in the stack form the resulting string after all \"abc\" substrings have been removed.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function remove_abc(string):\n            stack = empty list\n            for each character in string:\n                add character to stack\n                if last three characters in stack form \"abc\":\n                    remove last three characters from stack\n            return join characters in stack to form the resulting string\n\n        function process_test_cases(test_cases):\n            results = empty list\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                result = remove_abc(test_case)\n                add result to results\n            return results\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def remove_abc(s):\n            stack = []\n            for char in s:\n                stack.append(char)\n                # Check if the last three characters form \"abc\"\n                if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n                    # Remove the last three characters\n                    stack.pop()\n                    stack.pop()\n                    stack.pop()\n            # Join the stack to form the resulting string\n            return ''.join(stack)\n\n        def process_test_cases(test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                result = remove_abc(test_case)\n                results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().strip().split()\n\n        # First line is the number of test cases\n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = data[1:T+1]\n\n        # Process each test case\n        results = process_test_cases(test_cases)\n\n        # Output results\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code\n\n        - **remove_abc Function**: This function takes a string and uses a stack to remove all occurrences of the substring \"abc\".

This means checking every substring of length 7 in `s` to see if it can be transformed into \"abacaba\" by replacing question marks.\n\n2. **Check for Validity**: For each potential position, replace the question marks to form \"abacaba\" and check if this results in exactly one occurrence of \"abacaba\" in the entire string.\n\n3. **Replace Remaining Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all remaining question marks in the string with any character (e.g., 'z') to complete the transformation.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: If a valid transformation is found, output \"Yes\" and the resulting string. If no valid transformation is possible, output \"No\".\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction can_form_single_abacaba(s, n):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    for i from 0 to n - 7:\n        if can_place_abacaba(s, i):\n            temp_s = replace_to_form_abacaba(s, i)\n            if count_abacaba(temp_s) == 1:\n                return \"Yes\", fill_remaining_question_marks(temp_s)\n    return \"No\"\n\nfunction can_place_abacaba(s, start):\n    for j from 0 to 6:\n        if s[start + j] != '?' and s[start + j] != target[j]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nfunction replace_to_form_abacaba(s, start):\n    s_list = list(s)\n    for j from 0 to 6:\n        if s_list[start + j] == '?':\n            s_list[start + j] = target[j]\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\nfunction count_abacaba(s):\n    count = 0\n    for i from 0 to len(s) - 7:\n        if s[i:i+7] == \"abacaba\":\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nfunction fill_remaining_question_marks(s):\n    return s.replace('?', 'z')\n\nfunction process_test_cases(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        n, s = test_case\n        result = can_form_single_abacaba(s, n)\n        results.append(result)\n    return results\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef can_place_abacaba(s, start):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    for j in range(7):\n        if s[start + j] != '?' and s[start + j] != target[j]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef replace_to_form_abacaba(s, start):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    s_list = list(s)\n    for j in range(7):\n        if s_list[start + j] == '?':\n            s_list[start + j] = target[j]\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\ndef count_abacaba(s):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n        if s[i:i+7] == \"abacaba\":\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef fill_remaining_question_marks(s):\n    return s.replace('?', 'z')\n\ndef can_form_single_abacaba(s, n):\n    for i in range(n - 6):\n        if can_place_abacaba(s, i):\n            temp_s = replace_to_form_abacaba(s, i)\n            if count_abacaba(temp_s) == 1:\n                return \"Yes\", fill_remaining_question_marks(temp_s)\n    return \"No\",\n\ndef process_test_cases(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        n, s = test_case\n        result = can_form_single_abacaba(s, n)\n        results.append(result)\n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().strip().split()\n\n# First line is the number of test cases\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(data[index])\n    s = data[index + 1]\n    test_cases.append((n, s))\n    index += 2\n\n# Process each test case\nresults = process_test_cases(T, test_cases)\n\n# Output results\nfor result in results:\n    if result[0] == \"Yes\":\n        print(result[0])\n        print(result[1])\n    else:\n        print(result[0])\n```"

The challenge was to ensure that \"abacaba\" appears exactly once after the transformation.\n\n### Core Concepts and Patterns:\n- **Substring Matching**: The problem required checking if a specific substring (\"abacaba\") could be formed at various positions in the string `s`.\n- **Handling Wildcards**: The presence of question marks meant that we had to consider them as potential matches for any character, which added complexity to the substring matching.\n- **Counting Occurrences**: After forming \"abacaba\" at a potential position, it was crucial to count its occurrences in the entire string to ensure it appeared exactly once.\n\n### Strategies:\n- **Iterative Checking**: For each possible starting position in `s`, check if \"abacaba\" can be formed by replacing question marks. This was done using a helper function `can_place_abacaba`.\n- **Replacement and Validation**: Once a potential position was found, replace the question marks to form \"abacaba\" and validate the entire string to ensure it appears only once.\n- **Final Transformation**: After confirming a valid transformation, replace any remaining question marks with a filler character (e.g., 'z') to complete the string.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n```python\ndef can_place_abacaba(s, start):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    for j in range(7):\n        if s[start + j] != '?' and s[start + j] != target[j]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef replace_to_form_abacaba(s, start):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    s_list = list(s)\n    for j in range(7):\n        if s_list[start + j] == '?':\n            s_list[start + j] = target[j]\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n\ndef count_abacaba(s):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n        if s[i:i+7] == \"abacaba\":\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef fill_remaining_question_marks(s):\n    return s.replace('?', 'z')\n\ndef can_form_single_abacaba(s, n):\n    for i in range(n - 6):\n        if can_place_abacaba(s, i):\n            temp_s = replace_to_form_abacaba(s, i)\n            if count_abacaba(temp_s) == 1:\n                return \"Yes\", fill_remaining_question_marks(temp_s)\n    return \"No\",\n```\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of careful substring manipulation and validation, especially when dealing with wildcards.

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the \"abacaba\" string transformation problem, I found the task to be a constructive problem that required careful handling of string manipulation and substring checking. Here are some key insights and takeaways from the experience:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem required transforming a string with question marks into a valid string containing exactly one occurrence of \"abacaba\". This involved both identifying potential positions for \"abacaba\" and ensuring no other occurrences exist after transformation.\n\n2. **Approach**: My approach involved iterating over possible starting positions for \"abacaba\", checking if it could be placed there by replacing question marks, and then verifying if this resulted in exactly one occurrence. This was a straightforward method that aligned well with the problem requirements.\n\n3. **Official Solution Insights**: The official solution follows a similar approach but is more concise in its implementation. It uses a helper function `check` to count occurrences of \"abacaba\" and employs a loop to attempt placing \"abacaba\" at each position, replacing question marks as needed. The solution also efficiently handles the case where no transformation is needed by directly replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.\n\n4. **Efficiency and Clarity**: Both my solution and the official solution are efficient given the constraints, but the official solution is slightly more elegant in its use of list slicing and direct string manipulation. It avoids unnecessary function calls and uses list copying to manage potential transformations.\n\n5. **Learning Points**: The problem reinforced the importance of breaking down string manipulation tasks into clear, manageable steps. It also highlighted the utility of helper functions for repetitive tasks like counting substrings. Additionally, the official solution's use of list slicing and direct manipulation is a useful technique for similar problems.\n\nOverall, the problem was a good exercise in string manipulation and constructive problem-solving, with both my approach and the official solution providing valid and efficient methods to achieve the desired outcome."

For each test case, it checks if it's possible to replace '?' characters in the string to form exactly one \"abacaba\" without altering any existing \"abacaba\" substrings.

This is common in problems involving pattern matching, string manipulation, and combinatorial search. It is particularly relevant in competitive programming and coding interviews where constraints on string formation and pattern occurrence are given. The solution involves checking possible placements of the pattern, replacing wildcards, and ensuring the pattern occurs exactly once, which is a common requirement in string processing tasks."
