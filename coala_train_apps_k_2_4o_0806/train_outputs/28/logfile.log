## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input

7
abacaba
7

11
aba?abacaba

11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` that consists of lowercase English letters and question marks. Our task is to determine if it's possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If it's possible, we should output "Yes" and provide one such resulting string. If not, we should output "No".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s` where "abacaba" could potentially start (i.e., from index 0 to `n-7`), check if it's possible to form "abacaba" by replacing question marks or matching existing characters.

2. **Check for Unique Occurrence**: After forming "abacaba" at a potential position, ensure that this is the only occurrence of "abacaba" in the entire string.

3. **Replace Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all remaining question marks in the string with any arbitrary letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the transformation.

4. **Output the Result**: If a valid transformation is found, output "Yes" and the transformed string. Otherwise, output "No".

### Pseudocode

```
function can_form_abacaba(s, n):
    target = "abacaba"
    target_length = 7

    for start in range(n - target_length + 1):
        # Check if we can form "abacaba" starting at index `start`
        can_form = True
        for i in range(target_length):
            if s[start + i] != '?' and s[start + i] != target[i]:
                can_form = False
                break
        
        if can_form:
            # Create a new string with "abacaba" at the current position
            new_s = list(s)
            for i in range(target_length):
                new_s[start + i] = target[i]
            
            # Check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once
            count = 0
            for i in range(n - target_length + 1):
                if new_s[i:i + target_length] == list(target):
                    count += 1
            
            if count == 1:
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                for i in range(n):
                    if new_s[i] == '?':
                        new_s[i] = 'z'
                return "Yes", "".join(new_s)
    
    return "No", None

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        result, transformed_string = can_form_abacaba(s, n)
        if result == "Yes":
            print("Yes")
            print(transformed_string)
        else:
            print("No")
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def can_form_abacaba(s, n):
    target = "abacaba"
    target_length = 7

    for start in range(n - target_length + 1):

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a string consisting of lowercase English alphabets. The task is to iteratively remove all occurrences of the substring "abc" from the string until no such substring remains. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to efficiently remove the "abc" substrings:

        1. **Iterate through the String**: For each character in the string, we will process it one by one.
        2. **Use a Stack**: We will use a stack to keep track of the characters that are not part of an "abc" substring.
        3. **Check for "abc"**: As we add each character to the stack, we check if the last three characters in the stack form the substring "abc". If they do, we remove these three characters from the stack.
        4. **Repeat Until Done**: Continue this process until we have processed all characters in the string.
        5. **Resulting String**: The characters remaining in the stack form the resulting string after all "abc" substrings have been removed.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function remove_abc(string):
            stack = empty list
            for each character in string:
                add character to stack
                if last three characters in stack form "abc":
                    remove last three characters from stack
            return join characters in stack to form the resulting string

        function process_test_cases(test_cases):
            results = empty list
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                result = remove_abc(test_case)
                add result to results
            return results
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def remove_abc(s):
            stack = []
            for char in s:
                stack.append(char)
                # Check if the last three characters form "abc"
                if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:
                    # Remove the last three characters
                    stack.pop()
                    stack.pop()
                    stack.pop()
            # Join the stack to form the resulting string
            return ''.join(stack)

        def process_test_cases(test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                result = remove_abc(test_case)
                results.append(result)
            return results

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().strip().split()

        # First line is the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = data[1:T+1]

        # Process each test case
        results = process_test_cases(test_cases)

        # Output results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **remove_abc Function**: This function takes a string and uses a stack to remove all occurrences of the substring "abc". It iterates through each character, adding it to the stack, and checks if the last three characters in the stack form "abc". If they do, it removes them.
        - **process_test_cases Function**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `remove_abc` for each test case and collecting the results.
        - **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

        - 1 ≤ T ≤ 50
        - 1 ≤ N ≤ 50
        - S will consist of uppercase English letters.

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        2
        4
        DCBA
        7
        XYZZYZZ

        Output:
        ADCB
        XYYZZZZ

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
        Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a string consisting of uppercase English letters. We are allowed to perform at most one operation where we can remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our task is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we need to consider the following:

        1. **Identify the smallest character**: We should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible.
        2. **Positioning**: If the smallest character is not already at the beginning, we should move it to the start. If it is already at the start, we should look for the next smallest character that can be moved to improve the order.
        3. **Iterate through the string**: For each character, check if moving it to the start or another position can result in a smaller string.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
            smallest_string = S
            for i from 0 to length of S - 1:
                for j from 0 to length of S - 1:
                    if i != j:
                        # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j
                        new_string = S with character at i removed and inserted at j
                        if new_string is lexicographically smaller than smallest_string:
                            smallest_string = new_string
            return smallest_string

        function process_test_cases(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, S = test_case
                result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)
                add result to results
            return results
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
            smallest_string = S
            N = len(S)
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(N):
                    if i != j:
                        # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j
                        new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]
                        new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]
                        if new_string < smallest_string:
                            smallest_string = new_string
            return smallest_string

            for test_case in test_cases:
                N, S = test_case
                result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)
                results.append(result)
            return results

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().strip().split()

        # First line is the number of test cases

            S = data[index + 1]
            test_cases.append((N, S))
            index += 2

        results = process_test_cases(T, test_cases)

        # Output results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **find_lexicographically_smallest_string Function**: This function iterates over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. It checks if the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the current smallest string found.
        - **process_test_cases Function**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` for each test case and collecting the results.
        - **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. We need to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If possible, we should output "Yes" and the resulting string; otherwise, output "No".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Potential Positions**: We need to find all possible positions in the string `s` where "abacaba" can be placed. This means checking every substring of length 7 in `s` to see if it can be transformed into "abacaba" by replacing question marks.

2. **Check for Validity**: For each potential position, replace the question marks to form "abacaba" and check if this results in exactly one occurrence of "abacaba" in the entire string.

3. **Replace Remaining Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all remaining question marks in the string with any character (e.g., 'z') to complete the transformation.

4. **Output the Result**: If a valid transformation is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. If no valid transformation is possible, output "No".

### Pseudocode

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. We need to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If possible, we should output "Yes" and the resulting string; otherwise, output "No".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Potential Positions**: We need to find all possible positions in the string `s` where "abacaba" can be placed. This means checking every substring of length 7 in `s` to see if it can be transformed into "abacaba" by replacing question marks.

2. **Check for Validity**: For each potential position, replace the question marks to form "abacaba" and check if this results in exactly one occurrence of "abacaba" in the entire string.

3. **Replace Remaining Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all remaining question marks in the string with any character (e.g., 'z') to complete the transformation.

4. **Output the Result**: If a valid transformation is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. If no valid transformation is possible, output "No".

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] In this problem, the main task was to determine if a string "abacaba" could be formed exactly once in a given string `s` by replacing question marks with lowercase English letters. The challenge was to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once after the transformation.

### Core Concepts and Patterns:
- **Substring Matching**: The problem required checking if a specific substring ("abacaba") could be formed at various positions in the string `s`.
- **Handling Wildcards**: The presence of question marks meant that we had to consider them as potential matches for any character, which added complexity to the substring matching.
- **Counting Occurrences**: After forming "abacaba" at a potential position, it was crucial to count its occurrences in the entire string to ensure it appeared exactly once.

### Strategies:
- **Iterative Checking**: For each possible starting position in `s`, check if "abacaba" can be formed by replacing question marks. This was done using a helper function `can_place_abacaba`.
- **Replacement and Validation**: Once a potential position was found, replace the question marks to form "abacaba" and validate the entire string to ensure it appears only once.
- **Final Transformation**: After confirming a valid transformation, replace any remaining question marks with a filler character (e.g., 'z') to complete the string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, start):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[start + j] != '?' and s[start + j] != target[j]:
            return False
    return True

def replace_to_form_abacaba(s, start):
    target = "abacaba"
    s_list = list(s)
    for j in range(7):
        if s_list[start + j] == '?':
            s_list[start + j] = target[j]
    return ''.join(s_list)

def count_abacaba(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 6):
        if s[i:i+7] == "abacaba":
            count += 1
    return count

def fill_remaining_question_marks(s):
    return s.replace('?', 'z')

def can_form_single_abacaba(s, n):
    for i in range(n - 6):
        if can_place_abacaba(s, i):
            temp_s = replace_to_form_abacaba(s, i)
            if count_abacaba(temp_s) == 1:
                return "Yes", fill_remaining_question_marks(temp_s)
    return "No",
```

This problem reinforced the importance of careful substring manipulation and validation, especially when dealing with wildcards. The solution was efficient due to the limited length of the string and the specific pattern we were searching for.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the "abacaba" string transformation problem, I found the task to be a constructive problem that required careful handling of string manipulation and substring checking. Here are some key insights and takeaways from the experience:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem required transforming a string with question marks into a valid string containing exactly one occurrence of "abacaba". This involved both identifying potential positions for "abacaba" and ensuring no other occurrences exist after transformation.

2. **Approach**: My approach involved iterating over possible starting positions for "abacaba", checking if it could be placed there by replacing question marks, and then verifying if this resulted in exactly one occurrence. This was a straightforward method that aligned well with the problem requirements.

3. **Official Solution Insights**: The official solution follows a similar approach but is more concise in its implementation. It uses a helper function `check` to count occurrences of "abacaba" and employs a loop to attempt placing "abacaba" at each position, replacing question marks as needed. The solution also efficiently handles the case where no transformation is needed by directly replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.

4. **Efficiency and Clarity**: Both my solution and the official solution are efficient given the constraints, but the official solution is slightly more elegant in its use of list slicing and direct string manipulation. It avoids unnecessary function calls and uses list copying to manage potential transformations.

5. **Learning Points**: The problem reinforced the importance of breaking down string manipulation tasks into clear, manageable steps. It also highlighted the utility of helper functions for repetitive tasks like counting substrings. Additionally, the official solution's use of list slicing and direct manipulation is a useful technique for similar problems.

Overall, the problem was a good exercise in string manipulation and constructive problem-solving, with both my approach and the official solution providing valid and efficient methods to achieve the desired outcome.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the main task was to determine if a string "abacaba" could be formed exactly once in a given string `s` by replacing question marks with lowercase English letters. The challenge was to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once after the transformation.

The main function is `process_test_cases`.
INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] The function processes multiple test cases to determine if a given string can be modified to contain exactly one occurrence of the substring "abacaba". For each test case, it checks if it's possible to replace '?' characters in the string to form exactly one "abacaba" without altering any existing "abacaba" substrings. If successful, it returns "Yes" along with the modified string where remaining '?' are replaced with 'z'; otherwise, it returns "No". The function iterates over each test case, applies the logic, and collects the results for output.

[Problem]
    Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

    You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

    Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

    Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

    Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


    -----Input-----

    First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

    The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

    The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case output an answer for it.

    In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

    Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

    You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


    -----Example-----
    Input
    6
    7
    abacaba
    7
    ???????
    11
    aba?abacaba
    11
    abacaba?aba
    15
    asdf???f???qwer
    11
    abacabacaba

    Output
    Yes
    abacaba
    Yes
    abacaba
    Yes
    abadabacaba
    Yes
    abacabadaba
    No
    No



    -----Note-----

    In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

    In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

    In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.
