INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. The goal is to return the final string after all possible removals have been made.

## Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We can use a stack to help us keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string.
   - For each character in the string, we check if it matches the character at the top of the stack.
   - If it matches, we increment the count of that character.
   - If the count reaches `k`, we remove that character from the stack.
   - If it doesn't match, we push the new character onto the stack with a count of 1.
   - After processing all characters, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.

## Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   For each character in the string:
       If the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack has the same character:
           Increment the count of the top element
           If the count equals k:
               Pop the top element from the stack
       Else:
           Push the character with count 1 onto the stack
   Initialize an empty result string
   For each element in the stack:
       Append the character repeated by its count to the result string
   Return the result string
   ```

## Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts
        stack = []
        
        # Iterate over each character in the string
        for char in s:
            # If the stack is not empty and the top element has the same character
            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                # Increment the count of the top element
                stack[-1][1] += 1
                # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack
                if stack[-1][1] == k:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                # Push the new character with count 1 onto the stack
                stack.append([char, 1])
        
        # Initialize an empty result string
        result = ''
        # Reconstruct the string from the stack
        for char, count in stack:
            result += char * count
        
        # Return the final result string
        return result
```

This solution efficiently processes the string in a single pass, using a stack to manage the characters and their counts, ensuring that we can handle the constraints of the problem effectively.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given an encoded string that follows a specific pattern: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a string that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Stack Utilization**: Use a stack to help manage nested patterns. The stack will store characters and numbers as we parse through the string.

        2. **Parsing the String**:
           - Traverse the string character by character.
           - If a digit is encountered, determine the full number (which could be more than one digit).
           - If an opening bracket `[` is encountered, push the current number and the current string onto the stack and reset them.
           - If a closing bracket `]` is encountered, pop from the stack to get the last string and the number of repetitions, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last string.
           - If a character is encountered, append it to the current string.

        3. **Final Output**: After processing the entire string, the stack should be empty, and the current string will be the fully decoded string.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function decodeString(s):
            stack = []
            current_string = ""
            current_number = 0

            for each character in s:
                if character is a digit:
                    update current_number
                else if character is '[':
                    push (current_string, current_number) onto stack
                    reset current_string and current_number
                else if character is ']':
                    pop (last_string, repeat_count) from stack
                    current_string = last_string + (current_string repeated repeat_count times)
                else:
                    append character to current_string

            return current_string
        ```

        ### Final Python Code

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
                stack = []
                current_string = ""
                current_number = 0
        
                for char in s:
                    if char.isdigit():
                        current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
                    elif char == '[':
                        stack.append((current_string, current_number))
                        current_string = ""
                        current_number = 0
                    elif char == ']':
                        last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()
                        current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count
                    else:
                        current_string += char
        
                return current_string
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **Stack**: Used to keep track of the strings and numbers before encountering a `[` and to manage nested patterns.
        - **current_string**: Holds the current segment of the string being processed.
        - **current_number**: Accumulates digits to form the full number before a `[` is encountered.
        - **Loop**: Iterates over each character in the string, updating `current_string` and `current_number` as needed, and using the stack to handle nested patterns.
        - **Return**: The fully decoded string after processing all characters.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a string consisting of lowercase English alphabets. The task is to iteratively remove all occurrences of the substring "abc" from the string until no such substring remains. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to efficiently remove the "abc" substrings:

        1. **Iterate through the String**: For each character in the string, we will process it one by one.
        2. **Use a Stack**: We will use a stack to keep track of the characters that are not part of an "abc" substring.
        3. **Check for "abc"**: As we add each character to the stack, we check if the last three characters in the stack form the substring "abc". If they do, we remove these three characters from the stack.
        4. **Repeat Until Done**: Continue this process until we have processed all characters in the string.
        5. **Resulting String**: The characters remaining in the stack form the resulting string after all "abc" substrings have been removed.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function remove_abc(string):
            stack = empty list
            for each character in string:
                add character to stack
                if last three characters in stack form "abc":
                    remove last three characters from stack
            return join characters in stack to form the resulting string

        function process_test_cases(test_cases):
            results = empty list
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                result = remove_abc(test_case)
                add result to results
            return results
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def remove_abc(s):
            stack = []
            for char in s:
                stack.append(char)
                # Check if the last three characters form "abc"
                if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:
                    # Remove the last three characters
                    stack.pop()
                    stack.pop()
                    stack.pop()
            # Join the stack to form the resulting string
            return ''.join(stack)

        def process_test_cases(test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                result = remove_abc(test_case)
                results.append(result)
            return results

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().strip().split()

        # First line is the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = data[1:T+1]

        # Process each test case
        results = process_test_cases(test_cases)

        # Output results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **remove_abc Function**: This function takes a string and uses a stack to remove all occurrences of the substring "abc". It iterates through each character, adding it to the stack, and checks if the last three characters in the stack form "abc". If they do, it removes them.
        - **process_test_cases Function**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `remove_abc` for each test case and collecting the results.
        - **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. The task is to repeatedly remove any `k` adjacent and equal letters from the string until no such group exists. The result should be the final string after all possible removals.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach:

1. **Stack Utilization**: Use a stack to keep track of characters and their consecutive counts.
2. **Iterate through the String**: For each character in the string, we will process it one by one.
3. **Check for k Consecutive Characters**: As we add each character to the stack, we check if the top of the stack has `k` consecutive characters. If it does, we remove them.
4. **Repeat Until Done**: Continue this process until we have processed all characters in the string.
5. **Resulting String**: The characters remaining in the stack form the resulting string after all possible removals.

function removeDuplicates(s, k):
    stack = empty list
    for each character in s:
        if stack is not empty and stack top character is equal to current character:
            increment the count of the top element in the stack

        if the count of the top element in the stack is equal to k:
            pop the top element from the stack
    result = empty string
    for each (character, count) in stack:

 ### Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. The task is to repeatedly remove any `k` adjacent and equal letters from the string until no such group exists. The result should be the final string after all possible removals.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach:

1. **Stack Utilization**: Use a stack to keep track of characters and their consecutive counts.
2. **Iterate through the String**: For each character in the string, we will process it one by one.
3. **Check for k Consecutive Characters**: As we add each character to the stack, we check if the top of the stack has `k` consecutive characters. If it does, we remove them.
4. **Repeat Until Done**: Continue this process until we have processed all characters in the string.
5. **Resulting String**: The characters remaining in the stack form the resulting string after all possible removals.

            push (character, 1) onto the stack
        if the count of the top element in the stack is equal to k:
            pop the top element from the stack

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently remove `k` consecutive duplicate characters from a string until no such group exists. The solution leveraged a stack-based approach, which is a common pattern for problems involving consecutive elements and removal operations.

### Key Concepts:
- **Stack Utilization**: The stack was used to keep track of characters and their consecutive counts. This allowed for efficient checking and removal of `k` consecutive duplicates.
- **Iterative Processing**: By iterating through the string and updating the stack, we could dynamically manage the characters and their counts, ensuring that any group of `k` duplicates was removed immediately.

### Strategy:
- **Character Counting**: For each character, if it matched the top of the stack, its count was incremented. If the count reached `k`, the character was removed from the stack.
- **Result Construction**: After processing the string, the stack contained the remaining characters and their counts, which were used to construct the final result.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Efficiency**: The stack approach is efficient for this type of problem, as it allows for constant time operations for adding and removing elements.
- **Edge Cases**: The solution naturally handled cases where no duplicates existed or where multiple rounds of removal were necessary.

This problem reinforced the utility of stack data structures in managing sequences and performing operations based on consecutive elements. The approach was straightforward and effective, with no unexpected errors encountered.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The problem of removing `k` adjacent duplicate characters from a string was effectively solved using a stack-based approach. My initial solution was quite similar to the official solution, and both approaches utilized a stack to keep track of characters and their consecutive counts. This method is efficient in both time and space complexity, as it processes each character in the string once and uses a stack to manage the state.

Key insights from the official solution include:

1. **Initialization of the Stack**: The official solution initializes the stack with a dummy element `['*', 0]`. This simplifies the logic by avoiding checks for an empty stack when processing the first character. This is a small but useful trick to streamline the code.

2. **Character and Count Management**: Both solutions maintain a pair of character and its count in the stack. When a character matches the top of the stack, its count is incremented. If the count reaches `k`, the element is popped from the stack.

3. **Result Construction**: The final string is constructed by iterating over the stack and repeating each character according to its count. This ensures that only the characters that were not removed are included in the result.

Overall, the official solution is concise and effectively handles the problem requirements. The use of a dummy element in the stack is a noteworthy technique that can be applied to similar problems to simplify edge case handling.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The function processes a string to remove consecutive duplicate characters that appear exactly 'k' times in a row. It uses a stack to keep track of characters and their consecutive counts as it iterates through the string. When a character matches the one at the top of the stack, its count is incremented; otherwise, the character is added to the stack with a count of one. If a character's count reaches 'k', it is removed from the stack. Finally, the function constructs and returns a new string by repeating each character in the stack according to its count.

[Problem]
    Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
    We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
    Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
    Output: "abcd"
    Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
    Example 2:
    Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
    Output: "aa"
    Explanation: 
    First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
    Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
    Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
    Example 3:
    Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
    Output: "ps"

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 10^5
    2 <= k <= 10^4
    s only contains lower case English letters.
