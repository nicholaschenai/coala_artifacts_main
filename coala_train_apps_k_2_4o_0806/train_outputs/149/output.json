    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. The task is to repeatedly remove any `k` adjacent and equal letters from the string until no such group exists. The result should be the final string after all possible removals.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach:\n\n1. **Stack Utilization**: Use a stack to keep track of characters and their consecutive counts.\n2. **Iterate through the String**: For each character in the string, we will process it one by one.\n3. **Check for k Consecutive Characters**: As we add each character to the stack, we check if the top of the stack has `k` consecutive characters. If it does, we remove them.\n4. **Repeat Until Done**: Continue this process until we have processed all characters in the string.\n5. **Resulting String**: The characters remaining in the stack form the resulting string after all possible removals.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction removeDuplicates(s, k):\n    stack = empty list\n    for each character in s:\n        if stack is not empty and stack top character is equal to current character:\n            increment the count of the top element in the stack\n        else:\n            push (character, 1) onto the stack\n        if the count of the top element in the stack is equal to k:\n            pop the top element from the stack\n    result = empty string\n    for each (character, count) in stack:\n        append character repeated count times to result\n    return result\n```\n\n### Final Python Code\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        # Stack to store characters and their consecutive counts\n        stack = []\n        \n        # Iterate over each character in the string\n        for char in s:\n            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                # If the top of the stack has the same character, increment its count\n                stack[-1][1] += 1\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, push the character with a count of 1\n                stack.append([char, 1])\n            \n            # If the count of the top element reaches k, pop it\n            if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                stack.pop()\n        \n        # Construct the result string from the stack\n        result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)\n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Stack**: Used to keep track of characters and their consecutive counts.\n- **Loop**: Iterates over each character in the string, updating the stack as needed.\n- **Count Check**: If the count of a character reaches `k`, it is removed from the stack.\n- **Result Construction**: The final string is constructed by repeating each character in the stack according to its count.",
