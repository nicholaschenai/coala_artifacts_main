For each question, a range of students' scores is multiplied by the complexity factor. Our task is to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been applied, and output the floor of this mean for each test case.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.\n2. **Apply Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students in the specified range by the complexity factor.\n3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.\n4. **Output Result**: Output the floored mean for each test case.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n    # Initialize scores for N students\n    scores = [10] * N\n    \n    # Process each question\n    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:\n        # Apply the complexity factor k to the scores from index i-1 to j-1\n        for index from i-1 to j-1:\n            scores[index] *= k\n    \n    # Calculate the mean of the scores\n    total_score = sum(scores)\n    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division\n    \n    return mean_score\n\nfunction main():\n    read T  # Number of test cases\n    for each test case:\n        read N, M  # Number of students and number of questions\n        questions = []\n        for M times:\n            read i, j, k  # Question details\n            questions.append((i, j, k))\n        \n        # Process the test case and get the result\n        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n        \n        # Output the result\n        print(result)\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n    # Initialize scores for N students\n    scores = [10] * N\n    \n    # Process each question\n    for i, j, k in questions:\n        # Apply the complexity factor k to the scores from index i-1 to j-1\n        for index in range(i-1, j):\n            scores[index] *= k\n    \n    # Calculate the mean of the scores\n    total_score = sum(scores)\n    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division\n    \n    return mean_score\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        M = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        questions = []\n        for _ in range(M):\n            i = int(data[index])\n            j = int(data[index + 1])\n            k = int(data[index + 2])\n            index += 3\n            questions.append((i, j, k))\n        \n        # Process the test case and get the result\n        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n        \n        # Store the result\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Output all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input data, processes each test case by updating student scores based on the given questions, calculates the mean of the scores, and outputs the floored mean for each test case."

Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.\n\n        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \\equiv qr \\pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \\equiv p_2 q_1 \\pmod m$. Assuming that $\\frac{p_1}{q_1} \\neq \\frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.\n\n        In the statement we were told that $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.\n\n        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr \\;\\bmod\\; m \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \\bmod m$ for $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $\\frac{r}{m} q - k \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\\frac{r}{m}$.\n\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m \n            def mod_min(r, n, m):\n                a = fraction(r, m)\n                p, q = convergents(a)\n                for i in range(2, len(q)):\n                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):\n                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]\n                        return q[i-1] + t*q[i]\n            ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Continued fractions\n    Part: 11/12\n    ```\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # returns [ah, ph, qh] such that points r[i]=(ph[i], qh[i]) constitute upper convex hull\n            # of lattice points on 0 <= x <= N and 0 <= y <= r * x, where r = [a0; a1, a2, ...]\n            # and there are ah[i]-1 integer points on the segment between r[i] and r[i+1]\n            def hull(a, N):\n                p, q = convergents(a)\n                t = N // q[-1]\n                ah = [t]\n                ph = [0, t*p[-1]]\n                qh = [0, t*q[-1]]\n                for i in reversed(range(len(q))):\n                    if i % 2 == 1:\n                        while qh[-1] + q[i-1] <= N:\n                            t = (N - qh[-1] - q[i-1]) // q[i]\n                            dp = p[i-1] + t*p[i]\n                            dq = q[i-1] + t*q[i]\n                            k = (N - qh[-1]) // dq\n                            ah.append(k)\n                            ph.append(ph[-1] + k * dp)\n                            qh.append(qh[-1] + k * dq)\n                return ah, ph, qh\n            ```\n\n    !!! example \"[Timus - Crime and Punishment](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1430)\"\n        You're given integer numbers $A$, $B$ and $N$.

Optimal $y$ for each $x$ has a value of $\\lfloor \\frac{Ax + (N \\bmod A)}{B} \\rfloor$.\n\n        To treat it more generically, we will write a function that finds the best point on $0 \\leq x \\leq N$ and $y = \\lfloor \\frac{Ax+B}{C} \\rfloor$.\n\n        Core solution idea in this problem essentially repeats the previous problem, but instead of using lower semiconvergents to diverge from line, you use upper semiconvergents to get closer to the line without crossing it and without violating $x \\leq N$. Unfortunately, unlike the previous problem, you need to make sure that you don't cross the $y=\\frac{Ax+B}{C}$ line while getting closer to it, so you should keep it in mind when calculating semiconvergent's coefficient $t$.\n\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # (x, y) such that y = (A*x+B) // C,\n            # Cy - Ax is max and 0 <= x <= N.\n            def closest(A, B, C, N):\n                # y <= (A*x + B)/C <=> diff(x, y) <= B\n                def diff(x, y):\n                    return C*y-A*x\n                a = fraction(A, C)\n                p, q = convergents(a)\n                ph = [B // C]\n                qh = [0]\n                for i in range(2, len(q) - 1):\n                    if i % 2 == 0:\n                        while diff(qh[-1] + q[i+1], ph[-1] + p[i+1]) <= B:\n                            t = 1 + (diff(qh[-1] + q[i-1], ph[-1] + p[i-1]) - B - 1) // abs(diff(q[i], p[i]))\n                            dp = p[i-1] + t*p[i]\n                            dq = q[i-1] + t*q[i]\n                            k = (N - qh[-1]) // dq\n                            if k == 0:\n                                return qh[-1], ph[-1]\n                            if diff(dq, dp) != 0:\n                                k = min(k, (B - diff(qh[-1], ph[-1])) // diff(dq, dp))\n                            qh.append(qh[-1] + k*dq)\n                            ph.append(ph[-1] + k*dp)\n                return qh[-1], ph[-1]\n\n            def solve(A, B, N):\n                x, y = closest(A, N % A, B, N // A)\n                return N // A - x, y\n            ```\n\n    !!! example \"[June Challenge 2017 - Euler Sum](https://www.codechef.com/problems/ES)\"\n        Compute $\\sum\\limits_{x=1}^N \\lfloor ex \\rfloor$, where $e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, \\dots, 1, 2n, 1, \\dots]$ is the Euler's number and $N \\leq 10^{4000}$.\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n        This sum is equal to the number of lattice point $(x;y)$ such that $1 \\leq x \\leq N$ and $1 \\leq y \\leq ex$.    \n\n        After constructing the convex hull of the points below $y=ex$, this number can be computed using [Pick's theorem](../geometry/picks-theorem.md):\n\n        === \"C++\"\n            ```cpp\n            // sum floor(k * x) for k in [1, N] and x = [a0; a1, a2, ...]\n            int sum_floor(auto a, int N) {\n                N++;\n                auto [ah, ph, qh] = hull(a, N);\n\n                // The number of lattice points within a vertical right trapezoid\n                // on points (0; 0) - (0; y1) - (dx; y2) - (dx; 0) that has\n                // a+1 integer points on the segment (0; y1) - (dx; y2).\n                auto picks = [](int y1, int y2, int dx, int a) {\n                    int b = y1 + y2 + a + dx;\n                    int A = (y1 + y2) * dx;\n                    return (A - b + 2) / 2 + b - (y2 + 1);\n                };\n\n                int ans = 0;\n                for(size_t i = 1; i < qh.size(); i++) {\n                    ans += picks(ph[i - 1], ph[i], qh[i] - qh[i - 1], ah[i - 1]);\n                }\n                return ans - N;\n            }\n            ```\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # sum floor(k * x) for k in [1, N] and x = [a0; a1, a2, ...]\n            def sum_floor(a, N):\n                N += 1\n                ah, ph, qh = hull(a, N)\n\n                # The number of lattice points within a vertical right trapezoid\n                # on points (0; 0) - (0; y1) - (dx; y2) - (dx; 0) that has\n                # a+1 integer points on the segment (0; y1) - (dx; y2).\n                def picks(y1, y2, dx, a):\n                    b = y1 + y2 + a + dx\n                    A = (y1 + y2) * dx\n                    return (A - b + 2) // 2 + b - (y2 + 1)\n\n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(1, len(qh)):\n                    ans += picks(ph[i-1], ph[i], qh[i]-qh[i-1], ah[i-1])\n                return ans - N\n            ``` \n\n    !!! example \"[NAIPC 2019 - It's a Mod, Mod, Mod, Mod World](https://open.kattis.com/problems/itsamodmodmodmodworld)\"\n        Given $p$, $q$ and $n$, compute $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n [p \\cdot i \\bmod q]$.\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n        This problem reduces to the previous one if you note that $a \\bmod b = a - \\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\rfloor b$.

When a student solves a question, their score is multiplied by the complexity factor. The task is to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been assigned and solved. The mean should be floored to the nearest integer.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.\n2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity factor.\n3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and floor the result.\n4. **Output**: Print the floored mean for each test case.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n    scores = array of size N initialized to 10\n    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:\n        for student in range i to j:\n            scores[student] *= k\n    total_score = sum of scores\n    mean_score = total_score // N\n    return mean_score\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read N, M\n        questions = []\n        for M times:\n            read i, j, k\n            questions.append((i-1, j-1, k))  # Convert to 0-based index\n        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n        print result\n```\n\n### Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n    # Initialize scores for all students\n    scores = [10] * N\n    \n    # Process each question\n    for i, j, k in questions:\n        for student in range(i, j + 1):\n            scores[student] *= k\n    \n    # Calculate the mean of the scores\n    total_score = sum(scores)\n    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division\n    \n    return mean_score\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        M = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        questions = []\n        for _ in range(M):\n            i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index\n            j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index\n            k = int(data[index + 2])\n            index += 3\n            questions.append((i, j, k))\n        \n        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code reads input directly from standard input, processes each test case by updating student scores based on the given questions, and then calculates and prints the floored mean of the scores for each test case."

This suggests that the `main()` function, which contains the logic for reading input and producing output, is not being executed. In Python scripts, especially when using functions, it's crucial to ensure that the main logic is called when the script is executed.\n\n### Steps to Fix the Issue\n\n1. **Ensure Execution of Main Logic**: The `main()` function should be called explicitly at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.\n\n2. **Review Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly and that the indices are being managed properly, especially when converting from 1-based to 0-based indexing.\n\n3. **Output the Results**: Ensure that the results are being printed correctly after processing each test case.\n\n### Revised Code\n\n```python\ndef process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n    # Initialize scores for all students\n    scores = [10] * N\n    \n    # Process each question\n    for i, j, k in questions:\n        for student in range(i, j + 1):\n            scores[student] *= k\n    \n    # Calculate the mean of the scores\n    total_score = sum(scores)\n    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division\n    \n    return mean_score\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        M = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        questions = []\n        for _ in range(M):\n            i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index\n            j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index\n            k = int(data[index + 2])\n            index += 3\n            questions.append((i, j, k))\n        \n        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Ensure the main function is called\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Calling `main()`**: Added a check to call `main()` when the script is executed. This ensures that the input is processed and output is generated.\n- **Input Handling**: The input reading and processing logic remains the same, ensuring that indices are correctly converted from 1-based to 0-based.\n- **Output**: The results are collected in a list and printed after processing all test cases. This ensures that the output is generated as expected."

He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can leverage the concept of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). The idea is that the books that are already in the correct order form an increasing subsequence. The minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of this longest increasing subsequence.

Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.\n\n        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \\equiv qr \\pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \\equiv p_2 q_1 \\pmod m$.

For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.\n\n        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr \\;\\bmod\\; m \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \\bmod m$ for $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $\\frac{r}{m} q - k \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\\frac{r}{m}$.\n\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m \n            def mod_min(r, n, m):\n                a = fraction(r, m)\n                p, q = convergents(a)\n                for i in range(2, len(q)):\n                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):\n                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]\n                        return q[i-1] + t*q[i]\n            ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The task was to efficiently handle potentially large input sizes.\n\n#### Key Insights from My Solution:\n- **Initialization and Updates**: I initialized all student scores to 10 and updated them based on the given questions. This approach was straightforward and aligned with the problem requirements.\n- **Handling Input and Output**: I used Python's `sys.stdin.read` for efficient input handling, which is crucial for large input sizes. This was a good choice given the constraints.\n- **Index Management**: I correctly managed the conversion from 1-based to 0-based indexing, which is a common requirement in competitive programming.\n\n#### Comparison with the Official Solution:\n- **Data Structure Choice**: The official solution used a dictionary to store scores, which is efficient in terms of space when only a subset of students' scores are updated. My solution used a list, which is simpler but may use more space if many students are not affected by any questions.\n- **Error Handling**: The official solution included a try-except block to handle potential input errors gracefully. This is a good practice in competitive programming to avoid runtime errors.\n- **Efficiency**: Both solutions effectively handle the problem within the constraints, but the dictionary approach in the official solution could be more space-efficient in scenarios where only a few students are affected by questions.\n\nOverall, my solution was correct and efficient, but the official solution provided an alternative approach using a dictionary, which could be beneficial in certain scenarios.
