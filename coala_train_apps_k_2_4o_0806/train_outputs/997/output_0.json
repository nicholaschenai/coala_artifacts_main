    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Throughout the month, the teacher assigns questions with a complexity factor. When a student solves a question, their score is multiplied by the complexity factor. The task is to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been assigned and solved. The mean should be floored to the nearest integer.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.\n2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity factor.\n3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and floor the result.\n4. **Output**: Print the floored mean for each test case.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n    scores = array of size N initialized to 10\n    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:\n        for student in range i to j:\n            scores[student] *= k\n    total_score = sum of scores\n    mean_score = total_score // N\n    return mean_score\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read N, M\n        questions = []\n        for M times:\n            read i, j, k\n            questions.append((i-1, j-1, k))  # Convert to 0-based index\n        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n        print result\n```\n\n### Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n    # Initialize scores for all students\n    scores = [10] * N\n    \n    # Process each question\n    for i, j, k in questions:\n        for student in range(i, j + 1):\n            scores[student] *= k\n    \n    # Calculate the mean of the scores\n    total_score = sum(scores)\n    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division\n    \n    return mean_score\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        M = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        questions = []\n        for _ in range(M):\n            i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index\n            j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index\n            k = int(data[index + 2])\n            index += 3\n            questions.append((i, j, k))\n        \n        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code reads input directly from standard input, processes each test case by updating student scores based on the given questions, and then calculates and prints the floored mean of the scores for each test case.",
