INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Over a month, the teacher assigns several questions, each with a complexity factor. For each question, a range of students' scores is multiplied by the complexity factor. Our task is to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been applied, and output the floor of this mean for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Apply Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students in the specified range by the complexity factor.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.
4. **Output Result**: Output the floored mean for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for N students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        # Apply the complexity factor k to the scores from index i-1 to j-1
        for index from i-1 to j-1:
            scores[index] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T  # Number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read N, M  # Number of students and number of questions
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k  # Question details
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        # Process the test case and get the result
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        
        # Output the result
        print(result)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for N students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        # Apply the complexity factor k to the scores from index i-1 to j-1
        for index in range(i-1, j):
            scores[index] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index])
            j = int(data[index + 1])
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        # Process the test case and get the result
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        
        # Store the result
        results.append(result)
    
    # Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input data, processes each test case by updating student scores based on the given questions, calculates the mean of the scores, and outputs the floored mean for each test case.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m 
            def mod_min(r, n, m):

                p, q = convergents(a)
                for i in range(2, len(q)):
                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):
                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]

    !!! example "[Timus - Crime and Punishment](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1430)"
        You're given integer numbers $A$, $B$ and $N$. Find $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$ such that $Ax + By \leq N$ and $Ax + By$ is the maximum possible.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        In this problem it holds that $1 \leq A, B, N \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$, so it can be solved in $O(\sqrt N)$. However, there is $O(\log N)$ solution with continued fractions.

        For our convenience, we will invert the direction of $x$ by doing a substitution $x \mapsto \lfloor \frac{N}{A}\rfloor - x$, so that now we need to find the point $(x; y)$ such that $0 \leq x \leq \lfloor \frac{N}{A} \rfloor$, $By - Ax \leq N \;\bmod\; A$ and $By - Ax$ is the maximum possible. Optimal $y$ for each $x$ has a value of $\lfloor \frac{Ax + (N \bmod A)}{B} \rfloor$.

        To treat it more generically, we will write a function that finds the best point on $0 \leq x \leq N$ and $y = \lfloor \frac{Ax+B}{C} \rfloor$.

        Core solution idea in this problem essentially repeats the previous problem, but instead of using lower semiconvergents to diverge from line, you use upper semiconvergents to get closer to the line without crossing it and without violating $x \leq N$. Unfortunately, unlike the previous problem, you need to make sure that you don't cross the $y=\frac{Ax+B}{C}$ line while getting closer to it, so you should keep it in mind when calculating semiconvergent's coefficient $t$.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Throughout the month, the teacher assigns questions with a complexity factor. When a student solves a question, their score is multiplied by the complexity factor. The task is to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been assigned and solved. The mean should be floored to the nearest integer.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity factor.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and floor the result.
4. **Output**: Print the floored mean for each test case.

### Pseudocode

    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for student in range i to j:
            scores[student] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
- Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$
- $1 \leq k \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----

Original Constraints 

-----Sample Input:-----
1
5 3
1 3 5
2 5 2
3 4 7

-----Sample Output:-----
202

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Initial score of students will be : $[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$
after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 50, 50, 10, 10]$
after solving question 2 scores will be: $[50, 100, 100, 20, 20]$
after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 100, 700, 140, 20]$
Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will $(50+100+700+140+20)/5 = 202$

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Throughout the month, the teacher assigns questions with a complexity factor. When a student solves a question, their score is multiplied by the complexity factor. The task is to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been assigned and solved. The mean should be floored to the nearest integer.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity factor.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and floor the result.
4. **Output**: Print the floored mean for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for student in range i to j:
            scores[student] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, M
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k
            questions.append((i-1, j-1, k))  # Convert to 0-based index
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        print result
```

### Final Python Code

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for all students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        for student in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[student] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads input directly from standard input, processes each test case by updating student scores based on the given questions, and then calculates and prints the floored mean of the scores for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the `main()` function, which contains the logic for reading input and producing output, is not being executed. In Python scripts, especially when using functions, it's crucial to ensure that the main logic is called when the script is executed.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure Execution of Main Logic**: The `main()` function should be called explicitly at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Review Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly and that the indices are being managed properly, especially when converting from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

3. **Output the Results**: Ensure that the results are being printed correctly after processing each test case.

### Revised Code

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for all students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        for student in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[student] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Ensure the main function is called
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Calling `main()`**: Added a check to call `main()` when the script is executed. This ensures that the input is processed and output is generated.
- **Input Handling**: The input reading and processing logic remains the same, ensuring that indices are correctly converted from 1-based to 0-based.
- **Output**: The results are collected in a list and printed after processing all test cases. This ensures that the output is generated as expected.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Throughout the month, the teacher assigns questions with a complexity factor. When a student solves a question, their score is multiplied by the complexity factor. The task is to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been assigned and solved. The mean should be floored to the nearest integer.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity factor.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and floor the result.
4. **Output**: Print the floored mean for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for student in range i to j:
            scores[student] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, M
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k
            questions.append((i-1, j-1, k))  # Convert to 0-based index
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        print result
```

### Final Python Code

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for all students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        for student in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[student] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

    [Task]:
        Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
        He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
        21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
        Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
        12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
        Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
        12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
        Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are not in order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can leverage the concept of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). The idea is that the books that are already in the correct order form an increasing subsequence. The minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of this longest increasing subsequence. This is because the books that are not part of the LIS need to be moved to achieve the sorted order.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Function findLISLength(arr):
               Initialize an empty list 'lis'
               For each book in arr:
                   If lis is empty or book is greater than the last element in lis:

                            left = mid + 1
                        else:
                            right = mid
                    # Replace the element at the found position with the current book
                    lis[left] = book
            # Return the length of the LIS
            return len(lis)

        def minMovesToSortBooks(N, books):
            # Calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence
            lis_length = findLISLength(books)
            # The minimum number of moves is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS
            return N - lis_length

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        N = int(data[0])
        books = list(map(int, data[1:]))

        # Output the result
        print(minMovesToSortBooks(N, books))
        ```

        This solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of moves required to sort the books by finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence and subtracting it from the total number of books.

        Given $N$, $M$, $A$ and $B$, compute $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{N-1} \lfloor \frac{A \cdot i + B}{M} \rfloor$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m 
            def mod_min(r, n, m):
                a = fraction(r, m)
                p, q = convergents(a)
                for i in range(2, len(q)):
                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):
                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]
                        return q[i-1] + t*q[i]

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Throughout the month, the teacher assigns questions with a complexity factor. When a student solves a question, their score is multiplied by the complexity factor. The task is to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been assigned and solved. The mean should be floored to the nearest integer.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity factor.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the `main()` function, which contains the logic for reading input and producing output, is not being executed. In Python scripts, especially when using functions, it's crucial to ensure that the main logic is called when the script is executed.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure Execution of Main Logic**: The `main()` function should be called explicitly at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Review Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly and that the indices are being managed properly, especially when converting from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

3. **Output the Results**: Ensure that the results are being printed correctly after processing each test case.

### Revised Code

### Explanation of Changes

- **Calling `main()`**: Added a check to call `main()` when the script is executed. This ensures that the input is processed and output is generated.
- **Input Handling**: The input reading and processing logic remains the same, ensuring that indices are correctly converted from 1-based to 0-based.
- **Output**: The results are collected in a list and printed after processing all test cases. This ensures that the output is generated as expected.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with given complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

The core concept here was to efficiently update the scores of students over a range of indices and then compute the mean of these scores. The challenge was to handle potentially large input sizes, which required careful management of input reading and processing.

Initially, the code failed to produce output because the `main()` function was not being called. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by adding a check to call `main()` when the script is executed. This is a common pattern in Python scripts to ensure that the main logic is executed.

The solution involved:
- Initializing an array to store scores for each student.
- Iterating over each question and updating the scores for the specified range of students.
- Calculating the total score and using floor division to find the mean.

This problem reinforced the importance of handling input/output correctly and ensuring that the main logic is executed. It also highlighted the need to efficiently manage operations over potentially large datasets, which is a common requirement in competitive programming.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
- Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$
- $1 \leq k \leq 100$

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Initial score of students will be : $[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$
after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 50, 50, 10, 10]$
after solving question 2 scores will be: $[50, 100, 100, 20, 20]$
after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 100, 700, 140, 20]$
Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will $(50+100+700+140+20)/5 = 202$

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Throughout the month, the teacher assigns questions with a complexity factor. When a student solves a question, their score is multiplied by the complexity factor. The task is to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been assigned and solved. The mean should be floored to the nearest integer.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity factor.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and floor the result.
4. **Output**: Print the floored mean for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for student in range i to j:
            scores[student] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, M
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k
            questions.append((i-1, j-1, k))  # Convert to 0-based index
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        print result

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem involved updating scores for a range of students based on the complexity of questions and then calculating the mean of these scores. The task was to efficiently handle potentially large input sizes.

#### Key Insights from My Solution:
- **Initialization and Updates**: I initialized all student scores to 10 and updated them based on the given questions. This approach was straightforward and aligned with the problem requirements.
- **Handling Input and Output**: I used Python's `sys.stdin.read` for efficient input handling, which is crucial for large input sizes. This was a good choice given the constraints.
- **Index Management**: I correctly managed the conversion from 1-based to 0-based indexing, which is a common requirement in competitive programming.

#### Comparison with the Official Solution:
- **Data Structure Choice**: The official solution used a dictionary to store scores, which is efficient in terms of space when only a subset of students' scores are updated. My solution used a list, which is simpler but may use more space if many students are not affected by any questions.
- **Error Handling**: The official solution included a try-except block to handle potential input errors gracefully. This is a good practice in competitive programming to avoid runtime errors.
- **Efficiency**: Both solutions effectively handle the problem within the constraints, but the dictionary approach in the official solution could be more space-efficient in scenarios where only a few students are affected by questions.

Overall, my solution was correct and efficient, but the official solution provided an alternative approach using a dictionary, which could be beneficial in certain scenarios. This experience reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structures based on the problem constraints and requirements.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes multiple test cases, each specifying the number of students, the number of questions, and the details of each question. For each test case, it initializes a list of scores for the students, all starting at 10, and processes each question by multiplying the scores of a specified range of students by a given factor. After processing all questions for a test case, it calculates the mean score of all students using floor division and stores the result. Finally, it prints the mean score for each test case.

[Problem]
    Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
    At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
    This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
    Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
    - Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

    -----Output:-----
    For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
    - $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
    - $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$
    - $1 \leq k \leq 100$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask1 
    - 
    $1 \leq T \leq 10$
    - 
    $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^4$
    Subtask2
    - 
    Original Constraints 

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    5 3
    1 3 5
    2 5 2
    3 4 7

    -----Sample Output:-----
    202

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    Initial score of students will be : $[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$
    after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 50, 50, 10, 10]$
    after solving question 2 scores will be: $[50, 100, 100, 20, 20]$
    after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 100, 700, 140, 20]$
    Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will $(50+100+700+140+20)/5 = 202$
