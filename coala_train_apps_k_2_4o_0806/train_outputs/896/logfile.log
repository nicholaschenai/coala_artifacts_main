## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, each defined by two integers [Li, Ri]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by performing a series of operations on the segments in sequence. The operations allowed are shifting the left or right border of a segment by one unit, either increasing or decreasing it. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: 
   - You can increase or decrease the left or right border of a segment.
   - You cannot make a segment empty (i.e., L should never equal R).

2. **Transformation Process**:
   - For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment.
   - Calculate the difference in the left and right borders between the current and next segment.
   - Use the minimal number of operations to adjust the borders to match the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest one. The order of operations is: L+, L-, R+, R-.

4. **Iterate Over Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, read the number of segments and the segments themselves.
   - For each segment, compute the operations needed to transform it into the next segment.
   - Accumulate the operations and count them.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the total number of operations and the sequence of operations.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        operations = []
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            while current_segment != next_segment:
                if current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                    operations.append("L+")
                    current_segment.L += 1
                elif current_segment.L > next_segment.L:
                    operations.append("L-")
                    current_segment.L -= 1
                elif current_segment.R < next_segment.R:
                    operations.append("R+")
                    current_segment.R += 1
                elif current_segment.R > next_segment.R:
                    operations.append("R-")
                    current_segment.R -= 1
        print number of operations
        print operations as a string
```

### Python Code

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = []
        
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_L, current_R = segments[i]
            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Transform current segment to the next segment
            while current_L != next_L or current_R != next_R:
                if current_L < next_L:
                    operations.append("L+")
                    current_L += 1
                elif current_L > next_L:
                    operations.append("L-")
                    current_L -= 1
                elif current_R < next_R:
                    operations.append("R+")
                    current_R += 1
                elif current_R > next_R:
                    operations.append("R-")
                    current_R -= 1
        
        results.append((len(operations), ''.join(operations)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result[0])
        print(result[1])

# Example usage:
# T = 4
# test_cases = [
#     (3, [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (3, 5)]),
#     (1, [(0, 1)]),
#     (3, [(-2, -1), (-2, -1), (-2, 0)]),
#     (4, [(4, 6), (3, 5), (-1, 1), (1, 2)])
# ]
# transform_segments(T, test_cases)
```

This code reads the number of test cases and segments, then iteratively transforms each segment to the next one using the minimal number of operations, while ensuring the operations are lexicographically minimal. The results are printed for each test case.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a string consisting of uppercase English letters. We are allowed to perform at most one operation where we can remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our task is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we need to consider the following:

        1. **Identify the smallest character**: We should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible.
        2. **Positioning**: If the smallest character is not already at the beginning, we should move it to the start. If it is already at the start, we should look for the next smallest character that can be moved to improve the order.
        3. **Iterate through the string**: For each character, check if moving it to the start or another position can result in a smaller string.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
            smallest_string = S
            for i from 0 to length of S - 1:
                for j from 0 to length of S - 1:
                    if i != j:
                        # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j
                        new_string = S with character at i removed and inserted at j
                        if new_string is lexicographically smaller than smallest_string:
                            smallest_string = new_string
            return smallest_string

        function process_test_cases(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, S = test_case
                result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)
                add result to results
            return results
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
            smallest_string = S
            N = len(S)
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(N):
                    if i != j:
                        # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j
                        new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]
                        new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]
                        if new_string < smallest_string:
                            smallest_string = new_string

                result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)
                results.append(result)
            return results

        # First line is the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            S = data[index + 1]
            test_cases.append((N, S))
            index += 2

        # Process each test case
        results = process_test_cases(T, test_cases)

        # Output results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **find_lexicographically_smallest_string Function**: This function iterates over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. It checks if the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the current smallest string found.
        - **process_test_cases Function**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` for each test case and collecting the results.
        - **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing at most one operation of removing a character from any position in the string and inserting it back at any other position. The key concept here was to leverage the ability to reposition characters to achieve a smaller lexicographical order.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Lexicographical Order**: Understanding how strings are compared based on character order was crucial. The task was essentially about rearranging characters to achieve the smallest possible order.
    - **Character Repositioning**: The problem allowed for one character to be moved, which meant exploring all possible single-character moves to find the optimal configuration.

    ### Strategy
    The strategy involved iterating over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. This brute-force approach was feasible given the constraints (maximum string length of 50 and up to 50 test cases).

    ### Code Snippet
    The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` was central to the solution. It iterated over all possible character moves and checked if the resulting string was smaller than the current smallest found:

    ```python
    def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
        smallest_string = S
        N = len(S)
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if i != j:
                    new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]

        return smallest_string
    ```

    ### Outcome
    The solution was effective and passed all test cases. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and lexicographical order, as well as the utility of brute-force approaches when constraints are manageable.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to achieve this transformation.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: For each segment transformation, we can perform operations to adjust the left and right borders. The operations are:
   - `L+`: Increase the left border by 1.
   - `L-`: Decrease the left border by 1.
   - `R+`: Increase the right border by 1.
   - `R-`: Decrease the right border by 1.

2. **Transformation Strategy**: For each segment transformation from `[Li, Ri]` to `[Li+1, Ri+1]`:
   - Calculate the difference in the left borders (`delta_L = Li+1 - Li`).
   - Calculate the difference in the right borders (`delta_R = Ri+1 - Ri`).
   - Use the operations to adjust the borders:
     - If `delta_L > 0`, perform `L+` operations.
     - If `delta_L < 0`, perform `L-` operations.
     - If `delta_R > 0`, perform `R+` operations.
     - If `delta_R < 0`, perform `R-` operations.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: Start from the first segment and apply the necessary operations to transform it into the next segment, continuing until the last segment is reached.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i+1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L
            elif delta_L < 0:
                operations += "L-" * (-delta_L)

        results.append((total_operations, operations))
    return results

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1

Output:

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. The operations must be lexicographically minimal when multiple sequences have the same number of operations.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The current solution does not correctly handle the lexicographical order of operations. The order should be `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`, but the solution does not ensure this order when applying operations.

2. **Output Format**: The solution does not correctly handle the output format, especially when there are no operations needed (e.g., when the segments are already the same).

3. **Logic for Operations**: The logic for applying operations might not be correctly implemented to ensure the minimal number of operations and the correct order.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Lexicographical Order**: When applying operations, ensure that `L+` and `L-` are applied before `R+` and `R-` if they result in the same number of operations.

2. **Handle No Operations Case**: If no operations are needed, ensure the output is correctly formatted with zero operations and an empty sequence.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Re-evaluate the logic for calculating the number of operations and ensure that the operations are applied in the correct order.

### Revised Solution

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i in range(N - 1):
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            
            # Apply L+ and L- first for lexicographical order
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L
            elif delta_L < 0:
                operations += "L-" * (-delta_L)
            
            # Apply R+ and R- after L operations
            if delta_R > 0:
                operations += "R+" * delta_R
            elif delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)
        
        results.append((total_operations, operations))
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    segments = []
    for _ in range(N):
        L, R = map(int, data[index + 1:index + 3])
        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append((N, segments))

# Process each test case
results = transform_segments(T, test_cases)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result[0])
    print(result[1])
```

### Explanation of the Revised Code

- **Lexicographical Order**: The operations `L+` and `L-` are applied before `R+` and `R-` to ensure the lexicographically smallest sequence.
- **Output Handling**: The code correctly handles cases where no operations are needed by ensuring the output is formatted correctly.
- **Logic Correction**: The logic for calculating and applying operations is re-evaluated to ensure correctness.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:

1
0 1

-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to achieve this transformation.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: For each segment transformation, we can perform operations to adjust the left and right borders. The operations are:
   - `L+`: Increase the left border by 1.
   - `L-`: Decrease the left border by 1.
   - `R+`: Increase the right border by 1.
   - `R-`: Decrease the right border by 1.

2. **Transformation Strategy**: For each segment transformation from `[Li, Ri]` to `[Li+1, Ri+1]`:
   - Calculate the difference in the left borders (`delta_L = Li+1 - Li`).
   - Calculate the difference in the right borders (`delta_R = Ri+1 - Ri`).
   - Use the operations to adjust the borders:
     - If `delta_L > 0`, perform `L+` operations.
     - If `delta_L < 0`, perform `L-` operations.
     - If `delta_R > 0`, perform `R+` operations.
     - If `delta_R < 0`, perform `R-` operations.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: Start from the first segment and apply the necessary operations to transform it into the next segment, continuing until the last segment is reached.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i+1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L
            elif delta_L < 0:
                operations += "L-" * (-delta_L)
            if delta_R > 0:
                operations += "R+" * delta_R
            elif delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)
        results.append((total_operations, operations))
    return results

# Read input and process each test case
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""

            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            if delta_L > 0:

                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)

### Explanation of the Code

- **transform_segments Function**: This function processes each test case by iterating through the segments and calculating the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one. It accumulates the total number of operations and constructs the sequence of operations.
- **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a string consisting of uppercase English letters. We are allowed to perform at most one operation where we can remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our task is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we need to consider the following:

        1. **Identify the smallest character**: We should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible.
        2. **Positioning**: If the smallest character is not already at the beginning, we should move it to the start. If it is already at the start, we should look for the next smallest character that can be moved to improve the order.
        3. **Iterate through the string**: For each character, check if moving it to the start or another position can result in a smaller string.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
            smallest_string = S
            for i from 0 to length of S - 1:

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **find_lexicographically_smallest_string Function**: This function iterates over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. It checks if the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the current smallest string found.
        - **process_test_cases Function**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` for each test case and collecting the results.
        - **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

    [description for function: process_test_cases]
    The function takes an integer T and a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer N and a string S. It processes each test case by finding the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by moving one character in the string S to a different position. The results for each test case are collected in a list. Finally, the function returns the list of results.

    [end of description]
    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to rearrange characters in a string to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order with minimal operations. This can be applied in text processing, data sorting, and optimization problems where constraints limit the number of operations. Understanding how to manipulate strings efficiently is crucial in competitive programming and algorithm design, especially when dealing with constraints on operations and input size. The solution demonstrates a brute-force approach to explore all possible single-character moves, which is feasible given the problem's constraints, and can be adapted to similar problems with slight variations in constraints or objectives.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4

3 5
-1 1

Output:

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to achieve this transformation.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: For each segment transformation, we can perform operations to adjust the left and right borders. The operations are:
   - `L+`: Increase the left border by 1.
   - `L-`: Decrease the left border by 1.
   - `R+`: Increase the right border by 1.
   - `R-`: Decrease the right border by 1.

2. **Transformation Strategy**: For each segment transformation from `[Li, Ri]` to `[Li+1, Ri+1]`:
   - Calculate the difference in the left borders (`delta_L = Li+1 - Li`).
   - Calculate the difference in the right borders (`delta_R = Ri+1 - Ri`).
   - Use the operations to adjust the borders:
     - If `delta_L > 0`, perform `L+` operations.
     - If `delta_L < 0`, perform `L-` operations.
     - If `delta_R > 0`, perform `R+` operations.
     - If `delta_R < 0`, perform `R-` operations.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: Start from the first segment and apply the necessary operations to transform it into the next segment, continuing until the last segment is reached.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i+1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L
            elif delta_L < 0:
                operations += "L-" * (-delta_L)
            if delta_R > 0:
                operations += "R+" * delta_R
            elif delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)
        results.append((total_operations, operations))
    return results

# Read input and process each test case
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):

### Explanation of the Code

- **transform_segments Function**: This function processes each test case by iterating through the segments and calculating the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one. It accumulates the total number of operations and constructs the sequence of operations.
- **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. The operations must be lexicographically minimal when multiple sequences have the same number of operations.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The current solution does not correctly handle the lexicographical order of operations. The order should be `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`, but the solution does not ensure this order when applying operations.

2. **Output Format**: The solution does not correctly handle the output format, especially when there are no operations needed (e.g., when the segments are already the same).

3. **Logic for Operations**: The logic for applying operations might not be correctly implemented to ensure the minimal number of operations and the correct order.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Lexicographical Order**: When applying operations, ensure that `L+` and `L-` are applied before `R+` and `R-` if they result in the same number of operations.

2. **Handle No Operations Case**: If no operations are needed, ensure the output is correctly formatted with zero operations and an empty sequence.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Re-evaluate the logic for calculating the number of operations and ensure that the operations are applied in the correct order.

### Revised Solution

def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []

            delta_L = L2 - L1

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:

-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to achieve this transformation.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: For each segment transformation, we can perform operations to adjust the left and right borders. The operations are:
   - `L+`: Increase the left border by 1.
   - `L-`: Decrease the left border by 1.
   - `R+`: Increase the right border by 1.
   - `R-`: Decrease the right border by 1.

2. **Transformation Strategy**: For each segment transformation from `[Li, Ri]` to `[Li+1, Ri+1]`:
   - Calculate the difference in the left borders (`delta_L = Li+1 - Li`).
   - Calculate the difference in the right borders (`delta_R = Ri+1 - Ri`).
   - Use the operations to adjust the borders:
     - If `delta_L > 0`, perform `L+` operations.
     - If `delta_L < 0`, perform `L-` operations.
     - If `delta_R > 0`, perform `R+` operations.
     - If `delta_R < 0`, perform `R-` operations.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: Start from the first segment and apply the necessary operations to transform it into the next segment, continuing until the last segment is reached.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i+1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L
            elif delta_L < 0:
                operations += "L-" * (-delta_L)
            if delta_R > 0:
                operations += "R+" * delta_R
            elif delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)
        results.append((total_operations, operations))
    return results

# Read input and process each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **transform_segments Function**: This function processes each test case by iterating through the segments and calculating the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one. It accumulates the total number of operations and constructs the sequence of operations.
- **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. The operations must be lexicographically minimal when multiple sequences have the same number of operations.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The current solution does not correctly handle the lexicographical order of operations. The order should be `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`, but the solution does not ensure this order when applying operations.

2. **Output Format**: The solution does not correctly handle the output format, especially when there are no operations needed (e.g., when the segments are already the same).

3. **Logic for Operations**: The logic for applying operations might not be correctly implemented to ensure the minimal number of operations and the correct order.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Lexicographical Order**: When applying operations, ensure that `L+` and `L-` are applied before `R+` and `R-` if they result in the same number of operations.

2. **Handle No Operations Case**: If no operations are needed, ensure the output is correctly formatted with zero operations and an empty sequence.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Re-evaluate the logic for calculating the number of operations and ensure that the operations are applied in the correct order.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

        Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

        -----Input-----
        The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
        The second line contains the string S.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
        - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
        - S will consist of uppercase English letters.

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        2
        4
        DCBA
        7
        XYZZYZZ

        Output:
        ADCB
        XYYZZZZ

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
        Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a string consisting of uppercase English letters. We are allowed to perform at most one operation where we can remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our task is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we need to consider the following:

        1. **Identify the smallest character**: We should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible.
        2. **Positioning**: If the smallest character is not already at the beginning, we should move it to the start. If it is already at the start, we should look for the next smallest character that can be moved to improve the order.
        3. **Iterate through the string**: For each character, check if moving it to the start or another position can result in a smaller string.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
            smallest_string = S
            for i from 0 to length of S - 1:
                for j from 0 to length of S - 1:
                    if i != j:
                        # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j
                        new_string = S with character at i removed and inserted at j
                        if new_string is lexicographically smaller than smallest_string:
                            smallest_string = new_string
            return smallest_string

        function process_test_cases(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, S = test_case
                result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)
                add result to results
            return results
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **find_lexicographically_smallest_string Function**: This function iterates over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. It checks if the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the current smallest string found.
        - **process_test_cases Function**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` for each test case and collecting the results.
        - **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

    [description for function: process_test_cases]
    The function takes an integer T and a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer N and a string S. It processes each test case by finding the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by moving one character in the string S to a different position. The results for each test case are collected in a list. Finally, the function returns the list of results.

    [end of description]
    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to rearrange characters in a string to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order with minimal operations. This can be applied in text processing, data sorting, and optimization problems where constraints limit the number of operations. Understanding how to manipulate strings efficiently is crucial in competitive programming and algorithm design, especially when dealing with constraints on operations and input size. The solution demonstrates a brute-force approach to explore all possible single-character moves, which is feasible given the problem's constraints, and can be adapted to similar problems with slight variations in constraints or objectives.

- **Output Handling**: The code correctly handles cases where no operations are needed by ensuring the output is formatted correctly.
- **Logic Correction**: The logic for calculating and applying operations is re-evaluated to ensure correctness. The operations are accumulated in a string, and the total number of operations is counted.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1
1 2

Output:

R+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+
0

1
R+
13
L-R-L-L-L-L-R-R-R-R-L+R+L+

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to achieve this transformation.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: For each segment transformation, we can perform operations to adjust the left and right borders. The operations are:
   - `L+`: Increase the left border by 1.
   - `L-`: Decrease the left border by 1.
   - `R+`: Increase the right border by 1.
   - `R-`: Decrease the right border by 1.

2. **Transformation Strategy**: For each segment transformation from `[Li, Ri]` to `[Li+1, Ri+1]`:
   - Calculate the difference in the left borders (`delta_L = Li+1 - Li`).
   - Calculate the difference in the right borders (`delta_R = Ri+1 - Ri`).
   - Use the operations to adjust the borders:
     - If `delta_L > 0`, perform `L+` operations.
     - If `delta_L < 0`, perform `L-` operations.
     - If `delta_R > 0`, perform `R+` operations.
     - If `delta_R < 0`, perform `R-` operations.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: Start from the first segment and apply the necessary operations to transform it into the next segment, continuing until the last segment is reached.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i+1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L
            elif delta_L < 0:
                operations += "L-" * (-delta_L)
            if delta_R > 0:
                operations += "R+" * delta_R
            elif delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)
        results.append((total_operations, operations))
    return results

# Read input and process each test case
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i in range(N - 1):
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            if delta_L > 0:

            elif delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)
        results.append((total_operations, operations))

# Process each test case
results = transform_segments(T, test_cases)

# Output results
for result in results:

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **transform_segments Function**: This function processes each test case by iterating through the segments and calculating the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one. It accumulates the total number of operations and constructs the sequence of operations.
- **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. The operations must be lexicographically minimal when multiple sequences have the same number of operations.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The current solution does not correctly handle the lexicographical order of operations. The order should be `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`, but the solution does not ensure this order when applying operations.

2. **Output Format**: The solution does not correctly handle the output format, especially when there are no operations needed (e.g., when the segments are already the same).

3. **Logic for Operations**: The logic for applying operations might not be correctly implemented to ensure the minimal number of operations and the correct order.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Lexicographical Order**: When applying operations, ensure that `L+` and `L-` are applied before `R+` and `R-` if they result in the same number of operations.

2. **Handle No Operations Case**: If no operations are needed, ensure the output is correctly formatted with zero operations and an empty sequence.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Re-evaluate the logic for calculating the number of operations and ensure that the operations are applied in the correct order.

### Revised Solution

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i in range(N - 1):
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            
            # Apply L+ and L- first for lexicographical order
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L
            elif delta_L < 0:
                operations += "L-" * (-delta_L)

            elif delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. The operations must be lexicographically minimal when multiple sequences have the same number of operations.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The current solution does not correctly handle the lexicographical order of operations. The order should be `R+`, `L+`, `R-`, `L-`, but the solution does not ensure this order when applying operations.

2. **Output Format**: The solution does not correctly handle the output format, especially when there are no operations needed (e.g., when the segments are already the same).

3. **Logic for Operations**: The logic for applying operations might not be correctly implemented to ensure the minimal number of operations and the correct order.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Lexicographical Order**: When applying operations, ensure that `R+` and `L+` are applied before `R-` and `L-` if they result in the same number of operations.

2. **Handle No Operations Case**: If no operations are needed, ensure the output is correctly formatted with zero operations and an empty sequence.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Re-evaluate the logic for calculating the number of operations and ensure that the operations are applied in the correct order.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:

-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to achieve this transformation.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: For each segment transformation, we can perform operations to adjust the left and right borders. The operations are:
   - `L+`: Increase the left border by 1.
   - `L-`: Decrease the left border by 1.
   - `R+`: Increase the right border by 1.
   - `R-`: Decrease the right border by 1.

2. **Transformation Strategy**: For each segment transformation from `[Li, Ri]` to `[Li+1, Ri+1]`:
   - Calculate the difference in the left borders (`delta_L = Li+1 - Li`).
   - Calculate the difference in the right borders (`delta_R = Ri+1 - Ri`).
   - Use the operations to adjust the borders:
     - If `delta_L > 0`, perform `L+` operations.
     - If `delta_L < 0`, perform `L-` operations.
     - If `delta_R > 0`, perform `R+` operations.
     - If `delta_R < 0`, perform `R-` operations.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: Start from the first segment and apply the necessary operations to transform it into the next segment, continuing until the last segment is reached.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []

### Explanation of the Code

- **transform_segments Function**: This function processes each test case by iterating through the segments and calculating the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one. It accumulates the total number of operations and constructs the sequence of operations.
- **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. The operations must be lexicographically minimal when multiple sequences have the same number of operations.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The current solution does not correctly handle the lexicographical order of operations. The order should be `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`, but the solution does not ensure this order when applying operations.

2. **Output Format**: The solution does not correctly handle the output format, especially when there are no operations needed (e.g., when the segments are already the same).

3. **Logic for Operations**: The logic for applying operations might not be correctly implemented to ensure the minimal number of operations and the correct order.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Lexicographical Order**: When applying operations, ensure that `L+` and `L-` are applied before `R+` and `R-` if they result in the same number of operations.

2. **Handle No Operations Case**: If no operations are needed, ensure the output is correctly formatted with zero operations and an empty sequence.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Re-evaluate the logic for calculating the number of operations and ensure that the operations are applied in the correct order.

### Revised Solution

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i in range(N - 1):
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            
            # Apply L+ and L- first for lexicographical order

            elif delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)

# Process each test case

        You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

        Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

        -----Input-----
        The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
        The second line contains the string S.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
        - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
        - S will consist of uppercase English letters.

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        2
        4
        DCBA
        7
        XYZZYZZ

        Output:
        ADCB
        XYYZZZZ

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
        Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a string consisting of uppercase English letters. We are allowed to perform at most one operation where we can remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our task is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we need to consider the following:

        1. **Identify the smallest character**: We should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible.
        2. **Positioning**: If the smallest character is not already at the beginning, we should move it to the start. If it is already at the start, we should look for the next smallest character that can be moved to improve the order.
        3. **Iterate through the string**: For each character, check if moving it to the start or another position can result in a smaller string.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
            smallest_string = S
            for i from 0 to length of S - 1:
                for j from 0 to length of S - 1:
                    if i != j:
                        # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j
                        new_string = S with character at i removed and inserted at j
                        if new_string is lexicographically smaller than smallest_string:
                            smallest_string = new_string
            return smallest_string

        function process_test_cases(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, S = test_case
                result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)
                add result to results
            return results
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
            smallest_string = S
            N = len(S)
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(N):
                    if i != j:
                        # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j
                        new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]
                        new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]
                        if new_string < smallest_string:
                            smallest_string = new_string
            return smallest_string

                result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)
                results.append(result)
            return results

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().strip().split()

        # First line is the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            S = data[index + 1]
            test_cases.append((N, S))
            index += 2

        # Process each test case
        results = process_test_cases(T, test_cases)

        # Output results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **find_lexicographically_smallest_string Function**: This function iterates over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. It checks if the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the current smallest string found.
        - **process_test_cases Function**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` for each test case and collecting the results.
        - **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing at most one operation of removing a character from any position in the string and inserting it back at any other position. The key concept here was to leverage the ability to reposition characters to achieve a smaller lexicographical order.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Lexicographical Order**: Understanding how strings are compared based on character order was crucial. The task was essentially about rearranging characters to achieve the smallest possible order.
    - **Character Repositioning**: The problem allowed for one character to be moved, which meant exploring all possible single-character moves to find the optimal configuration.

    ### Strategy
    The strategy involved iterating over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. This brute-force approach was feasible given the constraints (maximum string length of 50 and up to 50 test cases).

    ### Code Snippet
    The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` was central to the solution. It iterated over all possible character moves and checked if the resulting string was smaller than the current smallest found:

    ```python
    def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
        smallest_string = S
        N = len(S)
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if i != j:
                    new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]
                    new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]
                    if new_string < smallest_string:
                        smallest_string = new_string
        return smallest_string
    ```

    ### Outcome
    The solution was effective and passed all test cases. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and lexicographical order, as well as the utility of brute-force approaches when constraints are manageable.

- **Output Handling**: The code correctly handles cases where no operations are needed by ensuring the output is formatted correctly.
- **Logic Correction**: The logic for calculating and applying operations is re-evaluated to ensure correctness. The operations are accumulated in a string, and the total number of operations is counted.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to achieve this transformation.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: For each segment transformation, we can perform operations to adjust the left and right borders. The operations are:
   - `L+`: Increase the left border by 1.
   - `L-`: Decrease the left border by 1.
   - `R+`: Increase the right border by 1.
   - `R-`: Decrease the right border by 1.

2. **Transformation Strategy**: For each segment transformation from `[Li, Ri]` to `[Li+1, Ri+1]`:
   - Calculate the difference in the left borders (`delta_L = Li+1 - Li`).
   - Calculate the difference in the right borders (`delta_R = Ri+1 - Ri`).
   - Use the operations to adjust the borders:
     - If `delta_L > 0`, perform `L+` operations.
     - If `delta_L < 0`, perform `L-` operations.
     - If `delta_R > 0`, perform `R+` operations.
     - If `delta_R < 0`, perform `R-` operations.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: Start from the first segment and apply the necessary operations to transform it into the next segment, continuing until the last segment is reached.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i+1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L
            elif delta_L < 0:
                operations += "L-" * (-delta_L)
            if delta_R > 0:
                operations += "R+" * delta_R
            elif delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)
        results.append((total_operations, operations))
    return results

# Read input and process each test case
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i in range(N - 1):
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L

                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)
        results.append((total_operations, operations))
    return results

# Read input

    N = int(data[index])
    segments = []
    for _ in range(N):
        L, R = map(int, data[index + 1:index + 3])
        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append((N, segments))

# Process each test case
results = transform_segments(T, test_cases)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result[0])
    print(result[1])
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **transform_segments Function**: This function processes each test case by iterating through the segments and calculating the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one. It accumulates the total number of operations and constructs the sequence of operations.
- **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. The operations must be lexicographically minimal when multiple sequences have the same number of operations.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The current solution does not correctly handle the lexicographical order of operations. The order should be `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`, but the solution does not ensure this order when applying operations.

2. **Output Format**: The solution does not correctly handle the output format, especially when there are no operations needed (e.g., when the segments are already the same).

3. **Logic for Operations**: The logic for applying operations might not be correctly implemented to ensure the minimal number of operations and the correct order.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Lexicographical Order**: When applying operations, ensure that `L+` and `L-` are applied before `R+` and `R-` if they result in the same number of operations.

2. **Handle No Operations Case**: If no operations are needed, ensure the output is correctly formatted with zero operations and an empty sequence.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Re-evaluate the logic for calculating the number of operations and ensure that the operations are applied in the correct order.

### Revised Solution

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""

            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            
            # Apply L+ and L- first for lexicographical order
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L
            elif delta_L < 0:
                operations += "L-" * (-delta_L)

            if delta_R > 0:
                operations += "R+" * delta_R
            elif delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Segment Transformation Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem revolves around transforming a sequence of segments using a minimal number of operations while ensuring the operations are lexicographically minimal. The operations allowed are shifting the left or right border of a segment by one unit, either increasing or decreasing it. The challenge is to apply these operations in the correct order to achieve the desired transformation efficiently.

#### Strategies and Challenges
Initially, the strategy was to calculate the difference between the borders of consecutive segments and apply the necessary operations. However, the key challenge was ensuring the operations were applied in the correct lexicographical order. The correct order is `R+`, `L+`, `R-`, `L-`, which was not initially adhered to, leading to incorrect results.

#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
The main error was in the order of operations, which affected the lexicographical sequence. The solution initially applied operations in a different order, leading to incorrect outputs. By re-evaluating the order and ensuring `R+` and `L+` were applied before `R-` and `L-`, the solution was corrected. Additionally, handling cases with no operations needed was crucial to ensure the output format was correct.

#### Final Solution
The final solution involves iterating through the segments, calculating the necessary operations for each transformation, and applying them in the correct order. The operations are accumulated in a string, and the total number of operations is counted. This approach ensures both minimal and lexicographically correct transformations.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1
1 2

Output:

R+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+
0

13
L-R-L-L-L-L-R-R-R-R-L+R+L+

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to achieve this transformation.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: For each segment transformation, we can perform operations to adjust the left and right borders. The operations are:
   - `L+`: Increase the left border by 1.
   - `L-`: Decrease the left border by 1.
   - `R+`: Increase the right border by 1.
   - `R-`: Decrease the right border by 1.

2. **Transformation Strategy**: For each segment transformation from `[Li, Ri]` to `[Li+1, Ri+1]`:
   - Calculate the difference in the left borders (`delta_L = Li+1 - Li`).
   - Calculate the difference in the right borders (`delta_R = Ri+1 - Ri`).
   - Use the operations to adjust the borders:
     - If `delta_L > 0`, perform `L+` operations.
     - If `delta_L < 0`, perform `L-` operations.
     - If `delta_R > 0`, perform `R+` operations.
     - If `delta_R < 0`, perform `R-` operations.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: Start from the first segment and apply the necessary operations to transform it into the next segment, continuing until the last segment is reached.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i+1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L
            elif delta_L < 0:
                operations += "L-" * (-delta_L)
            if delta_R > 0:
                operations += "R+" * delta_R
            elif delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)
        results.append((total_operations, operations))
    return results

# Read input and process each test case
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""

### Explanation of the Code

- **transform_segments Function**: This function processes each test case by iterating through the segments and calculating the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one. It accumulates the total number of operations and constructs the sequence of operations.
- **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. The operations must be lexicographically minimal when multiple sequences have the same number of operations.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The current solution does not correctly handle the lexicographical order of operations. The order should be `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`, but the solution does not ensure this order when applying operations.

2. **Output Format**: The solution does not correctly handle the output format, especially when there are no operations needed (e.g., when the segments are already the same).

3. **Logic for Operations**: The logic for applying operations might not be correctly implemented to ensure the minimal number of operations and the correct order.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Lexicographical Order**: When applying operations, ensure that `L+` and `L-` are applied before `R+` and `R-` if they result in the same number of operations.

2. **Handle No Operations Case**: If no operations are needed, ensure the output is correctly formatted with zero operations and an empty sequence.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Re-evaluate the logic for calculating the number of operations and ensure that the operations are applied in the correct order.

### Revised Solution

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""

            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. The operations must be lexicographically minimal when multiple sequences have the same number of operations.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The current solution does not correctly handle the lexicographical order of operations. The order should be `R+`, `L+`, `R-`, `L-`, but the solution does not ensure this order when applying operations.

2. **Output Format**: The solution does not correctly handle the output format, especially when there are no operations needed (e.g., when the segments are already the same).

3. **Logic for Operations**: The logic for applying operations might not be correctly implemented to ensure the minimal number of operations and the correct order.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Lexicographical Order**: When applying operations, ensure that `R+` and `L+` are applied before `R-` and `L-` if they result in the same number of operations.

2. **Handle No Operations Case**: If no operations are needed, ensure the output is correctly formatted with zero operations and an empty sequence.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Re-evaluate the logic for calculating the number of operations and ensure that the operations are applied in the correct order.

### Revised Solution

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = ""
        total_operations = 0
        for i in range(N - 1):
            L1, R1 = segments[i]
            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]
            delta_L = L2 - L1
            delta_R = R2 - R1
            
            # Apply R+ and L+ first for lexicographical order
            if delta_R > 0:
                operations += "R+" * delta_R
            if delta_L > 0:
                operations += "L+" * delta_L
            
            # Apply R- and L- after R+ and L+ operations
            if delta_R < 0:
                operations += "R-" * (-delta_R)
            if delta_L < 0:
                operations += "L-" * (-delta_L)
            
            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)
        
        results.append((total_operations, operations))
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    segments = []
    for _ in range(N):
        L, R = map(int, data[index + 1:index + 3])
        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append((N, segments))

# Process each test case
results = transform_segments(T, test_cases)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result[0])
    print(result[1])
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Lexicographical Order**: The operations `R+` and `L+` are applied before `R-` and `L-` to ensure the lexicographically smallest sequence.
- **Output Handling**: The code correctly handles cases where no operations are needed by ensuring the output is formatted correctly.
- **Logic Correction**: The logic for calculating and applying operations is re-evaluated to ensure correctness. The operations are accumulated in a string, and the total number of operations is counted.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

 pr = []

 # 'L' is lexicographically lower than 'R'.
 # so, we should first try to apply L+ or L-

  #continue the following process until a == l and b == r
  while a != l or b != r:

    pr.append('L+')

   # ok, so far, so good... now, let's try to apply R+
   elif b < r:
    b += 1
    pr.append('R+')

   # finally, lastly, trying to apply R- (if a < b)

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem and Solution

The problem involves transforming a sequence of segments using a minimal number of operations while ensuring the operations are lexicographically minimal. My initial attempts failed to pass the test cases due to incorrect handling of the lexicographical order and the sequence of operations.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The official solution emphasizes the importance of applying operations in a specific order to achieve the lexicographically smallest sequence. The order is `L-`, `L+`, `R+`, `R-`. This order ensures that operations on the left border are prioritized over the right border, and increments are prioritized over decrements when possible.

2. **Iterative Approach**: The solution uses a while loop to iteratively adjust the segment borders until they match the target segment. This approach ensures that each operation is applied only when necessary, minimizing the total number of operations.

3. **Condition Checks**: The solution includes specific condition checks to ensure that operations do not result in an invalid segment (e.g., `a < b` must hold true). This prevents the segment from becoming empty, which is a constraint of the problem.

4. **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles each segment transformation in a step-by-step manner, ensuring that the operations are both minimal and correctly ordered.

#### Lessons Learned:

- **Order of Operations**: Understanding the correct order of operations is crucial in problems where lexicographical order matters. Prioritizing certain operations can lead to a more optimal solution.
  
- **Iterative Adjustment**: Using a loop to iteratively adjust values until a condition is met can be more effective than trying to calculate the exact number of operations upfront.

- **Condition Handling**: Carefully handling conditions to prevent invalid states (such as empty segments) is essential in problems with constraints.

In future problems, I will pay closer attention to the order of operations and consider iterative approaches when transformations are involved. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding both the problem constraints and the desired output format.
