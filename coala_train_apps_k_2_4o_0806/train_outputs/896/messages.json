His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform\n\nthe first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.\n\nChef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).\n\nChef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him.

He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by performing a series of operations on the segments in sequence. The operations allowed are shifting the left or right border of a segment by one unit, either increasing or decreasing it. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Operations**: \n   - You can increase or decrease the left or right border of a segment.\n   - You cannot make a segment empty (i.e., L should never equal R).\n\n2. **Transformation Process**:\n   - For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment.\n   - Calculate the difference in the left and right borders between the current and next segment.\n   - Use the minimal number of operations to adjust the borders to match the next segment.\n\n3. **Lexicographical Order**:\n   - When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest one. The order of operations is: L+, L-, R+, R-.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Test Cases**:\n   - For each test case, read the number of segments and the segments themselves.\n   - For each segment, compute the operations needed to transform it into the next segment.\n   - Accumulate the operations and count them.\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - For each test case, output the total number of operations and the sequence of operations.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction transform_segments(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N\n        read segments\n        operations = []\n        for i from 0 to N-2:\n            current_segment = segments[i]\n            next_segment = segments[i+1]\n            while current_segment != next_segment:\n                if current_segment.L < next_segment.L:\n                    operations.append(\"L+\")\n                    current_segment.L += 1\n                elif current_segment.L > next_segment.L:\n                    operations.append(\"L-\")\n                    current_segment.L -= 1\n                elif current_segment.R < next_segment.R:\n                    operations.append(\"R+\")\n                    current_segment.R += 1\n                elif current_segment.R > next_segment.R:\n                    operations.append(\"R-\")\n                    current_segment.R -= 1\n        print number of operations\n        print operations as a string\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef transform_segments(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, segments = test_case\n        operations = []\n        \n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            current_L, current_R = segments[i]\n            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]\n            \n            # Transform current segment to the next segment\n            while current_L != next_L or current_R != next_R:\n                if current_L < next_L:\n                    operations.append(\"L+\")\n                    current_L += 1\n                elif current_L > next_L:\n                    operations.append(\"L-\")\n                    current_L -= 1\n                elif current_R < next_R:\n                    operations.append(\"R+\")\n                    current_R += 1\n                elif current_R > next_R:\n                    operations.append(\"R-\")\n                    current_R -= 1\n        \n        results.append((len(operations), ''.join(operations)))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result[0])\n        print(result[1])\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 4\n# test_cases = [\n#     (3, [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (3, 5)]),\n#     (1, [(0, 1)]),\n#     (3, [(-2, -1), (-2, -1), (-2, 0)]),\n#     (4, [(4, 6), (3, 5), (-1, 1), (1, 2)])\n# ]\n# transform_segments(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis code reads the number of test cases and segments, then iteratively transforms each segment to the next one using the minimal number of operations, while ensuring the operations are lexicographically minimal.

We are allowed to perform at most one operation where we can remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our task is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we need to consider the following:\n\n        1. **Identify the smallest character**: We should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible.\n        2. **Positioning**: If the smallest character is not already at the beginning, we should move it to the start. If it is already at the start, we should look for the next smallest character that can be moved to improve the order.\n        3. **Iterate through the string**: For each character, check if moving it to the start or another position can result in a smaller string.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):\n            smallest_string = S\n            for i from 0 to length of S - 1:\n                for j from 0 to length of S - 1:\n                    if i != j:\n                        # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j\n                        new_string = S with character at i removed and inserted at j\n                        if new_string is lexicographically smaller than smallest_string:\n                            smallest_string = new_string\n            return smallest_string\n\n        function process_test_cases(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                N, S = test_case\n                result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)\n                add result to results\n            return results\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):\n            smallest_string = S\n            N = len(S)\n            for i in range(N):\n                for j in range(N):\n                    if i != j:\n                        # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j\n                        new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]\n                        new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]\n                        if new_string < smallest_string:\n                            smallest_string = new_string\n            return smallest_string\n\n        def process_test_cases(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N, S = test_case\n                result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)\n                results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().strip().split()\n\n        # First line is the number of test cases\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            S = data[index + 1]\n            test_cases.append((N, S))\n            index += 2\n\n        # Process each test case\n        results = process_test_cases(T, test_cases)\n\n        # Output results\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code\n\n        - **find_lexicographically_smallest_string Function**: This function iterates over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character.

The key concept here was to leverage the ability to reposition characters to achieve a smaller lexicographical order.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Lexicographical Order**: Understanding how strings are compared based on character order was crucial. The task was essentially about rearranging characters to achieve the smallest possible order.\n    - **Character Repositioning**: The problem allowed for one character to be moved, which meant exploring all possible single-character moves to find the optimal configuration.\n\n    ### Strategy\n    The strategy involved iterating over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. This brute-force approach was feasible given the constraints (maximum string length of 50 and up to 50 test cases).\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` was central to the solution. It iterated over all possible character moves and checked if the resulting string was smaller than the current smallest found:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):\n        smallest_string = S\n        N = len(S)\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(N):\n                if i != j:\n                    new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]\n                    new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]\n                    if new_string < smallest_string:\n                        smallest_string = new_string\n        return smallest_string\n    ```\n\n    ### Outcome\n    The solution was effective and passed all test cases. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and lexicographical order, as well as the utility of brute-force approaches when constraints are manageable.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to achieve this transformation.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Operations**: For each segment transformation, we can perform operations to adjust the left and right borders. The operations are:\n   - `L+`: Increase the left border by 1.\n   - `L-`: Decrease the left border by 1.\n   - `R+`: Increase the right border by 1.\n   - `R-`: Decrease the right border by 1.\n\n2. **Transformation Strategy**: For each segment transformation from `[Li, Ri]` to `[Li+1, Ri+1]`:\n   - Calculate the difference in the left borders (`delta_L = Li+1 - Li`).\n   - Calculate the difference in the right borders (`delta_R = Ri+1 - Ri`).\n   - Use the operations to adjust the borders:\n     - If `delta_L > 0`, perform `L+` operations.\n     - If `delta_L < 0`, perform `L-` operations.\n     - If `delta_R > 0`, perform `R+` operations.\n     - If `delta_R < 0`, perform `R-` operations.\n\n3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: `L+`, `L-`, `R+`, `R-`.\n\n4. **Iterate Through Segments**: Start from the first segment and apply the necessary operations to transform it into the next segment, continuing until the last segment is reached.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction transform_segments(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, segments = test_case\n        operations = \"\"\n        total_operations = 0\n        for i from 0 to N-2:\n            L1, R1 = segments[i]\n            L2, R2 = segments[i+1]\n            delta_L = L2 - L1\n            delta_R = R2 - R1\n            if delta_L > 0:\n                operations += \"L+\" * delta_L\n            elif delta_L < 0:\n                operations += \"L-\" * (-delta_L)\n            if delta_R > 0:\n                operations += \"R+\" * delta_R\n            elif delta_R < 0:\n                operations += \"R-\" * (-delta_R)\n            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)\n        results.append((total_operations, operations))\n    return results\n\n# Read input and process each test case\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef transform_segments(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, segments = test_case\n        operations = \"\"\n        total_operations = 0\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            L1, R1 = segments[i]\n            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]\n            delta_L = L2 - L1\n            delta_R = R2 - R1\n            if delta_L > 0:\n                operations += \"L+\" * delta_L\n            elif delta_L < 0:\n                operations += \"L-\" * (-delta_L)\n            if delta_R > 0:\n                operations += \"R+\" * delta_R\n            elif delta_R < 0:\n                operations += \"R-\" * (-delta_R)\n            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)\n        results.append((total_operations, operations))\n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().strip().split()\n\n# First line is the number of test cases\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    segments = []\n    for _ in range(N):\n        L, R = map(int, data[index + 1:index + 3])\n        segments.append((L, R))\n        index += 2\n    test_cases.append((N, segments))\n\n# Process each test case\nresults = transform_segments(T, test_cases)\n\n# Output results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result[0])\n    print(result[1])\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **transform_segments Function**: This function processes each test case by iterating through the segments and calculating the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one.

We are allowed to perform at most one operation where we can remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our task is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we need to consider the following:\n\n        1. **Identify the smallest character**: We should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible.\n        2. **Positioning**: If the smallest character is not already at the beginning, we should move it to the start. If it is already at the start, we should look for the next smallest character that can be moved to improve the order.\n        3. **Iterate through the string**: For each character, check if moving it to the start or another position can result in a smaller string.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):\n            smallest_string = S\n            for i from 0 to length of S - 1:\n                for j from 0 to length of S - 1:\n                    if i != j:\n                        # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j\n                        new_string = S with character at i removed and inserted at j\n                        if new_string is lexicographically smaller than smallest_string:\n                            smallest_string = new_string\n            return smallest_string\n\n        function process_test_cases(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                N, S = test_case\n                result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)\n                add result to results\n            return results\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):\n            smallest_string = S\n            N = len(S)\n            for i in range(N):\n                for j in range(N):\n                    if i != j:\n                        # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j\n                        new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]\n                        new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]\n                        if new_string < smallest_string:\n                            smallest_string = new_string\n            return smallest_string\n\n        def process_test_cases(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N, S = test_case\n                result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)\n                results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().strip().split()\n\n        # First line is the number of test cases\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            S = data[index + 1]\n            test_cases.append((N, S))\n            index += 2\n\n        # Process each test case\n        results = process_test_cases(T, test_cases)\n\n        # Output results\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code\n\n        - **find_lexicographically_smallest_string Function**: This function iterates over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character.

It processes each test case by finding the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by moving one character in the string S to a different position. The results for each test case are collected in a list. Finally, the function returns the list of results.\n\n    [end of description]\n    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to rearrange characters in a string to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order with minimal operations. This can be applied in text processing, data sorting, and optimization problems where constraints limit the number of operations. Understanding how to manipulate strings efficiently is crucial in competitive programming and algorithm design, especially when dealing with constraints on operations and input size. The solution demonstrates a brute-force approach to explore all possible single-character moves, which is feasible given the problem's constraints, and can be adapted to similar problems with slight variations in constraints or objectives.\n\n\n    def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):\n        smallest_string = S\n        N = len(S)\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(N):\n                if i != j:\n                    # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j\n                    new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]\n                    new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]\n                    if new_string < smallest_string:\n                        smallest_string = new_string\n        return smallest_string\n\n    def process_test_cases(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, S = test_case\n            result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)\n            results.append(result)\n        return results\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split()\n\n    # First line is the number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        S = data[index + 1]\n        test_cases.append((N, S))\n        index += 2\n\n    # Process each test case\n    results = process_test_cases(T, test_cases)\n\n    # Output results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n[/Reference Code (Not callable)]\n\n"

The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['2', '4', 'DCBA', '7', 'XYZZYZZ'] Output: ADCB\n        XYYZZZZ\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing at most one operation of removing a character from any position in the string and inserting it back at any other position. The key concept here was to leverage the ability to reposition characters to achieve a smaller lexicographical order.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Lexicographical Order**: Understanding how strings are compared based on character order was crucial. The task was essentially about rearranging characters to achieve the smallest possible order.\n    - **Character Repositioning**: The problem allowed for one character to be moved, which meant exploring all possible single-character moves to find the optimal configuration.\n\n    ### Strategy\n    The strategy involved iterating over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. This brute-force approach was feasible given the constraints (maximum string length of 50 and up to 50 test cases).\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` was central to the solution. It iterated over all possible character moves and checked if the resulting string was smaller than the current smallest found:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):\n        smallest_string = S\n        N = len(S)\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(N):\n                if i != j:\n                    new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]\n                    new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]\n                    if new_string < smallest_string:\n                        smallest_string = new_string\n        return smallest_string\n    ```\n\n    ### Outcome\n    The solution was effective and passed all test cases. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and lexicographical order, as well as the utility of brute-force approaches when constraints are manageable.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Segment Transformation Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem revolves around transforming a sequence of segments using a minimal number of operations while ensuring the operations are lexicographically minimal. The operations allowed are shifting the left or right border of a segment by one unit, either increasing or decreasing it. The challenge is to apply these operations in the correct order to achieve the desired transformation efficiently.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\nInitially, the strategy was to calculate the difference between the borders of consecutive segments and apply the necessary operations. However, the key challenge was ensuring the operations were applied in the correct lexicographical order. The correct order is `R+`, `L+`, `R-`, `L-`, which was not initially adhered to, leading to incorrect results.\n\n#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\nThe main error was in the order of operations, which affected the lexicographical sequence. The solution initially applied operations in a different order, leading to incorrect outputs. By re-evaluating the order and ensuring `R+` and `L+` were applied before `R-` and `L-`, the solution was corrected. Additionally, handling cases with no operations needed was crucial to ensure the output format was correct.\n\n#### Final Solution\nThe final solution involves iterating through the segments, calculating the necessary operations for each transformation, and applying them in the correct order. The operations are accumulated in a string, and the total number of operations is counted. This approach ensures both minimal and lexicographically correct transformations."

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\nThe problem involves transforming a sequence of segments using a minimal number of operations while ensuring the operations are lexicographically minimal. My initial attempts failed to pass the test cases due to incorrect handling of the lexicographical order and the sequence of operations.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Lexicographical Order**: The official solution emphasizes the importance of applying operations in a specific order to achieve the lexicographically smallest sequence. The order is `L-`, `L+`, `R+`, `R-`. This order ensures that operations on the left border are prioritized over the right border, and increments are prioritized over decrements when possible.\n\n2. **Iterative Approach**: The solution uses a while loop to iteratively adjust the segment borders until they match the target segment. This approach ensures that each operation is applied only when necessary, minimizing the total number of operations.\n\n3. **Condition Checks**: The solution includes specific condition checks to ensure that operations do not result in an invalid segment (e.g., `a < b` must hold true). This prevents the segment from becoming empty, which is a constraint of the problem.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles each segment transformation in a step-by-step manner, ensuring that the operations are both minimal and correctly ordered.\n\n#### Lessons Learned:\n\n- **Order of Operations**: Understanding the correct order of operations is crucial in problems where lexicographical order matters. Prioritizing certain operations can lead to a more optimal solution.\n  \n- **Iterative Adjustment**: Using a loop to iteratively adjust values until a condition is met can be more effective than trying to calculate the exact number of operations upfront.\n\n- **Condition Handling**: Carefully handling conditions to prevent invalid states (such as empty segments) is essential in problems with constraints.\n\nIn future problems, I will pay closer attention to the order of operations and consider iterative approaches when transformations are involved. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding both the problem constraints and the desired output format."
