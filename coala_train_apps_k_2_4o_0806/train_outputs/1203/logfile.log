## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N. For each query, we need to determine how many subsets exist where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number `I` to be at the `K`-th position in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers smaller than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

2. **Remaining Numbers**: After placing `I` at the `K`-th position, the remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the set `{I+1, I+2, ..., N}`. The number of such numbers is `N-I`.

3. **Combinatorial Counting**:
   - Choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers: This is done using combinations, denoted as `C(I-1, K-1)`.
   - Choose any subset of the remaining `N-I` numbers: This is `2^(N-I)` possible subsets.

4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, every calculation should be done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute combinations and powers of 2, precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

### Pseudocode

1. **Precompute Factorials and Inverses**:
   - Compute factorials and their inverses up to the maximum `N` using Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverses.

2. **Process Each Test Case**:
   - For each query `(I, K)`, check if `K-1` is greater than `I-1`. If true, the result is 0 because we can't choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1`.
   - Otherwise, compute the result as `C(I-1, K-1) * 2^(N-I) % MOD`.

3. **Output Results**:
   - Print the result for each query.

### Final Python Solution

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
    factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    inverse_factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    
    for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
        factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD
    
    inverse_factorial[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD - 2, MOD)
    
    for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
        inverse_factorial[i] = inverse_factorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD
    
    return factorial, inverse_factorial

def combination(n, k, factorial, inverse_factorial):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % MOD * inverse_factorial[n - k] % MOD

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    max_n = 4000
    factorial, inverse_factorial = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n)
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        Q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        for _ in range(Q):
            I = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            if K - 1 > I - 1:
                results.append(0)
            else:
                comb = combination(I - 1, K - 1, factorial, inverse_factorial)
                power_of_two = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                result = comb * power_of_two % MOD
                results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by precomputing necessary values and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets for each query.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a sequence of numbers from 1 to N, and we need to find a permutation of these numbers such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair is equal to a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: 
           - For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN), the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair: max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

        2. **Constraints and Observations**:
           - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.
           - The minimum possible value of f(P) is the sum of the smallest N-1 numbers, i.e., 2 + 3 + ... + N.

        3. **Strategy**:
           - Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P) for the given N.
           - If K is greater than this maximum, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.
           - If K is less than the minimum possible value, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.
           - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

        4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
           - Start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible f(P).
           - Adjust the permutation to decrease the sum to K by swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function find_permutation(N, K):
            max_possible = sum of largest N-1 numbers
            min_possible = sum of smallest N-1 numbers
    
            if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:
                return -1
    
            permutation = list of numbers from N to 1 (descending order)
            current_sum = max_possible
    
            for i from 0 to N-2:
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                for j from N-1 down to i+1:
                    if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                        current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                        swap permutation[i] and permutation[j]
                        break
    
            return permutation
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def find_permutation(N, K):
            # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)
            max_possible = sum(range(2, N + 1))
            # Calculate the minimum possible value of f(P)
            min_possible = sum(range(1, N))
    
            if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:
                return -1
    
            # Start with the permutation in descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_possible
    
            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                for j in range(N - 1, i, -1):
                    if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                        current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                        permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]
                        break
    
            return permutation

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                result = find_permutation(N, K)
                if result == -1:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        This solution efficiently calculates the permutation for each test case by starting with the maximum possible sum and adjusting it to match the desired K.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be made to sum to zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns

    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.

    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.

    #### Strategies and Errors

    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.

    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.

    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible():

        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0

        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
        
            sum_A = sum(A)
            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
                k = sum_A // sum_indices
                possible = True
                for i in range(N):
                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):
                        possible = False
                        break
                if possible:
                    results.append("YES")
                else:
                    results.append("NO")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: 
   - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.
   - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.

2. **Constraints**:
   - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.
   - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.

3. **Combinatorial Approach**:
   - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:
     - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.
     - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.
   - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.
   - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):
    MOD = 10^9 + 7
    precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N

    results = []
    for each query (I, K):
        if K > I or K > N:
            results.append(0)
        else:
            count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD
            count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD
            result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD
            results.append(result)
    return results

function precompute_factorials(N):
    factorials = [1] * (N+1)
    inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)
    for i from 2 to N:
        factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD
    inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)
    for i from N-1 down to 1:
        inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD
    return factorials, inverse_factorials

function C(n, k):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

3. **Combinatorial Approach**:
   - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:
     - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.
     - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.
   - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.
   - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to count subsets of a set where a specific element appears at a specific position when the subset is sorted. The challenge was to efficiently compute this for potentially large values of N and Q, given the constraints.

The key strategy involved using combinatorial mathematics, specifically binomial coefficients, to determine the number of ways to choose elements for the subset. The problem required precomputing factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate these coefficients. This approach leveraged the properties of combinations and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the solution was computationally feasible.

One important aspect was ensuring the solution handled edge cases, such as when the desired position K was greater than the number of elements I or N, which would result in zero valid subsets. The use of modular arithmetic was crucial to prevent overflow and ensure the results fit within the problem's constraints.

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of precomputation and efficient combinatorial calculations in problems involving large constraints and modular arithmetic. The solution was validated by passing all test cases, confirming the approach was both correct and efficient.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5

Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: 
   - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.
   - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.

2. **Constraints**:
   - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.
   - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.

3. **Combinatorial Approach**:
   - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:
     - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.
     - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.
   - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.
   - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):
    MOD = 10^9 + 7
    precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N

    results = []
    for each query (I, K):
        if K > I or K > N:
            results.append(0)
        else:
            count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD
            count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD
            result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD
            results.append(result)
    return results

function precompute_factorials(N):
    factorials = [1] * (N+1)
    inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)
    for i from 2 to N:
        factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD
    inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)
    for i from N-1 down to 1:
        inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD
    return factorials, inverse_factorials

function C(n, k):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] The problem of finding subsets where a specific number `I` appears at position `K` in a sorted subset is a combinatorial challenge. The official solution provides a straightforward approach using factorials and combinatorial mathematics, which is similar to the approach I took, but with some differences in implementation.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - The official solution uses Python's `math.factorial` to compute factorials directly. This is a simple and effective way to handle factorials, especially when the constraints are manageable.

2. **Combinatorial Logic**:
   - The solution calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from the `I-1` elements less than `I` using a loop to compute the binomial coefficient. This is done by iteratively multiplying and dividing to avoid large intermediate values, which is a practical approach to handle large numbers without overflow.

3. **Power of Two**:
   - The number of ways to choose any subset of numbers greater than `I` is calculated as `2^(N-I)`, which is consistent with my approach. This is efficiently computed using exponentiation.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within standard integer limits, which is crucial for large computations.

### Reflection:

- The official solution is insightful in its use of direct factorial computation and iterative calculation of binomial coefficients, which avoids the need for precomputing factorials and inverse factorials. This can be more efficient in terms of space when the number of queries is large but the range of `N` is not too extensive.
- My approach precomputed factorials and inverse factorials to quickly compute binomial coefficients, which is beneficial when `N` is large and many queries are involved. However, the official solution's method of calculating binomial coefficients on-the-fly is a good alternative when memory usage is a concern.
- Both solutions effectively handle the constraints and provide correct results, but the official solution's simplicity in handling factorials and binomial coefficients is a valuable technique to remember for similar problems.
