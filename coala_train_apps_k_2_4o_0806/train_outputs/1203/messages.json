        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N. For each query, we need to determine how many subsets exist where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number `I` to be at the `K`-th position in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers smaller than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.\n\n2. **Remaining Numbers**: After placing `I` at the `K`-th position, the remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the set `{I+1, I+2, ..., N}`. The number of such numbers is `N-I`.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**:\n   - Choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers: This is done using combinations, denoted as `C(I-1, K-1)`.\n   - Choose any subset of the remaining `N-I` numbers: This is `2^(N-I)` possible subsets.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, every calculation should be done modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute combinations and powers of 2, precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. **Precompute Factorials and Inverses**:\n   - Compute factorials and their inverses up to the maximum `N` using Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverses.\n\n2. **Process Each Test Case**:\n   - For each query `(I, K)`, check if `K-1` is greater than `I-1`. If true, the result is 0 because we can't choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1`.\n   - Otherwise, compute the result as `C(I-1, K-1) * 2^(N-I) % MOD`.\n\n3. **Output Results**:\n   - Print the result for each query.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):\n    factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inverse_factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n        factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD\n    \n    inverse_factorial[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):\n        inverse_factorial[i] = inverse_factorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD\n    \n    return factorial, inverse_factorial\n\ndef combination(n, k, factorial, inverse_factorial):\n    if k > n or k < 0:\n        return 0\n    return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % MOD * inverse_factorial[n - k] % MOD\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    max_n = 4000\n    factorial, inverse_factorial = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n)\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        Q = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        for _ in range(Q):\n            I = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            \n            if K - 1 > I - 1:\n                results.append(0)\n            else:\n                comb = combination(I - 1, K - 1, factorial, inverse_factorial)\n                power_of_two = pow(2, N - I, MOD)\n                result = comb * power_of_two % MOD\n                results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the constraints by precomputing necessary values and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets for each query."

The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.\n\n    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.\n\n    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.\n\n    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n        \n            sum_A = sum(A)\n            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                k = sum_A // sum_indices\n                possible = True\n                for i in range(N):\n                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                if possible:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Subsets**: \n   - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.\n   - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.\n   - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Approach**:\n   - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:\n     - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.\n     - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.\n   - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.\n   - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**:\n   - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n    MOD = 10^9 + 7\n    precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N\n\n    results = []\n    for each query (I, K):\n        if K > I or K > N:\n            results.append(0)\n        else:\n            count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD\n            count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD\n            result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n            results.append(result)\n    return results\n\nfunction precompute_factorials(N):\n    factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n    inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n    for i from 2 to N:\n        factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n    inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i from N-1 down to 1:\n        inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n    return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\nfunction C(n, k):\n    if k > n or k < 0:\n        return 0\n    return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n    factorials, inverse_factorials = precompute_factorials(N, MOD)\n    \n    results = []\n    for I, K in queries:\n        if K > I or K > N:\n            results.append(0)\n        else:\n            count_less = C(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD)\n            count_greater = pow(2, N-I, MOD)\n            result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n            results.append(result)\n    return results\n\ndef precompute_factorials(N, MOD):\n    factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n    inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n    for i in range(2, N+1):\n        factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n    inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(N-1, 0, -1):\n        inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n    return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\ndef C(n, k, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD):\n    if k > n or k < 0:\n        return 0\n    return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        Q = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        queries = []\n        for _ in range(Q):\n            I = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            queries.append((I, K))\n        \n        results.extend(calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the number of subsets for each query by precomputing factorials and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets."

        "content": "In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to count subsets of a set where a specific element appears at a specific position when the subset is sorted. The challenge was to efficiently compute this for potentially large values of N and Q, given the constraints.\n\nThe key strategy involved using combinatorial mathematics, specifically binomial coefficients, to determine the number of ways to choose elements for the subset. The problem required precomputing factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate these coefficients. This approach leveraged the properties of combinations and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the solution was computationally feasible.\n\nOne important aspect was ensuring the solution handled edge cases, such as when the desired position K was greater than the number of elements I or N, which would result in zero valid subsets. The use of modular arithmetic was crucial to prevent overflow and ensure the results fit within the problem's constraints.\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of precomputation and efficient combinatorial calculations in problems involving large constraints and modular arithmetic. The solution was validated by passing all test cases, confirming the approach was both correct and efficient."

The official solution provides a straightforward approach using factorials and combinatorial mathematics, which is similar to the approach I took, but with some differences in implementation.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Factorial Calculation**:\n   - The official solution uses Python's `math.factorial` to compute factorials directly. This is a simple and effective way to handle factorials, especially when the constraints are manageable.\n\n2. **Combinatorial Logic**:\n   - The solution calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from the `I-1` elements less than `I` using a loop to compute the binomial coefficient. This is done by iteratively multiplying and dividing to avoid large intermediate values, which is a practical approach to handle large numbers without overflow.\n\n3. **Power of Two**:\n   - The number of ways to choose any subset of numbers greater than `I` is calculated as `2^(N-I)`, which is consistent with my approach. This is efficiently computed using exponentiation.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**:\n   - The result is taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to ensure it fits within standard integer limits, which is crucial for large computations.\n\n### Reflection:\n\n- The official solution is insightful in its use of direct factorial computation and iterative calculation of binomial coefficients, which avoids the need for precomputing factorials and inverse factorials. This can be more efficient in terms of space when the number of queries is large but the range of `N` is not too extensive.\n- My approach precomputed factorials and inverse factorials to quickly compute binomial coefficients, which is beneficial when `N` is large and many queries are involved. However, the official solution's method of calculating binomial coefficients on-the-fly is a good alternative when memory usage is a concern.\n- Both solutions effectively handle the constraints and provide correct results, but the official solution's simplicity in handling factorials and binomial coefficients is a valuable technique to remember for similar problems."

This is particularly relevant in combinatorial problems where subsets need to be generated in a sorted order, and specific elements must occupy certain positions. The solution involves combinatorial mathematics, specifically the use of binomial coefficients and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers. This is applicable in fields like computer science, especially in algorithm design and analysis, where efficient computation of combinatorial structures is required.
