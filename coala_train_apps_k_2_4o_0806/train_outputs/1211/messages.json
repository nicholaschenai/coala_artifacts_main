No string in the array is a substring of another string in the array. The task is to find any valid smallest superstring.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively merge strings by maximizing the overlap between them until we form a single superstring. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n        1. **Calculate Overlaps**: For each pair of strings, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of another.\n\n        2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring. We can use a bitmask to represent the set of strings included in the current superstring and a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each combination of strings.\n\n        3. **Reconstruct the Superstring**: Once the DP table is filled, backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        1. **Initialize Overlap Table**: Create a table `overlap[i][j]` to store the maximum overlap between strings `A[i]` and `A[j]`.\n\n        2. **Fill Overlap Table**: For each pair of strings `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum overlap by checking suffixes of `A[i]` and prefixes of `A[j]`.\n\n        3. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Create a DP table `dp[mask][i]` where `mask` is a bitmask representing the set of strings included, and `i` is the last string in the superstring. Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` with `A[i]`.\n\n        4. **Fill DP Table**: For each `mask` and each `i`, update `dp[mask][i]` by considering adding a new string `j` to the superstring and using the overlap information.\n\n        5. **Reconstruct the Superstring**: Start from the full mask and backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        from typing import List\n\n        class Solution:\n            def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:\n                n = len(A)\n        \n                # Step 1: Calculate the overlap between each pair of strings\n                def calculate_overlap(s1, s2):\n                    max_overlap = 0\n                    for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n                        if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n                            max_overlap = i\n                    return max_overlap\n        \n                overlap = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n                for i in range(n):\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        if i != j:\n                            overlap[i][j] = calculate_overlap(A[i], A[j])\n        \n                # Step 2: Use dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring\n                dp = [[''] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n        \n                for i in range(n):\n                    dp[1 << i][i] = A[i]\n        \n                for mask in range(1 << n):\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        if not (mask & (1 << i)):\n                            continue\n                        for j in range(n):\n                            if mask & (1 << j):\n                                continue\n                            new_mask = mask | (1 << j)\n                            candidate = dp[mask][i] + A[j][overlap[i][j]:]\n                            if dp[new_mask][j] == '' or len(candidate) < len(dp[new_mask][j]):\n                                dp[new_mask][j] = candidate\n        \n                # Step 3: Find the shortest superstring from the dp table\n                min_superstring = ''\n                full_mask = (1 << n) -

**Overlap Calculation**: We calculate the maximum overlap between each pair of strings to determine how much of one string can be appended to another without repeating characters.\n\n        - **Dynamic Programming**: We use a bitmask to represent subsets of strings and a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset ending with a specific string.\n\n        -

$s[2 \\dots 5] = abab$\n    - $s[3 \\dots 6] = baba$\n    - $s[7 \\dots 7] = ee$\n\n    Another example:\n\n    $$abaaba$$\n\n    Here there are only two repetitions\n\n    - $s[0 \\dots 5] = abaaba$\n    - $s[2 \\dots 3] = aa$\n\n    ## Number of repetitions\n\n    In general there can be up to $O(n^2)$ repetitions in a string of length $n$.\n    An obvious example is a string consisting of $n$ times the same letter, in this case any substring of even length is a repetition.\n    In general any periodic string with a short period will contain a lot of repetitions.\n\n    On the other hand this fact does not prevent computing the number of repetitions in $O(n \\log n)$ time, because the algorithm can give the repetitions in compressed form, in groups of several pieces at once.\n\n    There is even the concept, that describes groups of periodic substrings with tuples of size four.\n    It has been proven that we the number of such groups is at most linear with respect to the string length.\n\n    Also, here are some more interesting results related to the number of repetitions:\n\n      - The number of primitive repetitions (those whose halves are not repetitions) is at most $O(n \\log n)$.\n      - If we encode repetitions with tuples of numbers (called Crochemore triples) $(i,~ p,~ r)$ (where $i$ is the position of the beginning, $p$ the length of the repeating substring, and $r$ the number of repetitions), then all repetitions can be described with $O(n \\log n)$ such triples.\n      - Fibonacci strings, defined as \n    \n        \\[\\begin{align}\n        t_0 &= a, \\\\\\\\\n        t_1 &= b, \\\\\\\\\n        t_i &= t_{i-1} + t_{i-2},\n        \\end{align}\\]\n    \n        are \"strongly\" periodic.\n        The number of repetitions in the Fibonacci string $f_i$, even in the compressed with Crochemore triples, is $O(f_n \\log f_n)$.\n        The number of primitive repetitions is also $O(f_n \\log f_n)$.\n\n    ## Main-Lorentz algorithm\n\n    The idea behind the Main-Lorentz algorithm is **divide-and-conquer**.\n\n    It splits the initial string into halves, and computes the number of repetitions that lie completely in each halve by two recursive calls.\n    Then comes the difficult part.\n    The algorithm finds all repetitions starting in the first half and ending in the second half (which we will call **crossing repetitions**).\n    This is the essential part of the Main-Lorentz algorithm, and we will discuss it in detail here.\n\n    The complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms is well researched.\n    The [master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)) says, that we will end up with an $O(n \\log n)$ algorithm, if we can compute the crossing repetitions in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    ### Search for crossing repetitions\n\n    So we want to find all such repetitions that start in the first half of the string, let's call it $u$, and end in the second half, let's call it $v$:\n\n    $$s = u + v$$\n\n    Their lengths are approximately equal to the length of $s$ divided by two.\n\n    Consider an arbitrary repetition and look at the middle character (more precisely the first character of the second half of the repetition).\n    I.e. if the repetition is a substring $s[i \\dots j]$, then the middle character is $(i + j + 1) / 2$.\n\n    We call a repetition **left** or **right** depending on which string this character is located - in the string $u$ or in the string $v$.\n    In other words a string is called left, if the majority of it lies in $u$, otherwise we call it right.\n\n    We will now discuss how to find **all left repetitions**.\n    Finding all right repetitions can be done in the same way.\n\n    Let us denote the length of the left repetition by $2l$ (i.e. each half of the repetition has length $l$).\n    Consider the first character of the repetition falling into the string $v$ (it is at position $|u|$ in the string $s$).\n    It coincides with the character $l$ positions before it, let's denote this position $cntr$.\n\n    We will fixate this position $cntr$, and **look for all repetitions at this position** $cntr$.\n\n    For example:\n\n    $$c ~ \\underset{cntr}{a} ~ c ~ | ~ a ~ d ~ a$$\n\n    The vertical lines divides the two halves.\n    Here we fixated the position $cntr = 1$, and at this position we find the repetition $caca$.\n\n    It is clear, that if we fixate the position $cntr$, we simultaneously fixate the length of the possible repetitions: $l = |u| - cntr$.\n    Once we know how to find these repetitions, we will iterate over all possible values for $cntr$ from $0$ to $|u|-1$, and find all left crossover repetitions of length $l = |u|,~ |u|-1,~ \\dots, 1$.\n\n    ### Criterion for left crossing repetitions\n\n    Now, how can we find all such repetitions for a fixated $cntr$?\n    Keep in mind that there still can be multiple such repetitions.\n\n    Let's again look at a visualization, this time for the repetition $abcabc$:\n\n    $$\\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ \\overbrace{\\underset{cntr}{b} ~ c}^{l_2} ~ \\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ | ~ \\overbrace{b ~ c}^{l_2}$$\n\n    Here we denoted the lengths of the two pieces of the repetition with $l_1$ and $l_2$:\n    $l_1$ is the length of the repetition up to the position $cntr-1$, and $l_2$ is the length of the repetition from $cntr$ to the end of the half of the repetition.\n    We have $2l = l_1 + l_2 + l_1 + l_2$ as the total length of the repetition.\n\n    Let us generate **necessary and sufficient** conditions for such a repetition at position $cntr$ of length $2l = 2(l_1 + l_2) = 2(|u| - cntr)$:\n\n    - Let $k_1$ be the largest number such that the first $k_1$ characters before the position $cntr$ coincide with the last $k_1$ characters in the string $u$:\n  \n    $$\n    u[cntr - k_1 \\dots cntr - 1] = u[|u| - k_1 \\dots |u| - 1]\n    $$\n  \n    - Let $k_2$ be the largest number such that the $k_2$ characters starting at position $cntr$ coincide with the first $k_2$ characters in the string $v$:\n\n    $$  \n      u[cntr \\dots cntr + k_2 - 1] = v[0 \\dots k_2 - 1]\n    $$\n  \n    - Then we have a repetition exactly for any pair $(l_1,~ l_2)$ with\n\n    $$\n      \\begin{align}\n      l_1 &\\le k_1, \\\\\\\\\n      l_2 &\\le k_2. \\\\\\\\\n      \\end{align}\n    $$\n\n    To summarize:\n\n    - We fixate a specific position $cntr$.\n    - All repetition which we will find now have length $2l = 2(|u| - cntr)$.\n      There might be multiple such repetitions, they depend on the lengths $l_1$ and $l_2 = l - l_1$.\n    - We find $k_1$ and $k_2$ as described above.\n    - Then all suitable repetitions are the ones for which the lengths of the pieces $l_1$ and $l_2$ satisfy the conditions:\n\n    $$\n      \\begin{align}\n      l_1 + l_2 &= l = |u| - cntr \\\\\\\\\n      l_1 &\\le k_1, \\\\\\\\\n      l_2 &\\le k_2. \\\\\\\\\n      \\end{align}\n    $$\n\n    Therefore the only remaining part is how we can compute the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ quickly for every position $cntr$.\n    Luckily we can compute them in $O(1)$ using the [Z-function](../string/z-function.md):\n\n    - To can find the value $k_1$ for each position by calculating the Z-function for the string $\\overline{u}$ (i.e. the reversed string $u$).\n      Then the value $k_1$ for a particular $cntr$ will be equal to the corresponding value of the array of the Z-function.\n    - To precompute all values $k_2$, we calculate the Z-function for the string $v + \\# + u$ (i.e. the string $u$ concatenated with the separator character $\\#$ and the string $v$).\n      Again we just need to look up the corresponding value in the Z-function to get the $k_2$ value.\n\n    So this is enough to find all left crossing repetitions.\n\n    ### Right crossing repetitions\n\n    For computing the right crossing repetitions we act similarly:\n    we define the center $cntr$ as the character corresponding to the last character in the string $u$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "In this problem, the core concept was to iteratively remove a specific substring (\"abc\") from a given string until no such substring remains. The challenge was to efficiently handle this operation, especially given the constraints where the string length could be up to 1000 characters.\n\nThe solution leveraged a stack-based approach, which is a common pattern for problems involving removal of consecutive elements based on specific conditions. By using a stack, we could efficiently track and remove the \"abc\" substrings as they appeared. This approach avoids the need for repeatedly scanning the entire string, which would be less efficient.\n\nThe key steps involved:\n1. Iterating through each character of the string.\n2. Using a stack to keep track of characters that are not part of an \"abc\" substring.\n3. Checking the last three characters in the stack to see if they form \"abc\" and removing them if they do.\n4. Constructing the final string from the remaining characters in the stack.\n\nThis method proved to be both simple and effective, as it directly addressed the problem requirements without unnecessary complexity. The solution was implemented successfully and passed all test cases, confirming its correctness and efficiency."

        "content": "The problem of removing consecutive \"abc\" substrings from a string until none remain can be approached in different ways. My initial solution used a stack-based approach, which is efficient and avoids repeatedly scanning the entire string. This method processes each character once and only checks the last three characters in the stack, making it efficient in terms of time complexity.\n\nThe official solution, on the other hand, uses a simpler approach by repeatedly using the `replace` method to remove \"abc\" substrings until none are left. This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be as efficient as the stack-based method for very large strings, since `replace` can potentially scan the entire string multiple times.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n- The use of `replace` in a loop is a simple and direct way to solve the problem, especially when the constraints are manageable.\n- This method is easy to understand and implement, making it a good choice for quick solutions when performance is not a critical concern.\n\nIn summary, both solutions are valid, but the stack-based approach may offer better performance for larger inputs due to its more efficient handling of character processing. The official solution, however, is a good reminder of the power of built-in string methods for straightforward tasks."

        "content": "\n[description for function: process_test_cases]\nThe function takes a list of strings as input, processes each string by removing any occurrence of the substring \"abc\", and returns a list of the modified strings. It iterates over each string in the input list, applies a helper function to remove \"abc\" substrings, and collects the results. The function then returns the list of processed strings, each with all \"abc\" substrings removed.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to iteratively remove specific patterns from a string until no such patterns remain. This is common in text processing tasks, such as cleaning up data, parsing structured text, or implementing custom compression algorithms. The approach of using a stack to efficiently manage and remove patterns can be applied to other problems where you need to track and remove sequences of elements in a list or string. Additionally, this method is useful in competitive programming and coding interviews where you need to solve problems involving string manipulation and pattern matching efficiently."
