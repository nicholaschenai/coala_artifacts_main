INFO - [Task id] 1211 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a string consisting of lowercase English letters. The task is to repeatedly remove any occurrence of the substring "abc" from the string until no such substring remains. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Iterate through each test case**: For each test case, we will process the given string.
2. **Remove "abc" substrings**: Continuously search for the substring "abc" in the string. If found, remove it and check the string again.
3. **Repeat until no "abc" is found**: Continue the removal process until the string no longer contains the substring "abc".
4. **Output the final string**: Once no more "abc" substrings are present, output the resulting string for that test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function remove_abc_pairs(string):
    while "abc" is in string:
        remove the first occurrence of "abc" from string
    return string

function process_test_cases(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        result = remove_abc_pairs(test_case)
        print result

read number of test cases T
initialize an empty list test_cases
for i from 1 to T:
    read a string and append it to test_cases
process_test_cases(test_cases)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def remove_abc_pairs(s):
    # Continuously remove "abc" from the string
    while "abc" in s:
        s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)  # Remove the first occurrence of "abc"
    return s

def process_test_cases(test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        result = remove_abc_pairs(test_case)
        print(result)

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
test_cases = []

# Read each test case
for _ in range(T):
    test_case = input().strip()
    test_cases.append(test_case)

# Process each test case
process_test_cases(test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **remove_abc_pairs**: This function takes a string and repeatedly removes the first occurrence of "abc" until no such substring is found. It uses the `replace` method with a count of 1 to ensure only the first occurrence is removed in each iteration.
  
- **process_test_cases**: This function iterates over each test case, applies the `remove_abc_pairs` function, and prints the result.

- **Main Execution**: The program reads the number of test cases, collects each test case string, and then processes them using the defined functions.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given an array of strings, and we need to find the smallest string that contains each string in the array as a substring. No string in the array is a substring of another string in the array. The task is to find any valid smallest superstring.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively merge strings by maximizing the overlap between them until we form a single superstring. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

        1. **Calculate Overlaps**: For each pair of strings, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of another.

        2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring. We can use a bitmask to represent the set of strings included in the current superstring and a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each combination of strings.

        3. **Reconstruct the Superstring**: Once the DP table is filled, backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.

        ### Pseudocode

        1. **Initialize Overlap Table**: Create a table `overlap[i][j]` to store the maximum overlap between strings `A[i]` and `A[j]`.

        2. **Fill Overlap Table**: For each pair of strings `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum overlap by checking suffixes of `A[i]` and prefixes of `A[j]`.

        3. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Create a DP table `dp[mask][i]` where `mask` is a bitmask representing the set of strings included, and `i` is the last string in the superstring. Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` with `A[i]`.

        4. **Fill DP Table**: For each `mask` and each `i`, update `dp[mask][i]` by considering adding a new string `j` to the superstring and using the overlap information.

        5. **Reconstruct the Superstring**: Start from the full mask and backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        from typing import List

        class Solution:
            def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:
                n = len(A)

                    max_overlap = 0
                    for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):
                        if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:
                            max_overlap = i

                            overlap[i][j] = calculate_overlap(A[i], A[j])

                for i in range(n):
                    dp[1 << i][i] = A[i]
        
                for mask in range(1 << n):
                    for i in range(n):

                            new_mask = mask | (1 << j)
                            candidate = dp[mask][i] + A[j][overlap[i][j]:]
                            if dp[new_mask][j] == '' or len(candidate) < len(dp[new_mask][j]):
                                dp[new_mask][j] = candidate

                for i in range(n):
                    if min_superstring == '' or len(dp[full_mask][i]) < len(min_superstring):
                        min_superstring = dp[full_mask][i]
        
                return min_superstring
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **Overlap Calculation**: We calculate the maximum overlap between each pair of strings to determine how much of one string can be appended to another without repeating characters.

        - **Dynamic Programming**: We use a bitmask to represent subsets of strings and a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset ending with a specific string.

        - **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we find the shortest superstring by checking all possible endings and reconstructing the path that led to it.

    Title: Finding repetitions
    Part: 1/2
    # Finding repetitions

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.

    A **repetition** is two occurrences of a string in a row.
    In other words a repetition can be described by a pair of indices $i < j$ such that the substring $s[i \dots j]$ consists of two identical strings written after each other.

    The challenge is to **find all repetitions** in a given string $s$.
    Or a simplified task: find **any** repetition or find the **longest** repetition.

    The algorithm described here was published in 1982 by Main and Lorentz.

    ## Example

    Consider the repetitions in the following example string:

    $$acababaee$$

    The string contains the following three repetitions:

    - $s[2 \dots 5] = abab$
    - $s[3 \dots 6] = baba$
    - $s[7 \dots 7] = ee$

    Another example:

    $$abaaba$$

    Here there are only two repetitions

    - $s[0 \dots 5] = abaaba$
    - $s[2 \dots 3] = aa$

    ## Number of repetitions

    In general there can be up to $O(n^2)$ repetitions in a string of length $n$.
    An obvious example is a string consisting of $n$ times the same letter, in this case any substring of even length is a repetition.
    In general any periodic string with a short period will contain a lot of repetitions.

    On the other hand this fact does not prevent computing the number of repetitions in $O(n \log n)$ time, because the algorithm can give the repetitions in compressed form, in groups of several pieces at once.

    There is even the concept, that describes groups of periodic substrings with tuples of size four.
    It has been proven that we the number of such groups is at most linear with respect to the string length.

    Also, here are some more interesting results related to the number of repetitions:

      - The number of primitive repetitions (those whose halves are not repetitions) is at most $O(n \log n)$.
      - If we encode repetitions with tuples of numbers (called Crochemore triples) $(i,~ p,~ r)$ (where $i$ is the position of the beginning, $p$ the length of the repeating substring, and $r$ the number of repetitions), then all repetitions can be described with $O(n \log n)$ such triples.
      - Fibonacci strings, defined as 
    
        \[\begin{align}
        t_0 &= a, \\\\
        t_1 &= b, \\\\
        t_i &= t_{i-1} + t_{i-2},
        \end{align}\]
    
        are "strongly" periodic.
        The number of repetitions in the Fibonacci string $f_i$, even in the compressed with Crochemore triples, is $O(f_n \log f_n)$.
        The number of primitive repetitions is also $O(f_n \log f_n)$.

    ## Main-Lorentz algorithm

    The idea behind the Main-Lorentz algorithm is **divide-and-conquer**.

    It splits the initial string into halves, and computes the number of repetitions that lie completely in each halve by two recursive calls.
    Then comes the difficult part.
    The algorithm finds all repetitions starting in the first half and ending in the second half (which we will call **crossing repetitions**).
    This is the essential part of the Main-Lorentz algorithm, and we will discuss it in detail here.

    The complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms is well researched.
    The [master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)) says, that we will end up with an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm, if we can compute the crossing repetitions in $O(n)$ time.

    ### Search for crossing repetitions

    So we want to find all such repetitions that start in the first half of the string, let's call it $u$, and end in the second half, let's call it $v$:

    $$s = u + v$$

    Their lengths are approximately equal to the length of $s$ divided by two.

    Consider an arbitrary repetition and look at the middle character (more precisely the first character of the second half of the repetition).
    I.e. if the repetition is a substring $s[i \dots j]$, then the middle character is $(i + j + 1) / 2$.

    We call a repetition **left** or **right** depending on which string this character is located - in the string $u$ or in the string $v$.
    In other words a string is called left, if the majority of it lies in $u$, otherwise we call it right.

    We will now discuss how to find **all left repetitions**.
    Finding all right repetitions can be done in the same way.

    Let us denote the length of the left repetition by $2l$ (i.e. each half of the repetition has length $l$).
    Consider the first character of the repetition falling into the string $v$ (it is at position $|u|$ in the string $s$).
    It coincides with the character $l$ positions before it, let's denote this position $cntr$.

    We will fixate this position $cntr$, and **look for all repetitions at this position** $cntr$.

    For example:

    $$c ~ \underset{cntr}{a} ~ c ~ | ~ a ~ d ~ a$$

    The vertical lines divides the two halves.
    Here we fixated the position $cntr = 1$, and at this position we find the repetition $caca$.

    It is clear, that if we fixate the position $cntr$, we simultaneously fixate the length of the possible repetitions: $l = |u| - cntr$.
    Once we know how to find these repetitions, we will iterate over all possible values for $cntr$ from $0$ to $|u|-1$, and find all left crossover repetitions of length $l = |u|,~ |u|-1,~ \dots, 1$.

    ### Criterion for left crossing repetitions

    Now, how can we find all such repetitions for a fixated $cntr$?
    Keep in mind that there still can be multiple such repetitions.

    Let's again look at a visualization, this time for the repetition $abcabc$:

    $$\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ \overbrace{\underset{cntr}{b} ~ c}^{l_2} ~ \overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ | ~ \overbrace{b ~ c}^{l_2}$$

    Here we denoted the lengths of the two pieces of the repetition with $l_1$ and $l_2$:
    $l_1$ is the length of the repetition up to the position $cntr-1$, and $l_2$ is the length of the repetition from $cntr$ to the end of the half of the repetition.
    We have $2l = l_1 + l_2 + l_1 + l_2$ as the total length of the repetition.

    Let us generate **necessary and sufficient** conditions for such a repetition at position $cntr$ of length $2l = 2(l_1 + l_2) = 2(|u| - cntr)$:

    - Let $k_1$ be the largest number such that the first $k_1$ characters before the position $cntr$ coincide with the last $k_1$ characters in the string $u$:
  
    $$
    u[cntr - k_1 \dots cntr - 1] = u[|u| - k_1 \dots |u| - 1]
    $$
  
    - Let $k_2$ be the largest number such that the $k_2$ characters starting at position $cntr$ coincide with the first $k_2$ characters in the string $v$:

    $$  
      u[cntr \dots cntr + k_2 - 1] = v[0 \dots k_2 - 1]
    $$
  
    - Then we have a repetition exactly for any pair $(l_1,~ l_2)$ with

    $$
      \begin{align}
      l_1 &\le k_1, \\\\
      l_2 &\le k_2. \\\\
      \end{align}
    $$

    To summarize:

    - We fixate a specific position $cntr$.
    - All repetition which we will find now have length $2l = 2(|u| - cntr)$.
      There might be multiple such repetitions, they depend on the lengths $l_1$ and $l_2 = l - l_1$.
    - We find $k_1$ and $k_2$ as described above.
    - Then all suitable repetitions are the ones for which the lengths of the pieces $l_1$ and $l_2$ satisfy the conditions:

    $$
      \begin{align}
      l_1 + l_2 &= l = |u| - cntr \\\\
      l_1 &\le k_1, \\\\
      l_2 &\le k_2. \\\\
      \end{align}
    $$

    Therefore the only remaining part is how we can compute the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ quickly for every position $cntr$.
    Luckily we can compute them in $O(1)$ using the [Z-function](../string/z-function.md):

    - To can find the value $k_1$ for each position by calculating the Z-function for the string $\overline{u}$ (i.e. the reversed string $u$).
      Then the value $k_1$ for a particular $cntr$ will be equal to the corresponding value of the array of the Z-function.
    - To precompute all values $k_2$, we calculate the Z-function for the string $v + \# + u$ (i.e. the string $u$ concatenated with the separator character $\#$ and the string $v$).
      Again we just need to look up the corresponding value in the Z-function to get the $k_2$ value.

    So this is enough to find all left crossing repetitions.

    ### Right crossing repetitions

    For computing the right crossing repetitions we act similarly:
    we define the center $cntr$ as the character corresponding to the last character in the string $u$.

INFO - [Task id] 1211 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a string consisting of lowercase English alphabets. The task is to iteratively remove all occurrences of the substring "abc" from the string until no such substring remains. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to efficiently remove the "abc" substrings:

1. **Iterate through the String**: For each character in the string, we will process it one by one.
2. **Use a Stack**: We will use a stack to keep track of the characters that are not part of an "abc" substring.
3. **Check for "abc"**: As we add each character to the stack, we check if the last three characters in the stack form the substring "abc". If they do, we remove these three characters from the stack.
4. **Repeat Until Done**: Continue this process until we have processed all characters in the string.
5. **Resulting String**: The characters remaining in the stack form the resulting string after all "abc" substrings have been removed.

### Pseudocode

```
function remove_abc(string):
    stack = empty list
    for each character in string:
        add character to stack
        if last three characters in stack form "abc":
            remove last three characters from stack
    return join characters in stack to form the resulting string

    for each test_case in test_cases:
        result = remove_abc(test_case)
        add result to results
    return results
```

INFO - [Task id] 1211 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to iteratively remove a specific substring ("abc") from a given string until no such substring remains. The challenge was to efficiently handle this operation, especially given the constraints where the string length could be up to 1000 characters.

The solution leveraged a stack-based approach, which is a common pattern for problems involving removal of consecutive elements based on specific conditions. By using a stack, we could efficiently track and remove the "abc" substrings as they appeared. This approach avoids the need for repeatedly scanning the entire string, which would be less efficient.

The key steps involved:
1. Iterating through each character of the string.
2. Using a stack to keep track of characters that are not part of an "abc" substring.
3. Checking the last three characters in the stack to see if they form "abc" and removing them if they do.
4. Constructing the final string from the remaining characters in the stack.

This method proved to be both simple and effective, as it directly addressed the problem requirements without unnecessary complexity. The solution was implemented successfully and passed all test cases, confirming its correctness and efficiency.

INFO - [Task id] 1211 [generation text] The problem of removing consecutive "abc" substrings from a string until none remain can be approached in different ways. My initial solution used a stack-based approach, which is efficient and avoids repeatedly scanning the entire string. This method processes each character once and only checks the last three characters in the stack, making it efficient in terms of time complexity.

The official solution, on the other hand, uses a simpler approach by repeatedly using the `replace` method to remove "abc" substrings until none are left. This approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be as efficient as the stack-based method for very large strings, since `replace` can potentially scan the entire string multiple times.

Key insights from the official solution:
- The use of `replace` in a loop is a simple and direct way to solve the problem, especially when the constraints are manageable.
- This method is easy to understand and implement, making it a good choice for quick solutions when performance is not a critical concern.

In summary, both solutions are valid, but the stack-based approach may offer better performance for larger inputs due to its more efficient handling of character processing. The official solution, however, is a good reminder of the power of built-in string methods for straightforward tasks.

INFO - [Task id] 1211 [generation text] The function takes a list of strings as input, processes each string by removing any occurrence of the substring "abc", and returns a list of the modified strings. It iterates over each string in the input list, applies a helper function to remove "abc" substrings, and collects the results. The function then returns the list of processed strings, each with all "abc" substrings removed.

[Problem]
    The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

    -----Constraints:-----
    $T \leq 2 $
    $1 \leq String length \leq 1000 $

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    aabcc
    bababccc

    -----Sample Output:-----
    ac
    bc

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    For 1) after removing "abc" at middle we get a new string as ac.
    For 2) string = bababccc
    newString1 = babcc  // After removing middle "abc"
    newString2 = bc   //After removing "abc"
