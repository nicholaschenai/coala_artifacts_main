## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a mafia organization with a hierarchical structure. Each member reports to exactly one other member, except for the Don, who reports to no one. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom a particular member reports. Our task is to identify all the "minor criminals," which are members that no one reports to. These members are potential killers. We need to output their indices in ascending order.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Don**: The Don is the only member who reports to no one, indicated by a 0 in the list.
2. **Track Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.
3. **Identify Minor Criminals**: A minor criminal is a member who is not in the set of reported members.
4. **Output**: Collect all such minor criminals and output their indices in ascending order.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the integer `N` (number of members).
2. Read the list `R` of size `N` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom member `i+1` reports.
3. Initialize an empty set `reported_to`.
4. Iterate over each `Ri` in `R`:
   - If `Ri` is not 0, add `Ri` to the `reported_to` set.
5. Initialize an empty list `minor_criminals`.
6. Iterate over indices from 1 to `N`:
   - If the index is not in `reported_to`, add it to `minor_criminals`.
7. Sort `minor_criminals`.
8. Print the sorted list of `minor_criminals`.

### Python Code

```python
def find_potential_killers():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    # Set to track members who are reported to
    reported_to = set()
    
    # Fill the set with members who are reported to
    for Ri in R:
        if Ri != 0:
            reported_to.add(Ri)
    
    # List to store potential killers (minor criminals)
    minor_criminals = []
    
    # Check each member if they are not reported to
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to:
            minor_criminals.append(i)
    
    # Sort the list of minor criminals
    minor_criminals.sort()
    
    # Print the result
    print(" ".join(map(str, minor_criminals)))

```

This code reads input, processes the reporting structure to identify members who are not reported to by anyone, and outputs their indices in ascending order.

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called, which is a common issue when the function is defined but not executed. In competitive programming or script-based environments, the main function or logic should be executed directly to ensure the program runs as expected.

        ### Steps to Fix the Code

        1. **Ensure Execution**: The `solve()` function should be called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed when the script runs.

        2. **Check Input/Output**: Ensure that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()` which is appropriate for reading all input at once in a competitive programming environment.

        3. **Verify Logic**: The logic for calculating the LCM and determining the number of times all groups are on campus together seems correct, but we should ensure that the function is executed to see the results.

        ### Revised Python Code

        ```python
        def gcd(a, b):
            while b:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a

        def lcm(a, b):
            return a * b // gcd(a, b)

        def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                index += 1
                x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])
                index += 3
        
                # Calculate LCM of x, y, z
                lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        
                # Calculate total hours in N days
                total_hours = 24 * N
        
                # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together
                count = total_hours // lcm_xyz
        
                results.append(count)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the solve function to execute the logic
        solve()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes

        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure that the function is executed when the script runs.
        - **Input/Output Handling**: The input and output handling remains the same, using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and `print()` to output results.

        This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function will now be executed and produce the expected results.

    [Task]:
        Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
        He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
        21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
        Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
        12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
        Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
        12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
        Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

        -----Input:-----
        The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

        -----Output:-----
        A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

        -----Constraints:-----
        - $1 \leq N \leq 200000$.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are not in order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can leverage the concept of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). The idea is that the books that are already in the correct order form an increasing subsequence. The minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of this longest increasing subsequence. This is because the books that are not part of the LIS need to be moved to achieve the sorted order.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Function findLISLength(arr):
               Initialize an empty list 'lis'
               For each book in arr:
                   If lis is empty or book is greater than the last element in lis:
                       Append book to lis
                   Else:
                       Find the position in lis where book should be placed to maintain sorted order
                       Replace the element at that position with book
               Return the length of lis

           Function minMovesToSortBooks(N, books):
               lis_length = findLISLength(books)
               Return N - lis_length
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        def findLISLength(arr):
            # This function finds the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
            # using a binary search approach for efficiency.
            lis = []
            for book in arr:
                # If lis is empty or the current book is greater than the last element in lis
                if not lis or book > lis[-1]:
                    lis.append(book)

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia has a hierarchical structure with one Don at the top, and each member reports to exactly one other member. The Don reports to no one. A potential killer is defined as a minor criminal, which means they are members who nobody reports to. Given the reporting structure, we need to find all such members.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Understanding**: We have `N` members, and each member `i` reports to `Ri`. The Don is the only member with `Ri = 0`.

2. **Output Requirement**: We need to output the indices of members who are potential killers, i.e., those who are not reported to by any other member.

3. **Approach**:
   - Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to.
   - Iterate over the list of reports `R` and add each `Ri` (except 0) to this set.
   - The potential killers are those members whose indices are not in this set.
   - Output these indices in ascending order.

### Pseudocode

```
function findPotentialKillers(N, R):
    reported_to = set()
    for i from 1 to N:
        if R[i] != 0:
            add R[i] to reported_to
    
    potential_killers = []
    for i from 1 to N:
        if i not in reported_to:
            add i to potential_killers
    
    sort potential_killers
    return potential_killers
```

### Python Code

```python
def findPotentialKillers(N, R):
    # Set to track members who are reported to
    reported_to = set()
    
    # Populate the set with members who are reported to
    for i in range(N):
        if R[i] != 0:
            reported_to.add(R[i])
    
    # List to store potential killers
    potential_killers = []
    
    # Identify members who are not reported to by anyone
    for i in range(1, N + 1):

            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers in ascending order
    potential_killers.sort()
    
    # Return the list of potential killers
    return potential_killers

R = list(map(int, data[1:]))

# Find and print the potential killers
result = findPotentialKillers(N, R)
print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

### Explanation

- We use a set `reported_to` to track all members who are reported to by others.
- We iterate over the reporting list `R` and add each `Ri` to the set, except when `Ri` is 0 (indicating the Don).
- We then check each member from 1 to N to see if they are not in the `reported_to` set, indicating they are potential killers.
- Finally, we sort and print the list of potential killers.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to identify potential killers in a mafia organization based on a hierarchical reporting structure. The key concept was to find members who are not reported to by anyone else, as these are considered minor criminals or potential killers.

The solution involved using a set to track all members who are reported to. By iterating over the reporting list and adding each reported member to the set, we could easily identify those who are not in the set. These members are the potential killers. The final step was to sort and output these members in ascending order.

This problem reinforced the use of sets for efficient membership checking, which is crucial when dealing with large datasets. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging the properties of sets to solve the problem in linear time relative to the number of members, which is optimal given the constraints. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution was effective in identifying potential killers in the mafia hierarchy. However, the official solution offers a different approach that is worth noting for its use of a dictionary to build a tree structure.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Tree Representation**: The official solution uses a dictionary to represent the reporting structure as a tree. Each key in the dictionary is a member, and the value is a list of members who report to that key. This is a clever way to directly map the hierarchy.

2. **Building the Tree**: As the list of reports is processed, the solution checks if a member already has a list of subordinates. If not, it initializes an empty list. This ensures that every member is accounted for in the tree, even if they have no subordinates.

3. **Identifying Potential Killers**: The solution iterates over the dictionary and collects members who have an empty list of subordinates, indicating that no one reports to them. This is an efficient way to identify potential killers.

### Reflection:

- **Efficiency**: Both my solution and the official solution have similar time complexity, but the official solution's use of a dictionary to build a tree structure is a more intuitive representation of the hierarchy. It directly maps the reporting relationships and makes it easy to identify members with no subordinates.

- **Alternative Data Structures**: This problem highlights the importance of choosing the right data structure. While a set was sufficient in my approach, the dictionary-based tree structure provides a more comprehensive view of the hierarchy, which could be beneficial for more complex operations or extensions of the problem.

In future problems involving hierarchical data, considering a tree representation using dictionaries could be advantageous for clarity and potential extensions.

The main function is `findPotentialKillers`.
INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] The function takes two arguments: the number of members, N, and a list, R, representing the reporting structure where each element indicates to whom the corresponding member reports. It creates a set to track members who are reported to by others. It then iterates through the list R to populate this set with members who are reported to. Next, it identifies members who are not in this set, meaning they are not reported to by anyone, and adds them to a list of potential killers. This list is sorted in ascending order before being returned.

[Problem]
    Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
    Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
    There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
    Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

    -----Input-----
    The first line of input contains one integer N.
    Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

    -----Output-----
    Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
    - 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
    - It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

    -----Subtasks-----
    - Subtask #1 [50 points]: N â‰¤ 10000
    - Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    6

    Output:
    4 5 6
