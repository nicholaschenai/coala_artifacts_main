    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia has a hierarchical structure with one Don at the top, and each member reports to exactly one other member. The Don reports to no one. A potential killer is defined as a minor criminal, which means they are members who nobody reports to. Given the reporting structure, we need to find all such members.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Understanding**: We have `N` members, and each member `i` reports to `Ri`. The Don is the only member with `Ri = 0`.\n\n2. **Output Requirement**: We need to output the indices of members who are potential killers, i.e., those who are not reported to by any other member.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to.\n   - Iterate over the list of reports `R` and add each `Ri` (except 0) to this set.\n   - The potential killers are those members whose indices are not in this set.\n   - Output these indices in ascending order.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction findPotentialKillers(N, R):\n    reported_to = set()\n    for i from 1 to N:\n        if R[i] != 0:\n            add R[i] to reported_to\n    \n    potential_killers = []\n    for i from 1 to N:\n        if i not in reported_to:\n            add i to potential_killers\n    \n    sort potential_killers\n    return potential_killers\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef findPotentialKillers(N, R):\n    # Set to track members who are reported to\n    reported_to = set()\n    \n    # Populate the set with members who are reported to\n    for i in range(N):\n        if R[i] != 0:\n            reported_to.add(R[i])\n    \n    # List to store potential killers\n    potential_killers = []\n    \n    # Identify members who are not reported to by anyone\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if i not in reported_to:\n            potential_killers.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the potential killers in ascending order\n    potential_killers.sort()\n    \n    # Return the list of potential killers\n    return potential_killers\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# First line is the number of members\nN = int(data[0])\n\n# Second line is the reporting structure\nR = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n\n# Find and print the potential killers\nresult = findPotentialKillers(N, R)\nprint(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We use a set `reported_to` to track all members who are reported to by others.\n- We iterate over the reporting list `R` and add each `Ri` to the set, except when `Ri` is 0 (indicating the Don).\n- We then check each member from 1 to N to see if they are not in the `reported_to` set, indicating they are potential killers.\n- Finally, we sort and print the list of potential killers.",
