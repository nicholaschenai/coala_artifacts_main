    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. The key insight was recognizing that this is only feasible when the number of players \\( N \\) is odd. This is because the total number of matches, \\( \\frac{N(N-1)}{2} \\), must be divisible by \\( N \\) for each player to win the same number of matches. For even \\( N \\), this is impossible because the total number of matches is odd.\n\nThe successful strategy involved constructing a round-robin schedule for odd \\( N \\) using a cyclic pattern. Each player \\( i \\) wins against the next \\( \\frac{N-1}{2} \\) players in a circular manner. This ensures that each player wins exactly \\( \\frac{N-1}{2} \\) matches, satisfying the problem's requirements.\n\nThe solution was implemented by iterating over each test case, checking if \\( N \\) is odd, and then constructing the match schedule using nested loops. The cyclic pattern was achieved using modular arithmetic to wrap around the player indices.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of understanding divisibility and modular arithmetic in constructing balanced schedules or distributions. The approach was straightforward once the feasibility condition was identified, and the implementation was efficient given the constraints.",
    "reflection": "The problem was straightforward, and my solution aligned well with the official solution. Both approaches correctly identified that the key to solving the problem is determining whether \\( N \\) is odd or even. If \\( N \\) is even, it's impossible to distribute wins evenly among players, and if \\( N \\) is odd, it is possible.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Odd vs. Even \\( N \\)**:\n   - Both solutions correctly identify that for even \\( N \\), the answer is \"NO\" because the total number of matches is odd, which cannot be evenly distributed among an even number of players.\n   - For odd \\( N \\), the answer is \"YES\", and a valid match schedule can be constructed.\n\n2. **Cyclic Pattern for Scheduling**:\n   - The official solution uses a cyclic pattern to determine the winners, similar to my approach. Each player wins against the next \\( \\frac{N-1}{2} \\) players in a circular manner.\n   - This ensures that each player wins exactly \\( \\frac{N-1}{2} \\) matches, which is the requirement for odd \\( N \\).\n\n3. **Efficiency**:\n   - Both solutions are efficient, operating in \\( O(N^2) \\) time complexity, which is suitable given the constraints.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in combinatorial problems, particularly the role of parity (odd/even) in determining feasibility. The cyclic approach to constructing the schedule is a useful technique for similar problems where a balanced distribution is required. The official solution is concise and effectively implements the logic needed to solve the problem.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and the size of the tournament for each test case. It then processes each test case by determining if the tournament size is odd or even. If the size is even, it outputs \"NO\". If the size is odd, it outputs \"YES\" and constructs a matrix representing the tournament results. The matrix is constructed such that each player plays against every other player, with '1' indicating a win and '0' indicating a loss or no match, ensuring that each player plays exactly half of the other players. The results are printed for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a round-robin tournament can be organized such that each player wins the same number of matches. This is particularly relevant in sports scheduling, game theory, and combinatorial design. The solution shows that such a scenario is only possible when the number of players, N, is odd. This is because, with an odd number of players, you can arrange the matches in a cyclic manner where each player wins exactly half of their matches (rounded down), ensuring fairness. This concept can be applied to any situation where a balanced outcome is desired in a competitive setting with an odd number of participants."
