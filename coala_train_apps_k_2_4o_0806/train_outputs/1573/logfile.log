## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we need to provide a specific arrangement of match outcomes. If not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Each player plays against every other player exactly once.
   - There are no ties, so each match has a winner and a loser.
   - We need to ensure that each player wins the same number of matches.

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - For each player to win the same number of matches, the total number of matches (which is `N * (N - 1) / 2`) must be divisible by `N`. This is only possible if `N` is odd. If `N` is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches.

3. **Constructing the Match Outcomes**:
   - If `N` is odd, we can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly `(N - 1) / 2` matches.
   - For each player `i`, they can win against the next `(N - 1) / 2` players in a cyclic manner.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of players `N`.
   - If `N` is even, print "NO".
   - If `N` is odd:
     - Print "YES".
     - Initialize an `N x N` matrix with all zeros.
     - For each player `i` from 0 to `N-1`:
       - For the next `(N - 1) / 2` players, set the matrix entry to 1 indicating player `i` wins.
     - Print the matrix.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        if N % 2 == 0:
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            # Create an N x N matrix initialized with '0'
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            
            # Each player i wins against the next (N-1)/2 players
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, (N // 2) + 1):
                    winner = i
                    loser = (i + j) % N
                    matrix[winner][loser] = '1'
            
            for row in matrix:
                results.append(''.join(row))
    
    # Print all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results according to the problem's requirements. It constructs a valid tournament scenario when possible and indicates when it's not possible.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts on the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring no two consecutive days have the same dish, and the first and last days are different. The key pattern is recognizing that for `N` days, the number of valid schedules can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the choices of dishes on the first, middle, and last days.

    #### Strategy and Formula
    Initially, the formula used was incorrect for `N > 3`. The correct approach is:
    - For `N = 2`, the result is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).
    - For `N = 3`, the result is \(4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24\).
    - For `N > 3`, the result should be \(4 \times 3^{N-2} \times 2\).

    This formula accounts for:
    - 4 choices for the first day.
    - \(3^{N-2}\) choices for the middle days, ensuring no consecutive days are the same.
    - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it's different from the first day.

    #### Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the formula for `N > 3`, where the last multiplier was incorrectly set. The correct multiplier should ensure the first and last days are different, which is achieved by multiplying by 2, not 3. The misunderstanding of the expected output for `N = 5` was corrected by applying the correct formula, which results in 240, not 216.

    #### Final Code Snippet
    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            if N == 2:
                result = 12
            else:
                result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD
            results.append(result)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        results = calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly understanding the constraints and requirements of the problem, especially when dealing with large values of `N`.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the winner of a game based on the parity (odd or even nature) of a number \( N \). The game rules allowed dividing \( N \) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1 or subtracting 1 from \( N \). The key insight was recognizing that if \( N \) is odd, the first player (me) can always win by making it even for the opponent, who will eventually lose. Conversely, if \( N \) is even, the opponent can make it odd, leading to my loss.

    Initially, the solution logic was correct, but the function was not called, leading to no output. This was a simple oversight that was fixed by ensuring the function `determine_winner()` was called after its definition. This experience reinforced the importance of verifying that all parts of a script, especially function calls, are correctly implemented to ensure the program executes as intended.

    The final solution involved reading input, determining the parity of \( N \) for each test case, and printing "Me" if \( N \) was odd and "Grinch" if even. This approach efficiently solved the problem by leveraging the properties of odd and even numbers in the context of the game's rules.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we should provide a schedule of matches where each player wins the same number of matches. Each player plays against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Each player plays \( N-1 \) matches (since they play against every other player once).
   - For each player to win the same number of matches, the total number of matches \( \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \) must be divisible by \( N \).

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - If \( N \) is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches is odd, and an odd number cannot be evenly distributed among an even number of players.
   - If \( N \) is odd, it is possible because the total number of matches is even, and it can be evenly distributed among the players.

3. **Constructing the Schedule**:
   - For odd \( N \), we can construct a round-robin schedule where each player wins exactly \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) matches.
   - This can be achieved by using a cyclic pattern where each player beats the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a circular manner.

### Pseudocode

```
function solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for each N in test_cases:
        if N is even:
            print "NO"
        else:
            print "YES"
            for i from 0 to N-1:
                row = []
                for j from 0 to N-1:
                    if i == j:
                        row.append('0')
                    else if (j - i + N) % N <= (N-1)/2:
                        row.append('1')
                    else:
                        row.append('0')
                print row as a string

            print("YES")
            for i in range(N):
                row = []
                for j in range(N):
                    if i == j:
                        row.append('0')
                    elif (j - i + N) % N <= (N - 1) // 2:

    main()
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read the number of test cases and the list of \( N \) values.
- **Feasibility Check**: For each \( N \), we check if it is even. If it is, we print "NO" because it's impossible to distribute wins evenly.
- **Schedule Construction**: For odd \( N \), we construct a schedule using a cyclic pattern. Each player \( i \) wins against the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a circular manner.
- **Output**: We print the constructed schedule for each test case.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:

   - For each player to win the same number of matches, the total number of matches \( \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \) must be divisible by \( N \).

2. **Feasibility Check**:

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read the number of test cases and the list of \( N \) values.
- **Feasibility Check**: For each \( N \), we check if it is even. If it is, we print "NO" because it's impossible to distribute wins evenly.
- **Schedule Construction**: For odd \( N \), we construct a schedule using a cyclic pattern. Each player \( i \) wins against the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a circular manner.
- **Output**: We print the constructed schedule for each test case.

A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we should provide a schedule of matches where each player wins the same number of matches. Each player plays against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Each player plays \( N-1 \) matches (since they play against every other player once).
   - For each player to win the same number of matches, the total number of matches \( \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \) must be divisible by \( N \).

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - If \( N \) is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches is odd, and an odd number cannot be evenly distributed among an even number of players.
   - If \( N \) is odd, it is possible because the total number of matches is even, and it can be evenly distributed among the players.

3. **Constructing the Schedule**:
   - For odd \( N \), we can construct a round-robin schedule where each player wins exactly \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) matches.
   - This can be achieved by using a cyclic pattern where each player beats the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a circular manner.

### Pseudocode

```
function solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for each N in test_cases:
        if N is even:
            print "NO"
        else:
            print "YES"
            for i from 0 to N-1:
                row = []
                for j from 0 to N-1:
                    if i == j:
                        row.append('0')
                    else if (j - i + N) % N <= (N-1)/2:
                        row.append('1')
                    else:
                        row.append('0')
                print row as a string
```

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. The key insight was recognizing that this is only feasible when the number of players \( N \) is odd. This is because the total number of matches, \( \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \), must be divisible by \( N \) for each player to win the same number of matches. For even \( N \), this is impossible because the total number of matches is odd.

The successful strategy involved constructing a round-robin schedule for odd \( N \) using a cyclic pattern. Each player \( i \) wins against the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a circular manner. This ensures that each player wins exactly \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) matches, satisfying the problem's requirements.

The solution was implemented by iterating over each test case, checking if \( N \) is odd, and then constructing the match schedule using nested loops. The cyclic pattern was achieved using modular arithmetic to wrap around the player indices.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding divisibility and modular arithmetic in constructing balanced schedules or distributions. The approach was straightforward once the feasibility condition was identified, and the implementation was efficient given the constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution aligned well with the official solution. Both approaches correctly identified that the key to solving the problem is determining whether \( N \) is odd or even. If \( N \) is even, it's impossible to distribute wins evenly among players, and if \( N \) is odd, it is possible.

### Key Insights:

1. **Odd vs. Even \( N \)**:
   - Both solutions correctly identify that for even \( N \), the answer is "NO" because the total number of matches is odd, which cannot be evenly distributed among an even number of players.
   - For odd \( N \), the answer is "YES", and a valid match schedule can be constructed.

2. **Cyclic Pattern for Scheduling**:
   - The official solution uses a cyclic pattern to determine the winners, similar to my approach. Each player wins against the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a circular manner.
   - This ensures that each player wins exactly \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) matches, which is the requirement for odd \( N \).

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Both solutions are efficient, operating in \( O(N^2) \) time complexity, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Reflection:

The problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in combinatorial problems, particularly the role of parity (odd/even) in determining feasibility. The cyclic approach to constructing the schedule is a useful technique for similar problems where a balanced distribution is required. The official solution is concise and effectively implements the logic needed to solve the problem.

The matrix is constructed such that each player plays against every other player, with '1' indicating a win and '0' indicating a loss or no match, ensuring that each player plays exactly half of the other players. The results are printed for each test case.

[Problem]
    A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
    Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
    With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
    Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

    -----Output:-----
    - If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
    - Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
    - If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
    - You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
    - You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
    - $2 \leq N \leq 100$

    -----Subtasks-----
    - 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
    - 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    3
    2

    -----Sample Output:-----
    YES
    010
    001
    100
    NO

    -----Explanation:-----
    One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.
