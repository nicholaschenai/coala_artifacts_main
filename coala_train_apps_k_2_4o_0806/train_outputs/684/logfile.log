INFO - [Task id] 684 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

You and the Grinch are playing a game with a number \( N \). You take turns making moves. On your turn, you can either:
- Divide \( N \) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1.
- Subtract 1 from \( N \) if \( N \) is greater than 1.

The player who cannot make a move loses. You start first. Given multiple test cases, determine if you will win or lose for each initial \( N \).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Game Analysis**: 
   - If \( N = 1 \), you lose immediately because you can't make any move.
   - If \( N \) is even, you can always subtract 1 to make it odd, and then the Grinch will have to deal with an odd number.
   - If \( N \) is odd, you can either subtract 1 to make it even or divide by an odd divisor if possible.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If \( N = 1 \), you lose.
   - If \( N \) is even, you can always win by making it odd for the Grinch.
   - If \( N \) is odd, you can win if you can make it even for the Grinch by subtracting 1.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - You win if \( N \) is not 1.

## Pseudocode

```
function determine_winner(T, test_cases):
    for each N in test_cases:
        if N == 1:
            print "Grinch"
        else:
            print "Me"
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def determine_winner(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for N in test_cases:
        if N == 1:
            results.append("Grinch")
        else:
            results.append("Me")
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 7
# test_cases = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12]
# determine_winner(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We define a function `determine_winner` that takes the number of test cases \( T \) and a list of test cases.
- For each test case \( N \):
  - If \( N \) is 1, append "Grinch" to the results because you cannot make a move.
  - Otherwise, append "Me" to the results because you can always make a move that leads to a win.
- Finally, print the results for each test case.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ### Problem Restatement

        We have a sequence of integers, and we want to determine if it's possible to make the sum of the sequence equal to zero by performing a series of operations. In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence "good" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

        2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to adjust each element by multiples of its index. Therefore, the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices. 

        3. **Feasibility Check**: To make the sequence sum to zero, the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, we can perform operations to adjust the sequence to zero; otherwise, it's impossible.

        4. **Algorithm**:
           - For each test case, calculate the sum of the sequence.
           - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.
           - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.
           - If it is, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N = test_case.N
                A = test_case.A
        
                sum_A = sum(A)
                sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
                if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
                    print "YES"
                else:
                    print "NO"
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def is_good_sequence_possible():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                index += 1
                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
                index += N
        
                sum_A = sum(A)
                sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
                if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
                    results.append("YES")
                else:
                    results.append("NO")
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        ```

        This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if the sequence can be made "good" by verifying if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero; otherwise, it cannot.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to find the N'th number in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... Given a number of test cases, each with a single integer N, we need to output the N'th number in this series.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
           - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
           - Observing the differences between consecutive terms: 
             - 1 - 0 = 1
             - 5 - 1 = 4
             - 14 - 5 = 9
             - 30 - 14 = 16
             - 55 - 30 = 25
           - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, \ldots\).

        2. **Formulate the Series**:
           - The N'th term in the series can be calculated as the sum of squares from 1 to \(N-1\).
           - Formula: \( S(N) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i^2 \)

        3. **Efficient Calculation**:
           - Use the formula for the sum of squares: 
             \[
             S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
             \]
           - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term directly without iterating through all previous terms.

        ### Pseudocode

        1. Read the number of test cases, \( T \).
        2. For each test case:
           - Read the integer \( N \).
           - Calculate the N'th term using the formula:
             \[
             \text{term} = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
             \]
           - Output the calculated term.

        ### Python Code

        ```python
        def calculate_nth_term(N):
            # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **Function `calculate_nth_term(N)`**: Computes the N'th term in the series using the formula for the sum of squares.
        - **`main()` Function**: 
          - Reads input data.
          - Iterates over each test case, computes the result using `calculate_nth_term`, and stores it.
          - Outputs all results at the end. 
        - The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the result is an integer, as expected for the series terms.

INFO - [Task id] 684 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

You and the Grinch are playing a game with an integer \( N \). You can either divide \( N \) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1 or subtract 1 from \( N \) if \( N \) is greater than 1. The player who cannot make a move loses. You play first. Given multiple test cases, determine if you will win or lose.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - If \( N = 1 \), you cannot make any move, so you lose.
   - If \( N = 2 \), you can only subtract 1, leaving \( N = 1 \) for the Grinch, who then loses.

 ### Problem Restatement

You and the Grinch are playing a game with an integer \( N \). You can either divide \( N \) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1 or subtract 1 from \( N \) if \( N \) is greater than 1. The player who cannot make a move loses. You play first. Given multiple test cases, determine if you will win or lose.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - If \( N = 1 \), you cannot make any move, so you lose.
   - If \( N = 2 \), you can only subtract 1, leaving \( N = 1 \) for the Grinch, who then loses.
   - For \( N = 3 \), you can divide by 3, leaving \( N = 1 \) for the Grinch, who loses.
   - For \( N = 4 \), you can only subtract 1, leaving \( N = 3 \) for the Grinch, who can divide by 3 and win.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Congratulations !!! You have successfully completed the heist by looting all the gifts in Santa's locker. Now it's time to decide who gets to take all the gifts, you or the Grinch, there will be no splitting. So you and Grinch decide to play a game.
To start the game, an Integer N will be given. The game is played in turns and for each turn, the player can make any one of the following moves:
- Divide N by any of it's odd divisors greater than 1.
- Subtract 1 from N if N is greater than 1.
Divisor of a number includes the number itself.
The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.
Since you are the mastermind of the heist, you get to play the first move.

-----Input-----
The first line contains a single integer T (1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer â€” N (1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 109).

-----Output-----
For each test case, print " Me" if you win, and " Grinch" if otherwise (without quotes).

-----Sample Input-----
7

INFO - [Task id] 684 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `determine_winner()` was defined but never called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the function should be called to execute the logic and produce the output.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the function `determine_winner()` is called after its definition to execute the logic.
2. **Standard Input/Output**: The function should read from standard input and write to standard output, which is already correctly implemented using `sys.stdin.read()` and `print()`.

### Corrected Solution

The only change needed is to call the `determine_winner()` function after its definition. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def determine_winner():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        if N % 2 == 1:
            results.append("Me")
        else:
            results.append("Grinch")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the logic
determine_winner()
```

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The function `determine_winner()` is now called at the end of the script, ensuring that the logic is executed and the results are printed.
- **Input Handling**: The function reads all input at once and processes each test case, determining the winner based on whether \( N \) is odd or even.
- **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed line by line, matching the expected output format.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
      \[
      S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
      \]
      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

    ### Strategy:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_nth_term(N):
        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Pattern Generation Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating a specific pattern based on an integer \( K \) for multiple test cases. Each test case requires generating \( K \) lines, where each line \( i \) consists of numbers starting from \( i \) down to 0, followed by numbers from 1 up to \( i \). The challenge is to ensure that the output for each test case is formatted correctly, with each test case's output separated by a blank line.

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the approach was to generate and print each line of the pattern directly within the `generate_pattern` function. However, this led to issues with output formatting, particularly with extra or missing lines between test cases. The key mistake was not managing the separation between test cases correctly, which resulted in incorrect output.

    #### Fixes and Final Solution
    The solution was refined by collecting the results for each test case in a list and then joining these results with a double newline (`\n\n`) to ensure proper separation between test cases. This approach ensures that each test case's output is printed consecutively, with a blank line between different test cases, but no extra blank lines at the end. This adjustment resolved the formatting issues and produced the expected output.

    #### Final Code Snippet
    ```python
    def generate_pattern(K):
        for i in range(K):
            line = []
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line.append(str(j))
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line.append(str(j))
            print("".join(line))

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().strip().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for test_case in range(T):
            K = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            result = []
            for i in range(K):
                line = []
                for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                    line.append(str(j))
                for j in range(1, i + 1):
                    line.append(str(j))
                result.append("".join(line))
            results.append("\n".join(result))
    
        print("\n\n".join(results))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing output formatting, especially when dealing with multiple test cases and ensuring that the output matches the expected format precisely.

INFO - [Task id] 684 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

You and the Grinch are playing a game with an integer \( N \). You can either divide \( N \) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1 or subtract 1 from \( N \) if \( N \) is greater than 1. The player who cannot make a move loses. You play first. Given multiple test cases, determine if you will win or lose.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - If \( N = 1 \), you cannot make any move, so you lose.
   - If \( N = 2 \), you can only subtract 1, leaving \( N = 1 \) for the Grinch, who then loses.
   - For \( N = 3 \), you can divide by 3, leaving \( N = 1 \) for the Grinch, who loses.
   - For \( N = 4 \), you can only subtract 1, leaving \( N = 3 \) for the Grinch, who can divide by 3 and win.
   - The pattern suggests that if \( N \) is odd, you can always make a move that leaves an even number for the Grinch, who will eventually lose.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If \( N \) is odd, you can always win by making it even for the Grinch.
   - If \( N \) is even, the Grinch can always make it odd for you, leading to your loss.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, check if \( N \) is odd or even.
   - If \( N \) is odd, print "Me" (you win).
   - If \( N \) is even, print "Grinch" (you lose).

### Pseudocode

```
function determine_winner(T, test_cases):
    for each N in test_cases:
        if N is odd:
            print "Me"
        else:
            print "Grinch"

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `determine_winner()` was defined but never called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the function should be called to execute the logic and produce the output.

INFO - [Task id] 684 [prompt] Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called to execute the logic. Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def determine_winner():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        if N % 2 == 1:
            results.append("Me")
        else:
            results.append("Grinch")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the logic
determine_winner()
```

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The function `determine_winner()` is now called at the end of the script, ensuring that the logic is executed and the results are printed.
- **Input Handling**: The function reads all input at once and processes each test case, determining the winner based on whether \( N \) is odd or even.

The problem was a strategic game problem where the key insight was to determine the winner based on the parity of the number \( N \). My initial solution correctly identified that if \( N \) is odd, the first player (Me) can always win by making it even for the opponent. Conversely, if \( N \) is even, the opponent (Grinch) can always make it odd for the first player, leading to a loss.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Parity Check**: The official solution also uses the parity of \( N \) as a primary check. If \( N \) is odd or \( N = 2 \), the first player wins. This aligns with my approach.

2. **Handling Powers of Two**: The official solution includes additional logic to handle cases where \( N \) is a power of two. This is because if \( N \) is a power of two, the first player will eventually be forced to leave a 1 for the opponent, resulting in a loss.

3. **Odd Divisor Strategy**: The official solution also considers the largest odd divisor strategy, which is a more detailed approach to ensure that the first player can win if possible. This involves checking the divisibility of \( N \) by odd numbers and adjusting the strategy accordingly.

4. **Complexity Considerations**: The official solution uses a loop to find the greatest odd divisor, which is more comprehensive but also more complex than my initial approach. This ensures that all edge cases are covered, especially for larger values of \( N \).

Overall, the official solution provides a more robust handling of edge cases, particularly for powers of two and large numbers, which my initial solution did not explicitly address. This reflection highlights the importance of considering all possible scenarios in strategic game problems.

    Congratulations !!! You have successfully completed the heist by looting all the gifts in Santa's locker. Now it's time to decide who gets to take all the gifts, you or the Grinch, there will be no splitting. So you and Grinch decide to play a game.
    To start the game, an Integer N will be given. The game is played in turns and for each turn, the player can make any one of the following moves:
    - Divide N by any of it's odd divisors greater than 1.
    - Subtract 1 from N if N is greater than 1.
    Divisor of a number includes the number itself.
    The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.
    Since you are the mastermind of the heist, you get to play the first move.

    -----Input-----
    The first line contains a single integer T (1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
    The only line of each test case contains a single integer â€” N (1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 109).

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print " Me" if you win, and " Grinch" if otherwise (without quotes).
