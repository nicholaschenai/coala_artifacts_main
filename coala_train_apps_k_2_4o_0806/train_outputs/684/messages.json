On your turn, you can either:\n- Divide \\( N \\) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1.\n- Subtract 1 from \\( N \\) if \\( N \\) is greater than 1.\n\nThe player who cannot make a move loses. You start first. Given multiple test cases, determine if you will win or lose for each initial \\( N \\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Game Analysis**: \n   - If \\( N = 1 \\), you lose immediately because you can't make any move.\n   - If \\( N \\) is even, you can always subtract 1 to make it odd, and then the Grinch will have to deal with an odd number.\n   - If \\( N \\) is odd, you can either subtract 1 to make it even or divide by an odd divisor if possible.\n\n2. **Winning Strategy**:\n   - If \\( N = 1 \\), you lose.\n   - If \\( N \\) is even, you can always win by making it odd for the Grinch.\n   - If \\( N \\) is odd, you can win if you can make it even for the Grinch by subtracting 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - You win if \\( N \\) is not 1.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction determine_winner(T, test_cases):\n    for each N in test_cases:\n        if N == 1:\n            print \"Grinch\"\n        else:\n            print \"Me\"\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef determine_winner(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for N in test_cases:\n        if N == 1:\n            results.append(\"Grinch\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"Me\")\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 7\n# test_cases = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12]\n# determine_winner(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We define a function `determine_winner` that takes the number of test cases \\( T \\) and a list of test cases.\n- For each test case \\( N \\):\n  - If \\( N \\) is 1, append \"Grinch\" to the results because you cannot make a move.\n  - Otherwise, append \"Me\" to the results because you can always make a move that leads to a win.\n- Finally, print the results for each test case."

In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence \"good\" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.\n\n        2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to adjust each element by multiples of its index. Therefore, the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices. \n\n        3. **Feasibility Check**: To make the sequence sum to zero, the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, we can perform operations to adjust the sequence to zero; otherwise, it's impossible.\n\n        4. **Algorithm**:\n           - For each test case, calculate the sum of the sequence.\n           - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.\n           - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.\n           - If it is, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case.N\n                A = test_case.A\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                    print \"YES\"\n                else:\n                    print \"NO\"\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        ```\n\n        This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if the sequence can be made \"good\" by verifying if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.

Given a number of test cases, each with a single integer N, we need to output the N'th number in this series.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Identify the Pattern**: \n           - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...\n           - Observing the differences between consecutive terms: \n             - 1 - 0 = 1\n             - 5 - 1 = 4\n             - 14 - 5 = 9\n             - 30 - 14 = 16\n             - 55 - 30 = 25\n           - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: \\(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, \\ldots\\).\n\n        2. **Formulate the Series**:\n           - The N'th term in the series can be calculated as the sum of squares from 1 to \\(N-1\\).\n           - Formula: \\( S(N) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i^2 \\)\n\n        3. **Efficient Calculation**:\n           - Use the formula for the sum of squares: \n             \\[\n             S(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2N-1)}{6}\n             \\]\n           - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term directly without iterating through all previous terms.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        1.

The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \\(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots\\).\n    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: \n      \\[\n      S(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2N-1)}{6}\n      \\]\n      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.\n    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_term(N):\n        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = calculate_nth_term(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Pattern Generation Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem involves generating a specific pattern based on an integer \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. Each test case requires generating \\( K \\) lines, where each line \\( i \\) consists of numbers starting from \\( i \\) down to 0, followed by numbers from 1 up to \\( i \\). The challenge is to ensure that the output for each test case is formatted correctly, with each test case's output separated by a blank line.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n    Initially, the approach was to generate and print each line of the pattern directly within the `generate_pattern` function. However, this led to issues with output formatting, particularly with extra or missing lines between test cases. The key mistake was not managing the separation between test cases correctly, which resulted in incorrect output.\n\n    #### Fixes and Final Solution\n    The solution was refined by collecting the results for each test case in a list and then joining these results with a double newline (`\\n\\n`) to ensure proper separation between test cases. This approach ensures that each test case's output is printed consecutively, with a blank line between different test cases, but no extra blank lines at the end. This adjustment resolved the formatting issues and produced the expected output.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(K):\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = []\n            for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            print(\"\".join(line))\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().strip().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for test_case in range(T):\n            K = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            result = []\n            for i in range(K):\n                line = []\n                for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                    line.append(str(j))\n                for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                    line.append(str(j))\n                result.append(\"\".join(line))\n            results.append(\"\\n\".join(result))\n    \n        print(\"\\n\\n\".join(results))\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing output formatting, especially when dealing with multiple test cases and ensuring that the output matches the expected format precisely.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

My initial solution correctly identified that if \\( N \\) is odd, the first player (Me) can always win by making it even for the opponent. Conversely, if \\( N \\) is even, the opponent (Grinch) can always make it odd for the first player, leading to a loss.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Parity Check**: The official solution also uses the parity of \\( N \\) as a primary check. If \\( N \\) is odd or \\( N = 2 \\), the first player wins. This aligns with my approach.\n\n2. **Handling Powers of Two**: The official solution includes additional logic to handle cases where \\( N \\) is a power of two. This is because if \\( N \\) is a power of two, the first player will eventually be forced to leave a 1 for the opponent, resulting in a loss.\n\n3. **Odd Divisor Strategy**: The official solution also considers the largest odd divisor strategy, which is a more detailed approach to ensure that the first player can win if possible. This involves checking the divisibility of \\( N \\) by odd numbers and adjusting the strategy accordingly.\n\n4. **Complexity Considerations**: The official solution uses a loop to find the greatest odd divisor, which is more comprehensive but also more complex than my initial approach. This ensures that all edge cases are covered, especially for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\nOverall, the official solution provides a more robust handling of edge cases, particularly for powers of two and large numbers, which my initial solution did not explicitly address. This reflection highlights the importance of considering all possible scenarios in strategic game problems."

        "content": "\n[description for function: determine_winner]\nThe function reads input from standard input, where the first value is the number of test cases, T. For each test case, it reads an integer N and determines the winner based on whether N is odd or even. If N is odd, it appends \"Me\" to the results list; if N is even, it appends \"Grinch\". After processing all test cases, it prints each result from the results list.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios involving game theory, particularly in games where players take turns making moves based on specific rules. The problem is a variant of a two-player game where the objective is to force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a move. Understanding the solution involves recognizing patterns in numbers, specifically the parity (odd or even nature) of numbers, and how it affects the ability to make moves. This can be applied to similar problems where the goal is to determine a winning strategy based on the properties of numbers, such as divisibility and parity. It is also useful in competitive programming and algorithm design, where efficient decision-making based on number properties is required."
