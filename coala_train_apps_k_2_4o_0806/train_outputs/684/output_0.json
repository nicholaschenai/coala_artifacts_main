    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nYou and the Grinch are playing a game with an integer \\( N \\). You can either divide \\( N \\) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1 or subtract 1 from \\( N \\) if \\( N \\) is greater than 1. The player who cannot make a move loses. You play first. Given multiple test cases, determine if you will win or lose.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Game Analysis**:\n   - If \\( N = 1 \\), you cannot make any move, so you lose.\n   - If \\( N = 2 \\), you can only subtract 1, leaving \\( N = 1 \\) for the Grinch, who then loses.\n   - For \\( N = 3 \\), you can divide by 3, leaving \\( N = 1 \\) for the Grinch, who loses.\n   - For \\( N = 4 \\), you can only subtract 1, leaving \\( N = 3 \\) for the Grinch, who can divide by 3 and win.\n   - The pattern suggests that if \\( N \\) is odd, you can always make a move that leaves an even number for the Grinch, who will eventually lose.\n\n2. **Winning Strategy**:\n   - If \\( N \\) is odd, you can always win by making it even for the Grinch.\n   - If \\( N \\) is even, the Grinch can always make it odd for you, leading to your loss.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each test case, check if \\( N \\) is odd or even.\n   - If \\( N \\) is odd, print \"Me\" (you win).\n   - If \\( N \\) is even, print \"Grinch\" (you lose).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction determine_winner(T, test_cases):\n    for each N in test_cases:\n        if N is odd:\n            print \"Me\"\n        else:\n            print \"Grinch\"\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef determine_winner():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        if N % 2 == 1:\n            results.append(\"Me\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"Grinch\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```",
