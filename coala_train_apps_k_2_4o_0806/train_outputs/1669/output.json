    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nAlice has a hand of cards represented as an array of integers. She wants to rearrange these cards into groups where each group has exactly `W` cards, and the cards in each group are consecutive integers. The task is to determine if this rearrangement is possible.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements**: We need to form groups of size `W` where each group consists of consecutive numbers. This means that for each group, the numbers should be in a sequence like `[x, x+1, ..., x+W-1]`.\n\n2. **Feasibility Check**: \n   - The total number of cards must be divisible by `W` for it to be possible to form groups of size `W`.\n   - We need to ensure that for each starting card in a group, there are enough consecutive cards to complete the group.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Count the occurrences of each card using a dictionary.\n   - Sort the unique cards.\n   - Try to form groups starting from the smallest card. For each card, check if the next `W-1` consecutive cards are available in the required quantity.\n   - If at any point, a group cannot be formed, return `False`.\n   - If all cards can be grouped successfully, return `True`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction isNStraightHand(hand, W):\n    if length of hand is not divisible by W:\n        return False\n\n    count = dictionary to count occurrences of each card\n    for card in hand:\n        increment count[card]\n\n    sort the unique cards in hand\n\n    for each card in sorted unique cards:\n        while count[card] > 0:\n            for i from 0 to W-1:\n                if count[card + i] is 0:\n                    return False\n                decrement count[card + i]\n\n    return True\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], W: int) -> bool:\n        # Check if the total number of cards is divisible by W\n        if len(hand) % W != 0:\n            return False\n        \n        # Dictionary to count occurrences of each card\n        count = {}\n        for card in hand:\n            if card in count:\n                count[card] += 1\n            else:\n                count[card] = 1\n        \n        # Sort the unique cards\n        unique_cards = sorted(count.keys())\n        \n        # Try to form groups starting from the smallest card\n        for card in unique_cards:\n            while count[card] > 0:\n                # Try to form a group starting with this card\n                for i in range(W):\n                    if count.get(card + i, 0) == 0:\n                        return False\n                    count[card + i] -= 1\n        \n        return True\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently checks if the cards can be grouped into consecutive sequences of size `W` by using a dictionary to count occurrences and iterating over sorted unique cards to form the required groups.",
