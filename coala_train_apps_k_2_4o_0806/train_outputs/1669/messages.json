The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.\n\n    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.\n\n    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.\n\n    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n        \n            sum_A = sum(A)\n            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                k = sum_A // sum_indices\n                possible = True\n                for i in range(N):\n                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                if possible:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.\n        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.

In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence \"good\" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.\n\n        2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to adjust each element by multiples of its index. Therefore, the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices. \n\n        3. **Feasibility Check**: To make the sequence sum to zero, the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, we can perform operations to adjust the sequence to zero; otherwise, it's impossible.\n\n        4. **Algorithm**:\n           - For each test case, calculate the sum of the sequence.\n           - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.\n           - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.\n           - If it is, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case.N\n                A = test_case.A\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                    print \"YES\"\n                else:\n                    print \"NO\"\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        ```\n\n        This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if the sequence can be made \"good\" by verifying if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.

Both my solution and the official solution aim to achieve the same goal, but they approach the problem differently.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Use of a Queue**: The official solution uses a queue (`deque`) to manage the number of groups that are currently \"open\" and need to be completed. This is a clever way to track how many groups are in progress and how many cards are needed to complete them.\n\n2. **Efficient Group Management**: By using a queue, the solution efficiently manages the transition of groups as it iterates through the sorted cards. When a group is completed (i.e., when the queue length reaches `W`), it removes the oldest group from the queue, effectively closing it.\n\n3. **Handling Gaps**: The solution checks for gaps between consecutive numbers. If there is a gap and there are still open groups, it immediately returns `False`, as it's impossible to complete the groups.\n\n4. **Counter for Card Frequency**: The use of `Counter` from the `collections` module simplifies the counting of card occurrences, making the solution concise and easy to understand.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\n\n- My approach was straightforward, using a dictionary to count occurrences and iterating over sorted unique cards to form groups. It was effective and passed the test cases.\n- The official solution, however, introduces a more sophisticated mechanism with the queue to manage open groups, which is a more elegant way to handle the problem, especially when dealing with gaps and ensuring all groups are completed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe official solution provides a more nuanced approach to managing the constraints of the problem, particularly with the use of a queue to track open groups. This method is not only efficient but also enhances the clarity of the logic involved in forming consecutive groups. In future problems involving grouping or sequencing, considering a queue to manage state transitions could be a valuable strategy."

It first verifies if the total number of cards is divisible by W, returning False if not. It then counts the occurrences of each card and sorts the unique card values. The function attempts to form groups starting from the smallest card, ensuring each group contains W consecutive cards. If it cannot form a group due to a missing card, it returns False. If all cards can be grouped successfully, it returns True.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a sequence of items can be grouped into specific patterns or sets. This is common in card games, scheduling problems, or any situation where items need to be organized into consecutive groups of a fixed size. The solution involves checking divisibility, counting occurrences, and attempting to form groups starting from the smallest item, which is a common strategy in combinatorial problems. Understanding this approach can help in solving similar problems where grouping or partitioning of items is required based on certain rules."
