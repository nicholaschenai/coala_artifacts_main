INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a game scenario with `N` sabotages, each initially at level 0. There are also `N` imposters, each with a specific task. The `i-th` imposter will increase the level of the `x-th` sabotage by 1 if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `x` is equal to `i`. After all imposters have completed their tasks, we need to determine how many sabotages have reached level 5.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the GCD Condition**: The condition `gcd(i, x) = i` implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. This means that for each imposter `i`, they will increase the level of all sabotages that are multiples of `i`.

2. **Level Calculation**: For a given sabotage `x`, its level will be increased by every imposter `i` that is a divisor of `x`. Therefore, the level of a sabotage `x` is equal to the number of divisors of `x`.

3. **Counting Level 5 Sabotages**: We need to count how many numbers from 1 to `N` have exactly 5 divisors. This is equivalent to counting numbers that have exactly 5 divisors.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the constraints, directly iterating over all numbers up to `N` is not feasible. Instead, we need a mathematical insight:
   - A number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. This is because the divisors of `p^4` are `1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4`.

5. **Prime Calculation**: We need to find all prime numbers `p` such that `p^4 <= N`.

## Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read `N`.
   - Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
   - For each integer `p` starting from 2:
     - If `p^4 > N`, break the loop.
     - Check if `p` is a prime number.
     - If `p` is prime, increment `count`.
   - Output `count`.

## Python Solution

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
    count = 0
    p = 2
    while p**4 <= N:
        if is_prime(p):
            count += 1
        p += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        results.append(count_sabotages_at_level_5(N))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution efficiently calculates the number of sabotages at level 5 by leveraging the mathematical property that a number with exactly 5 divisors must be of the form `p^4`, where `p` is a prime number. The function `is_prime` is used to check the primality of numbers, and the main function handles input and output.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
      \[
      S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
      \]
      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

    ### Strategy:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_nth_term(N):
        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_nth_term(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to find the N'th number in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... Given a number of test cases, each with a single integer N, we need to output the N'th number in this series.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
           - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
           - Observing the differences between consecutive terms: 
             - 1 - 0 = 1
             - 5 - 1 = 4
             - 14 - 5 = 9
             - 30 - 14 = 16
             - 55 - 30 = 25
           - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, \ldots\).

        2. **Formulate the Series**:
           - The N'th term in the series can be calculated as the sum of squares from 1 to \(N-1\).
           - Formula: \( S(N) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i^2 \)

        3. **Efficient Calculation**:
           - Use the formula for the sum of squares: 
             \[
             S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
             \]
           - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term directly without iterating through all previous terms.

        ### Pseudocode

        1. Read the number of test cases, \( T \).
        2. For each test case:
           - Read the integer \( N \).
           - Calculate the N'th term using the formula:
             \[
             \text{term} = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
             \]
           - Output the calculated term.

        ### Python Code

        ```python
        def calculate_nth_term(N):
            # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **Function `calculate_nth_term(N)`**: Computes the N'th term in the series using the formula for the sum of squares.
        - **`main()` Function**: 
          - Reads input data.
          - Iterates over each test case, computes the result using `calculate_nth_term`, and stores it.
          - Outputs all results at the end. 
        - The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the result is an integer, as expected for the series terms.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a game scenario where there are `N` sabotages, each initially at level 0. There are also `N` imposters, each tasked with upgrading the level of sabotages. The `i-th` imposter will increase the level of the `x-th` sabotage by one if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `x` is equal to `i`. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have completed their tasks.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: 
   - The condition `gcd(i, x) = i` implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. This means that for each imposter `i`, they will increase the level of all sabotages whose indices are multiples of `i`.

2. **Level Calculation**:
   - For a sabotage at index `x`, its level will be increased by every imposter `i` that is a divisor of `x`. Therefore, the level of a sabotage at index `x` is equal to the number of divisors of `x`.

3. **Counting Sabotages at Level 5**:
   - We need to count how many numbers from 1 to `N` have exactly 5 divisors.

4. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - A number can have exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` (where `p` is a prime number) or `p^1 * q^1` (where `p` and `q` are distinct prime numbers). However, for a number to have exactly 5 divisors, it must be of the form `p^4` because `p^1 * q^1` would have 4 divisors.
   - Therefore, we need to find all numbers of the form `p^4` that are less than or equal to `N`.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer `N`.
   - Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
   - For each prime `p` such that `p^4 <= N`:
     - Increment `count`.
   - Output `count`.

### Python Code

 ### Problem Restatement

We have a game scenario where there are `N` sabotages, each initially at level 0. There are also `N` imposters, each tasked with upgrading the level of sabotages. The `i-th` imposter will increase the level of the `x-th` sabotage by one if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `x` is equal to `i`. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have completed their tasks.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: 
   - The condition `gcd(i, x) = i` implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. This means that for each imposter `i`, they will increase the level of all sabotages whose indices are multiples of `i`.

2. **Level Calculation**:
   - For a sabotage at index `x`, its level will be increased by every imposter `i` that is a divisor of `x`. Therefore, the level of a sabotage at index `x` is equal to the number of divisors of `x`.

3. **Counting Sabotages at Level 5**:
   - We need to count how many numbers from 1 to `N` have exactly 5 divisors.

4. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - A number can have exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` (where `p` is a prime number) or `p^1 * q^1` (where `p` and `q` are distinct prime numbers). However, for a number to have exactly 5 divisors, it must be of the form `p^4` because `p^1 * q^1` would have 4 divisors.
   - Therefore, we need to find all numbers of the form `p^4` that are less than or equal to `N`.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer `N`.
   - Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
   - For each prime `p` such that `p^4 <= N`:
     - Increment `count`.
   - Output `count`.

            i += 6

The problem of determining how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have completed their tasks is an interesting exercise in understanding number theory, specifically the properties of divisors. The key insight is recognizing that a sabotage reaches level 5 if and only if its index has exactly 5 divisors. This occurs when the index is of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Prime Sieve for Efficiency**:
   - The official solution uses a sieve method to efficiently generate a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit. This is crucial because it allows us to quickly determine which numbers can be raised to the fourth power to potentially be indices of sabotages that reach level 5.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - By precomputing the fourth powers of all primes up to a certain limit, the solution can quickly determine how many such numbers are less than or equal to \( N \) using binary search. This is a significant optimization over checking each number individually.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The use of the `bisect` module to perform a binary search on the precomputed list of fourth powers is a clever way to quickly count the number of valid indices. This reduces the problem to a logarithmic time complexity operation for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

#### Comparison with My Approach:

- My initial approach involved iterating over potential prime numbers and checking if their fourth power was less than or equal to \( N \). While this is conceptually correct, the official solution's use of precomputation and binary search is more efficient, especially for large inputs.
- The official solution's use of a sieve to generate primes is a standard and efficient method for prime generation, which I could incorporate into future solutions involving prime numbers.

Overall, the official solution is a well-optimized approach that leverages precomputation and efficient searching techniques to handle large input sizes effectively. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and using efficient algorithms for prime number generation and searching.

The main function is `main`.
INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] The function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases, followed by T integers. For each integer N, it calculates the number of prime numbers p such that p raised to the power of 4 is less than or equal to N. It stores the results for each test case in a list and then prints each result on a new line.

[Problem]
    There are $N$ sabotages available in the game Among Us, initially all at level $0$. 
    $N$ imposters are allotted the task to upgrade the level of the sabotages. 
    The $i^{th}$ imposter $(1 \leq i \leq N)$ increases the level of $x^{th}$ sabotage $(1 \leq x \leq N)$ by one level  if $gcd(i,x)=i$.
    You need to find the number of sabotages at LEVEL 5 after all the imposters have completed their tasks.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer $N$. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each testcase, output in a single line the number of sabotages at LEVEL 5.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    6

    -----Sample Output:-----
    0

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    The $1^{st}$ sabotage is at level $1$, the $2^{nd}$, $3^{rd}$ and $5^{th}$ sabotages are at level $2$, the $4^{th}$ sabotage is at level $3$ and the $6^{th}$ sabotage is at level $4$.
    None of them reach level $5$. Hence the output is $0$.
