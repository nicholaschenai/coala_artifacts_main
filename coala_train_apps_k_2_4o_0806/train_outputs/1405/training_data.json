    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was understanding how the level of sabotages is determined by the number of divisors of their indices. The key insight was recognizing that a sabotage reaches level 5 if its index has exactly 5 divisors. This led to the realization that such numbers are of the form `p^4`, where `p` is a prime number.\n\nThe strategy that worked was to iterate over potential prime numbers and check if their fourth power is less than or equal to `N`. This approach efficiently counts the number of sabotages at level 5 by leveraging the properties of prime numbers and their powers.\n\nThe problem required careful handling of large inputs, as `N` could be as large as `10^18`. The solution efficiently checks for prime numbers and calculates their fourth powers, ensuring that the algorithm runs in a reasonable time for the given constraints.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding number theory concepts, particularly the distribution of divisors and the properties of prime numbers, in solving computational problems efficiently.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem of determining how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have completed their tasks is an interesting exercise in understanding number theory, specifically the properties of divisors. The key insight is recognizing that a sabotage reaches level 5 if and only if its index has exactly 5 divisors. This occurs when the index is of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Prime Sieve for Efficiency**:\n   - The official solution uses a sieve method to efficiently generate a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit. This is crucial because it allows us to quickly determine which numbers can be raised to the fourth power to potentially be indices of sabotages that reach level 5.\n\n2. **Precomputation**:\n   - By precomputing the fourth powers of all primes up to a certain limit, the solution can quickly determine how many such numbers are less than or equal to \\( N \\) using binary search. This is a significant optimization over checking each number individually.\n\n3. **Binary Search**:\n   - The use of the `bisect` module to perform a binary search on the precomputed list of fourth powers is a clever way to quickly count the number of valid indices. This reduces the problem to a logarithmic time complexity operation for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n#### Comparison with My Approach:\n\n- My initial approach involved iterating over potential prime numbers and checking if their fourth power was less than or equal to \\( N \\). While this is conceptually correct, the official solution's use of precomputation and binary search is more efficient, especially for large inputs.\n- The official solution's use of a sieve to generate primes is a standard and efficient method for prime generation, which I could incorporate into future solutions involving prime numbers.\n\nOverall, the official solution is a well-optimized approach that leverages precomputation and efficient searching techniques to handle large input sizes effectively. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and using efficient algorithms for prime number generation and searching.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases, followed by T integers. For each integer N, it calculates the number of prime numbers p such that p raised to the power of 4 is less than or equal to N. It stores the results for each test case in a list and then prints each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the number of elements that reach a certain level based on specific conditions involving prime numbers and their powers. The problem involves understanding the relationship between prime numbers and their powers, specifically the fourth power, and how they relate to a given number N. This is applicable in mathematical problems involving prime factorization, number theory, and computational problems where constraints are large, such as N up to 10^18. It also demonstrates efficient computation techniques for large inputs, which is crucial in competitive programming and algorithm design."
