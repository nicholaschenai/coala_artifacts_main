        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe have a game scenario with `N` sabotages, each initially at level 0. There are also `N` imposters, each with a specific task. The `i-th` imposter will increase the level of the `x-th` sabotage by 1 if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `x` is equal to `i`. After all imposters have completed their tasks, we need to determine how many sabotages have reached level 5.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the GCD Condition**: The condition `gcd(i, x) = i` implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. This means that for each imposter `i`, they will increase the level of all sabotages that are multiples of `i`.\n\n2. **Level Calculation**: For a given sabotage `x`, its level will be increased by every imposter `i` that is a divisor of `x`. Therefore, the level of a sabotage `x` is equal to the number of divisors of `x`.\n\n3. **Counting Level 5 Sabotages**: We need to count how many numbers from 1 to `N` have exactly 5 divisors. This is equivalent to counting numbers that have exactly 5 divisors.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the constraints, directly iterating over all numbers up to `N` is not feasible. Instead, we need a mathematical insight:\n   - A number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. This is because the divisors of `p^4` are `1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4`.\n\n5. **Prime Calculation**: We need to find all prime numbers `p` such that `p^4 <= N`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. For each test case:\n   - Read `N`.\n   - Initialize a counter `count` to 0.\n   - For each integer `p` starting from 2:\n     - If `p^4 > N`, break the loop.\n     - Check if `p` is a prime number.\n     - If `p` is prime, increment `count`.\n   - Output `count`.\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    if num <= 3:\n        return True\n    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= num:\n        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):\n    count = 0\n    p = 2\n    while p**4 <= N:\n        if is_prime(p):\n            count += 1\n        p += 1\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        results.append(count_sabotages_at_level_5(N))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the number of sabotages at level 5 by leveraging the mathematical property that a number with exactly 5 divisors must be of the form `p^4`, where `p` is a prime number. The function `is_prime` is used to check the primality of numbers, and the main function handles input and output."

The key insight is recognizing that a sabotage reaches level 5 if and only if its index has exactly 5 divisors. This occurs when the index is of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Prime Sieve for Efficiency**:\n   - The official solution uses a sieve method to efficiently generate a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit. This is crucial because it allows us to quickly determine which numbers can be raised to the fourth power to potentially be indices of sabotages that reach level 5.\n\n2. **Precomputation**:\n   - By precomputing the fourth powers of all primes up to a certain limit, the solution can quickly determine how many such numbers are less than or equal to \\( N \\) using binary search. This is a significant optimization over checking each number individually.\n\n3. **Binary Search**:\n   - The use of the `bisect` module to perform a binary search on the precomputed list of fourth powers is a clever way to quickly count the number of valid indices. This reduces the problem to a logarithmic time complexity operation for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n#### Comparison with My Approach:\n\n- My initial approach involved iterating over potential prime numbers and checking if their fourth power was less than or equal to \\( N \\). While this is conceptually correct, the official solution's use of precomputation and binary search is more efficient, especially for large inputs.\n- The official solution's use of a sieve to generate primes is a standard and efficient method for prime generation, which I could incorporate into future solutions involving prime numbers.\n\nOverall, the official solution is a well-optimized approach that leverages precomputation and efficient searching techniques to handle large input sizes effectively. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and using efficient algorithms for prime number generation and searching."
