    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to help Chef reach Dr. Doof by determining how many walls Chef needs to break through. The area is represented as the first quadrant of a coordinate system, with Dr. Doof located at the origin (0, 0). There are N walls, each represented by a line segment from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i). For each starting position of Chef (x_j, y_j), we need to determine how many walls Chef must break through to reach the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Wall Representation**: Each wall is represented by the line x + y = a_i. If a point (x_j, y_j) satisfies this equation for any a_i, it lies on the wall.\n\n2. **Determine Walls to Break**:\n   - For each query point (x_j, y_j), check if it lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.\n   - If not, count how many walls Chef needs to break through. This is equivalent to counting how many a_i are greater than x_j + y_j.\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: Since the a_i values are sorted, we can use binary search to efficiently determine how many walls Chef needs to break.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries):\n    results = []\n    for each query (x_j, y_j):\n        sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n        if sum_xy is in walls:\n            results.append(-1)\n        else:\n            # Use binary search to find the number of walls to break\n            count = number of walls with a_i > sum_xy\n            results.append(count)\n    return results\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read N\n        read walls (sorted list of a_i)\n        read Q\n        read queries\n        results = process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries)\n        for each result in results:\n            print result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries):\n    results = []\n    for x_j, y_j in queries:\n        sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n        if sum_xy in walls:\n            results.append(-1)\n        else:\n            # Binary search to find the number of walls with a_i > sum_xy\n            left, right = 0, N\n            while left < right:\n                mid = (left + right) // 2\n                if walls[mid] > sum_xy:\n                    right = mid\n                else:\n                    left = mid + 1\n            results.append(N - left)\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        walls = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        \n        Q = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        queries = []\n        for _ in range(Q):\n            x_j = int(data[index])\n            y_j = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            queries.append((x_j, y_j))\n        \n        results.extend(process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Binary Search**: We use binary search to efficiently determine how many walls Chef needs to break. This is done by finding the first wall with a_i greater than x_j + y_j.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If Chef starts on a wall, we immediately return -1.\n- **Efficiency**: The use of binary search ensures that our solution is efficient even for large inputs, adhering to the constraints.",
