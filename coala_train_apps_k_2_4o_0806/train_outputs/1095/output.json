    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are not in order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can leverage the concept of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). The idea is that the books that are already in the correct order form an increasing subsequence. The minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of this longest increasing subsequence. This is because the books that are not part of the LIS need to be moved to achieve the sorted order.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function findLISLength(arr):\n       Initialize an empty list 'lis'\n       For each book in arr:\n           If lis is empty or book is greater than the last element in lis:\n               Append book to lis\n           Else:\n               Find the position in lis where book should be placed to maintain sorted order\n               Replace the element at that position with book\n       Return the length of lis\n\n   Function minMovesToSortBooks(N, books):\n       lis_length = findLISLength(books)\n       Return N - lis_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef findLISLength(arr):\n    # This function finds the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)\n    # using a binary search approach for efficiency.\n    lis = []\n    for book in arr:\n        # If lis is empty or the current book is greater than the last element in lis\n        if not lis or book > lis[-1]:\n            lis.append(book)\n        else:\n            # Find the position where the current book should be placed\n            # to maintain the sorted order of lis\n            left, right = 0, len(lis) - 1\n            while left < right:\n                mid = (left + right) // 2\n                if lis[mid] < book:\n                    left = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    right = mid\n            # Replace the element at the found position with the current book\n            lis[left] = book\n    # Return the length of the LIS\n    return len(lis)\n\ndef minMovesToSortBooks(N, books):\n    # Calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    lis_length = findLISLength(books)\n    # The minimum number of moves is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS\n    return N - lis_length\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\nN = int(data[0])\nbooks = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n\n# Output the result\nprint(minMovesToSortBooks(N, books))\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of moves required to sort the books by finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence and subtracting it from the total number of books.",
