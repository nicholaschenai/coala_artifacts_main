## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are not in order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick up any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. This is because the books in this subsequence do not need to be moved. The minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of this longest subsequence.

1. **Identify the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):** The longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order is the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) of the given permutation.
2. **Calculate Moves:** The minimum number of moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of books, `N`.
2. Read the list of books as a permutation.
3. Initialize an empty list `lis` to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.
4. For each book in the permutation:
   - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can replace an element to maintain the increasing order.
   - If the book is larger than all elements in `lis`, append it to `lis`.
   - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.
5. The length of `lis` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
6. The minimum number of moves is `N - len(lis)`.
7. Print the result.

### Python Code

```python
def min_moves_to_sort_books():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    # Function to find the position to replace in LIS using binary search
    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lis[mid] < book:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
    
    # Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence
    lis = []
    for book in books:
        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
        if pos < len(lis):
            lis[pos] = book
        else:
            lis.append(book)
    
    # Minimum moves is total books minus the length of LIS
    min_moves = N - len(lis)
    print(min_moves)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We read the input and parse the number of books and their current order.
- We define a helper function `binary_search_lis` to find the correct position in the `lis` list where a book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.
- We iterate over each book, using binary search to determine where it fits in the `lis`. If it fits within the current `lis`, we replace the element at that position. If it is larger than all current elements, we append it.
- The length of `lis` gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
- The minimum number of moves required is the total number of books minus the length of this subsequence, which we then print.

    Title: Longest increasing subsequence
    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

    Let $\texttt{length}(k)$ denote
    the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position $k$.
    Thus, if we calculate all values of
    $\texttt{length}(k)$ where $0 \le k \le n-1$,
    we will find out the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence.
    For example, the values of the function
    for the above array are as follows:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{length}(0) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(4) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{length}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(6) & = & 4 \\
    \texttt{length}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{length}(6)=4$,
    because the longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position 6 consists of 4 elements.

    To calculate a value of $\texttt{length}(k)$,
    we should find a position $i<k$
    for which $\texttt{array}[i]<\texttt{array}[k]$
    and $\texttt{length}(i)$ is as large as possible.
    Then we know that
    $\texttt{length}(k)=\texttt{length}(i)+1$,
    because this is an optimal way to add
    $\texttt{array}[k]$ to a subsequence.
    However, if there is no such position $i$,
    then $\texttt{length}(k)=1$,
    which means that the subsequence only contains
    $\texttt{array}[k]$.

    Since all values of the function can be calculated
    from its smaller values,
    we can use dynamic programming.
    In the following code, the values
    of the function will be stored in an array
    $\texttt{length}$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        length[k] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (array[i] < array[k]) {
                length[k] = max(length[k],length[i]+1);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    This code works in $O(n^2)$ time,
    because it consists of two nested loops.
    However, it is also possible to implement
    the dynamic programming calculation
    more efficiently in $O(n \log n)$ time.
    Can you find a way to do this?

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are not in order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can leverage the concept of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). The idea is that the books that are already in the correct order form an increasing subsequence. The minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of this longest increasing subsequence. This is because the books that are not part of the LIS need to be moved to achieve the sorted order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function findLISLength(arr):
       Initialize an empty list 'lis'
       For each book in arr:
           If lis is empty or book is greater than the last element in lis:
               Append book to lis
           Else:
               Find the position in lis where book should be placed to maintain sorted order
               Replace the element at that position with book
       Return the length of lis

   Function minMovesToSortBooks(N, books):
       lis_length = findLISLength(books)
       Return N - lis_length
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def findLISLength(arr):
    # This function finds the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
    # using a binary search approach for efficiency.
    lis = []
    for book in arr:
        # If lis is empty or the current book is greater than the last element in lis
        if not lis or book > lis[-1]:
            lis.append(book)
        else:
            # Find the position where the current book should be placed
            # to maintain the sorted order of lis
            left, right = 0, len(lis) - 1
            while left < right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2
                if lis[mid] < book:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid
            # Replace the element at the found position with the current book

    # Return the length of the LIS
    return len(lis)

def minMovesToSortBooks(N, books):
    # Calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence

data = input().split()
N = int(data[0])

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of moves required to sort the books by finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence and subtracting it from the total number of books.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Output:-----
A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 200000$.
- You may also assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs, $1 \leq N \leq 5000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a sequence of books numbered from 1 to N. The key insight was recognizing that the problem could be efficiently solved using the concept of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). The books that are already in the correct order form an increasing subsequence, and the minimum number of moves needed is the total number of books minus the length of this LIS.

The solution involved implementing a function to find the length of the LIS using a binary search approach, which is efficient and works in O(N log N) time complexity. This is crucial given the constraint that N can be as large as 200,000. The binary search helps in maintaining a list that represents the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences of various lengths.

The main challenge was ensuring the LIS calculation was efficient, and the binary search approach was key to achieving this. The solution was tested and passed all provided test cases, confirming its correctness and efficiency. This approach is a useful pattern for similar problems involving sorting or rearranging sequences with minimal operations.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] The problem of sorting books with the minimum number of moves can be efficiently solved by finding the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) in the given sequence of books. The key insight is that the books already in the correct order form an increasing subsequence, and the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of this LIS.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach to find the LIS. It initializes a list `l` where each element starts as 1, representing the minimum length of an increasing subsequence ending at each position.

2. **Nested Loop for LIS Calculation**: The solution iterates over each book and checks all previous books to update the `l` list. If a book can extend a previous increasing subsequence, it updates the length accordingly.

3. **Efficiency Consideration**: The official solution has a time complexity of O(N^2) due to the nested loops. This is less efficient than the O(N log N) approach using binary search, but it is straightforward and works well within the constraints for smaller values of N.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The solution first checks if the array is already sorted, in which case it directly returns 0 moves.

### Reflection:

The official solution is straightforward and easy to understand, especially for those familiar with dynamic programming. However, for larger values of N, the O(N log N) approach using binary search (as implemented in my solution) is more efficient. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different approaches to the LIS problem and choosing the right one based on the problem constraints. The binary search method is particularly useful for large datasets, while the dynamic programming approach is simpler and more intuitive for smaller datasets.

[Problem]
    Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
    He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
    21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
    Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
    12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
    Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
    12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
    Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

    -----Output:-----
    A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq N \leq 200000$.
    - You may also assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs, $1 \leq N \leq 5000$.
