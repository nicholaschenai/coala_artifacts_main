However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.\nHowever, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:\n123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \\, 2 \\, 3 \\quad    1 \\, 3 \\, 2 \\quad     2 \\, 1 \\, 3 \\quad     2 \\, 3 \\, 1 \\quad     3 \\, 1 \\, 2 \\quad     3 \\, 2 \\, 1 \nThe problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, \u2026, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,\u2026,N$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$.\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 10$.\n\n-----Sample input-----\n3 2\n3 1 2\n2 3 1\n\n-----Sample output-----\n3 2 1\n3 1 2\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

For permutations, it means arranging numbers in the order they would appear if sorted.\n\n2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:\n   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair of consecutive elements where the earlier element is smaller than the later one. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.\n   - Swap this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger than it.\n   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position of the first element to get the smallest possible order.\n\n3. **Edge Case**: If the permutation is the last in lexicographic order (i.e., sorted in descending order), the next permutation is the first permutation (i.e., sorted in ascending order).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction next_permutation(perm):\n    n = length of perm\n    i = n - 2\n    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    if i == -1:\n        reverse perm from start to end\n        return perm\n    j = n - 1\n    while perm[j] <= perm[i]:\n        j -= 1\n    swap perm[i] and perm[j]\n    reverse perm from i + 1 to end\n    return perm\n\nread N, K\nfor each permutation in input:\n    result = next_permutation(permutation)\n    print result\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef next_permutation(perm):\n    n = len(perm)\n    i = n - 2\n    \n    # Find the first decreasing element from the end\n    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    \n    if i == -1:\n        # If no such element is found, the permutation is the last one\n        perm.reverse()\n    else:\n        # Find the smallest element larger than perm[i] to the right of i\n        j = n - 1\n        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:\n            j -= 1\n        # Swap elements at i and j\n        perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]\n        # Reverse the sequence from i+1 to end to get the next permutation\n        perm[i + 1:] = reversed(perm[i + 1:])\n    \n    return perm\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    K = int(data[1])\n    \n    index = 2\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(K):\n        permutation = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)\n        results.append(' '.join(map(str, next_perm)))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code reads input from standard input, processes each permutation to find its next lexicographic permutation, and prints the results.

This involved swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum while ensuring the sum does not drop below K.\n\n    One important realization was calculating the maximum and minimum possible values of f(P) for a given N. If K was outside this range, it was impossible to achieve, and the output should be -1. This check helped quickly eliminate impossible cases.\n\n    The solution involved iterating over the permutation and making swaps to adjust the sum. This approach was efficient and worked well within the constraints, as evidenced by the successful test results. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation properties and how to manipulate them to achieve specific outcomes.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem of finding the next lexicographic permutation, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is based on a well-known algorithm for generating the next permutation. Here are some key insights and comparisons:\n\n1. **Algorithm Steps**:\n   - Both solutions identify the first decreasing element from the end of the permutation.\n   - They then find the smallest element larger than this element to the right and swap them.\n   - Finally, they reverse the sequence to the right of the original position to ensure the smallest possible order.\n\n2. **Efficiency**:\n   - Both solutions operate in O(N) time complexity for each permutation, which is efficient given the constraints.\n   - The official solution uses a slightly different approach to find the smallest element larger than the identified element, using a loop to find the minimum directly, whereas my solution uses a while loop to find the first suitable element.\n\n3. **Code Structure**:\n   - The official solution uses helper functions to read input, which can be useful for organizing code, especially in competitive programming settings.\n   - My solution directly processes input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it, which is also efficient but less modular.\n\n4. **Learning Points**:\n   - The core logic for finding the next permutation is consistent across both solutions, reinforcing the importance of understanding this algorithm.\n   - The official solution's use of helper functions for input processing is a good practice for cleaner and more maintainable code.\n\nOverall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively solve it using the standard next permutation algorithm. The experience reinforces the utility of this algorithm in permutation-related problems."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes two integers, N and K, followed by K permutations of N integers each. It processes each permutation to find its next lexicographical permutation using a helper function. If a permutation is the last in lexicographical order, it returns the sorted permutation instead. The function collects the results of these transformations and prints each resulting permutation as a space-separated string.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to generate permutations in a specific order, such as in combinatorial problems, algorithm design, and optimization tasks. Understanding how to find the next permutation in lexicographic order is particularly useful in generating permutations efficiently without generating all permutations at once. This can be applied in problems where permutations need to be processed or analyzed in a specific sequence, such as in scheduling, arranging, or ordering tasks. Additionally, this concept is useful in competitive programming and coding interviews where permutation generation is a common problem."
