## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1
3 1 2

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a number `N` and a number `K`, followed by `K` permutations of the numbers from `1` to `N`. Our task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order for each of these `K` permutations and output them.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in the order they would appear if sorted.

2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:
   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair of consecutive elements where the earlier element is smaller than the later one. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.
   - Swap this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger than it.
   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position of the first element to get the smallest possible order.

3. **Edge Case**: If the permutation is the last in lexicographic order (i.e., sorted in descending order), the next permutation is the first permutation (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

### Pseudocode

```
function next_permutation(perm):
    n = length of perm
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i == -1:
        reverse perm from start to end
        return perm
    j = n - 1
    while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
        j -= 1
    swap perm[i] and perm[j]
    reverse perm from i + 1 to end
    return perm

read N, K
for each permutation in input:
    result = next_permutation(permutation)
    print result
```

### Python Code

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    n = len(perm)
    i = n - 2
    
    # Find the first decreasing element from the end
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    
    if i == -1:
        # If no such element is found, the permutation is the last one
        perm.reverse()
    else:
        # Find the smallest element larger than perm[i] to the right of i
        j = n - 1
        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
            j -= 1
        # Swap elements at i and j
        perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
        # Reverse the sequence from i+1 to end to get the next permutation
        perm[i + 1:] = reversed(perm[i + 1:])
    
    return perm

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    
    index = 2
    results = []
    for _ in range(K):
        permutation = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, next_perm)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads input from standard input, processes each permutation to find its next lexicographic permutation, and prints the results. The `next_permutation` function implements the logic to find the next permutation as described in the conceptual solution.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a sequence of numbers from 1 to N, and we need to find a permutation of these numbers such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair is equal to a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: 
           - For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN), the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair: max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

        2. **Constraints and Observations**:
           - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.
           - The minimum possible value of f(P) is the sum of the smallest N-1 numbers, i.e., 2 + 3 + ... + N.

        3. **Strategy**:
           - Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P) for the given N.
           - If K is greater than this maximum, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.
           - If K is less than the minimum possible value, output -1 because it's impossible to achieve.
           - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

        4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
           - Start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible f(P).
           - Adjust the permutation to decrease the sum to K by swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function find_permutation(N, K):
            max_possible = sum of largest N-1 numbers
            min_possible = sum of smallest N-1 numbers
    
            if K > max_possible or K < min_possible:
                return -1
    
            permutation = list of numbers from N to 1 (descending order)
            current_sum = max_possible
    
            for i from 0 to N-2:
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                for j from N-1 down to i+1:
                    if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                        current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                        swap permutation[i] and permutation[j]
                        break
    
            return permutation
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def find_permutation(N, K):
            # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)
            max_possible = sum(range(2, N + 1))

            min_possible = sum(range(1, N))

                result = find_permutation(N, K)
                if result == -1:

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        This solution efficiently calculates the permutation for each test case by starting with the maximum possible sum and adjusting it to match the desired K.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. The core concept here was understanding the function f(P) and how to manipulate permutations to achieve a specific sum.

    The key strategy was to start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum of maximums, and then adjust it to decrease the sum to the desired K. This involved swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum while ensuring the sum does not drop below K.

    One important realization was calculating the maximum and minimum possible values of f(P) for a given N. If K was outside this range, it was impossible to achieve, and the output should be -1. This check helped quickly eliminate impossible cases.

    The solution involved iterating over the permutation and making swaps to adjust the sum. This approach was efficient and worked well within the constraints, as evidenced by the successful test results. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation properties and how to manipulate them to achieve specific outcomes.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N, and we need to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. The input consists of multiple permutations, and for each permutation, we need to output its next lexicographic permutation.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**:
   - Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in the smallest possible order that is greater than the current permutation.

2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:
   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair where the earlier number is smaller than the later number. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.
   - Swap this number with the smallest number to its right that is larger than it.
   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position to get the smallest possible order.

3. **Steps**:
   - Traverse the permutation from right to left to find the first decreasing element.
   - If no such element is found, the permutation is the last one, and we should return the first permutation (sorted order).
   - Otherwise, find the smallest element larger than this element to the right, swap them, and reverse the sequence to the right.

    if i == -1:
        return perm sorted in ascending order
    j = n - 1
    while perm[j] <= perm[i]:

 ## Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N, and we need to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. The input consists of multiple permutations, and for each permutation, we need to output its next lexicographic permutation.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**:
   - Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in the smallest possible order that is greater than the current permutation.

2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:
   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair where the earlier number is smaller than the later number. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.
   - Swap this number with the smallest number to its right that is larger than it.
   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position to get the smallest possible order.

3. **Steps**:
   - Traverse the permutation from right to left to find the first decreasing element.
   - If no such element is found, the permutation is the last one, and we should return the first permutation (sorted order).
   - Otherwise, find the smallest element larger than this element to the right, swap them, and reverse the sequence to the right.

## Pseudocode

```
function next_permutation(perm):
    n = length of perm
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i == -1:
        return perm sorted in ascending order
    j = n - 1
    while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
        j -= 1
    swap perm[i] and perm[j]
    reverse perm from i + 1 to end
    return perm

function main():
    read N and K
    for each permutation in input:
        result = next_permutation(permutation)
        print result

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find the next lexicographic permutation of a given sequence of numbers. The core concept here is understanding how permutations can be ordered lexicographically, similar to dictionary order, and how to efficiently find the next permutation in this order.

The key strategy involves:
1. Identifying the first pair of numbers from the end where the earlier number is smaller than the later one. This indicates the point where the permutation can be increased.
2. Swapping this number with the smallest number to its right that is larger than it.
3. Reversing the sequence to the right of the original position to ensure the smallest possible order.

This approach efficiently finds the next permutation without generating all permutations, which is crucial given the potential size of the input.

The solution was implemented in Python, using a function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic, and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation algorithms and their applications in combinatorial problems.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem of finding the next lexicographic permutation, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is based on a well-known algorithm for generating the next permutation. Here are some key insights and comparisons:

1. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Both solutions identify the first decreasing element from the end of the permutation.
   - They then find the smallest element larger than this element to the right and swap them.
   - Finally, they reverse the sequence to the right of the original position to ensure the smallest possible order.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - Both solutions operate in O(N) time complexity for each permutation, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The official solution uses a slightly different approach to find the smallest element larger than the identified element, using a loop to find the minimum directly, whereas my solution uses a while loop to find the first suitable element.

3. **Code Structure**:
   - The official solution uses helper functions to read input, which can be useful for organizing code, especially in competitive programming settings.
   - My solution directly processes input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it, which is also efficient but less modular.

4. **Learning Points**:
   - The core logic for finding the next permutation is consistent across both solutions, reinforcing the importance of understanding this algorithm.
   - The official solution's use of helper functions for input processing is a good practice for cleaner and more maintainable code.

Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively solve it using the standard next permutation algorithm. The experience reinforces the utility of this algorithm in permutation-related problems.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the task was to find the next lexicographic permutation of a given sequence of numbers. The core concept here is understanding how permutations can be ordered lexicographically, similar to dictionary order, and how to efficiently find the next permutation in this order.

[Problem]
    It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
    However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
    123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
    The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

    -----Output:-----
    The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
    - $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

    -----Sample input-----
    3 2
    3 1 2
    2 3 1

    -----Sample output-----
    3 2 1
    3 1 2
