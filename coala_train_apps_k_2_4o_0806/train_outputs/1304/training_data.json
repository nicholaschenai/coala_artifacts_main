    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to find the next lexicographic permutation of a given sequence of numbers. The core concept here is understanding how permutations can be ordered lexicographically, similar to dictionary order, and how to efficiently find the next permutation in this order.\n\nThe key strategy involves:\n1. Identifying the first pair of numbers from the end where the earlier number is smaller than the later one. This indicates the point where the permutation can be increased.\n2. Swapping this number with the smallest number to its right that is larger than it.\n3. Reversing the sequence to the right of the original position to ensure the smallest possible order.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the next permutation without generating all permutations, which is crucial given the potential size of the input.\n\nThe solution was implemented in Python, using a function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic, and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation algorithms and their applications in combinatorial problems.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem of finding the next lexicographic permutation, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is based on a well-known algorithm for generating the next permutation. Here are some key insights and comparisons:\n\n1. **Algorithm Steps**:\n   - Both solutions identify the first decreasing element from the end of the permutation.\n   - They then find the smallest element larger than this element to the right and swap them.\n   - Finally, they reverse the sequence to the right of the original position to ensure the smallest possible order.\n\n2. **Efficiency**:\n   - Both solutions operate in O(N) time complexity for each permutation, which is efficient given the constraints.\n   - The official solution uses a slightly different approach to find the smallest element larger than the identified element, using a loop to find the minimum directly, whereas my solution uses a while loop to find the first suitable element.\n\n3. **Code Structure**:\n   - The official solution uses helper functions to read input, which can be useful for organizing code, especially in competitive programming settings.\n   - My solution directly processes input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it, which is also efficient but less modular.\n\n4. **Learning Points**:\n   - The core logic for finding the next permutation is consistent across both solutions, reinforcing the importance of understanding this algorithm.\n   - The official solution's use of helper functions for input processing is a good practice for cleaner and more maintainable code.\n\nOverall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively solve it using the standard next permutation algorithm. The experience reinforces the utility of this algorithm in permutation-related problems.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes two integers, N and K, followed by K permutations of N integers each. It processes each permutation to find its next lexicographical permutation using a helper function. If a permutation is the last in lexicographical order, it returns the sorted permutation instead. The function collects the results of these transformations and prints each resulting permutation as a space-separated string.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to generate permutations in a specific order, such as in combinatorial problems, algorithm design, and optimization tasks. Understanding how to find the next permutation in lexicographic order is particularly useful in generating permutations efficiently without generating all permutations at once. This can be applied in problems where permutations need to be processed or analyzed in a specific sequence, such as in scheduling, arranging, or ordering tasks. Additionally, this concept is useful in competitive programming and coding interviews where permutation generation is a common problem."
