Today, during the morning prayer, all the students are standing in a line. You are given a string $s$ with length $N$; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of this string is 'b' if the $i$-th student in the line is a boy or 'g' if this student is a girl.\nThe awkwardness of this configuration of students is defined as the sum of pairwise distances between each boy and girl. The distance between the $i$-th and $j$-th student in the line is $|i - j|$. Formally, the awkwardness is \u2211i=1N\u2211j=i+1sj\u2260siN(j\u2212i).\u2211i=1N\u2211j=i+1sj\u2260siN(j\u2212i).\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N \\, \\sum\\limits_{j=i+1\\\\ s_j \\neq s_i}^N (j - i)\\,.\nAs the teacher, it is your responsibility to reorder the students in such a way that the awkwardness of the resulting configuration is the smallest possible. You may reorder the students in the line in any way you want. Find the minimum awkwardness that can be achieved.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $s$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum possible awkwardness.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le |s| \\le 10^5$\n- each character of $s$ is either 'b' or 'g'\n- the sum of $|s|$ over all test cases does not exceed $4 \\cdot 10^6$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\ngb\nbgg\nbbgg\n\n-----Example Output-----\n1\n2\n6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: The total awkwardness is $|1 - 0| = 1$, no matter how you arrange the students.\nExample case 2: Initially, the awkwardness is $|1 - 0| + |2 - 0| = 1 + 2 = 3$. However, you can move the boy between the two girls, i.e. choose the configuration \"gbg\". Here, the awkwardness is $|1 - 0| + |2 - 1| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The awkwardness of this line is defined as the sum of the distances between each boy and each girl. Our task is to reorder the students to minimize this awkwardness. We need to determine the minimum possible awkwardness for each test case.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo minimize the awkwardness, we should aim to place all boys together and all girls together. This is because the distance between any boy and any girl is minimized when they are grouped together. The minimum awkwardness can be calculated by multiplying the number of boys by the number of girls, as each boy will have a distance of 1 to each girl when they are adjacent.\n\n### Steps:\n1. For each test case, count the number of boys ('b') and girls ('g') in the string.\n2. Calculate the minimum awkwardness as the product of the number of boys and the number of girls.\n3. Output the result for each test case.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate_minimum_awkwardness(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each string s in test_cases:\n        count_b = count of 'b' in s\n        count_g = count of 'g' in s\n        minimum_awkwardness = count_b * count_g\n        append minimum_awkwardness to results\n    return results\n\nread number of test cases T\nread each test case string into a list test_cases\nresults = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(test_cases)\nfor each result in results:\n    print result\n```\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for s in test_cases:\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_g = s.count('g')\n        # The minimum awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and girls\n        minimum_awkwardness = count_b * count_g\n        results.append(minimum_awkwardness)\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = data[1:T+1]\n    \n    results = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- The `calculate_minimum_awkwardness` function takes a list of test case strings and calculates the minimum awkwardness for each.\n- For each string, it counts the number of 'b's and 'g's, then calculates the product of these counts to determine the minimum awkwardness.\n- The `main` function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results. It uses `sys.stdin.read` for efficient input handling, especially given the constraints."

This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called, which is a common issue when the function is defined but not executed. In competitive programming or script-based environments, the main function or logic should be executed directly to ensure the program runs as expected.\n\n        ### Steps to Fix the Code\n\n        1. **Ensure Execution**: The `solve()` function should be called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed when the script runs.\n\n        2. **Check Input/Output**: Ensure that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()` which is appropriate for reading all input at once in a competitive programming environment.\n\n        3. **Verify Logic**: The logic for calculating the LCM and determining the number of times all groups are on campus together seems correct, but we should ensure that the function is executed to see the results.\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n\n        def lcm(a, b):\n            return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\n        def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n                index += 3\n        \n                # Calculate LCM of x, y, z\n                lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        \n                # Calculate total hours in N days\n                total_hours = 24 * N\n        \n                # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together\n                count = total_hours // lcm_xyz\n        \n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Changes\n\n        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure that the function is executed when the script runs.\n        - **Input/Output Handling**: The input and output handling remains the same, using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and `print()` to output results.\n\n        This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function will now be executed and produce the expected results.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n\n        def lcm(a, b):\n            return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\n        def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n                index += 3\n        \n                # Calculate LCM of x, y, z\n                lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        \n                # Calculate total hours in N days\n                total_hours = 24 * N\n        \n                # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together\n                count = total_hours // lcm_xyz\n        \n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '10', '8 10 6'] Output: 2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with given complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.\n\n    The core concept here was to efficiently update the scores of students over a range of indices and then compute the mean of these scores. The challenge was to handle potentially large input sizes, which required careful management of input reading and processing.\n\n    Initially, the code failed to produce output because the `main()` function was not being called. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by adding a check to call `main()` when the script is executed. This is a common pattern in Python scripts to ensure that the main logic is executed.\n\n    The solution involved:\n    - Initializing an array to store scores for each student.\n    - Iterating over each question and updating the scores for the specified range of students.\n    - Calculating the total score and using floor division to find the mean.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of handling input/output correctly and ensuring that the main logic is executed. It also highlighted the need to efficiently manage operations over potentially large datasets, which is a common requirement in competitive programming.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The formula `b_count * g_count` assumes that each boy is paired with each girl exactly once, but it doesn't account for the fact that the distance between them can be more than 1 if they are not adjacent.\n\n### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n1. **Misunderstanding the Problem**: The solution assumed that the minimum awkwardness is simply the product of the number of boys and girls, which is incorrect. The minimum awkwardness should be calculated based on the optimal arrangement of students, which is not necessarily achieved by simply multiplying the counts.\n\n2. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `b_count * g_count` does not correctly represent the minimum awkwardness. The minimum awkwardness is achieved by arranging all boys together and all girls together, and then calculating the sum of distances between each boy and each girl.\n\n### Correct Approach\n\nTo achieve the minimum awkwardness, we should:\n\n1. **Group All Boys and Girls Together**: Arrange all boys on one side and all girls on the other side (or vice versa).\n\n2. **Calculate Awkwardness**: The minimum awkwardness is the sum of distances between each boy and each girl.

The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()` which is appropriate for reading all input at once in a competitive programming environment.\n\n        3. **Verify Logic**: The logic for calculating the LCM and determining the number of times all groups are on campus together seems correct, but we should ensure that the function is executed to see the results.\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n\n        def lcm(a, b):\n            return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\n        def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n                index += 3\n        \n                # Calculate LCM of x, y, z\n                lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        \n                # Calculate total hours in N days\n                total_hours = 24 * N\n        \n                # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together\n                count = total_hours // lcm_xyz\n        \n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Changes\n\n        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure that the function is executed when the script runs.\n        - **Input/Output Handling**: The input and output handling remains the same, using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and `print()` to output results.\n\n        This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function will now be executed and produce the expected results.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n\n        def lcm(a, b):\n            return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\n        def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n                index += 3\n        \n                # Calculate LCM of x, y, z\n                lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        \n                # Calculate total hours in N days\n                total_hours = 24 * N\n        \n                # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together\n                count = total_hours // lcm_xyz\n        \n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '10', '8 10 6'] Output: 2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the difficulty of problems based on the number of decreases in the number of contestants solving subtasks as the subtask scores increase. The key steps involved sorting subtasks by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers. This required careful handling of input parsing and sorting logic.\n\n    The strategy that worked was to pair scores with contestant numbers, sort these pairs by score, and then iterate through the sorted list to count decreases. The difficulty was then represented as a tuple of the decrease count and the problem index, which was sorted to determine the order of problem difficulty.\n\n    A potential pitfall was ensuring the correct sorting order for the final output, which required sorting by the decrease count in ascending order and by problem index in descending order when counts were equal. This was handled using a custom sort key.\n\n    Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding sorting and tuple manipulation in Python, as well as careful input handling for competitive programming scenarios. The solution was efficient due to the constraints, with a focus on sorting and counting operations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe issue with the current solution is that it incorrectly calculates the minimum awkwardness. The formula `b_count * g_count` assumes that each boy is paired with each girl exactly once, but it doesn't account for the fact that the distance between them can be more than 1 if they are not adjacent.\n\n### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n1. **Misunderstanding the Problem**: The solution assumed that the minimum awkwardness is simply the product of the number of boys and girls, which is incorrect. The minimum awkwardness should be calculated based on the optimal arrangement of students, which is not necessarily achieved by simply multiplying the counts.\n\n2. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `b_count * g_count` does not correctly represent the minimum awkwardness. The minimum awkwardness is achieved by arranging all boys together and all girls together, and then calculating the sum of distances between each boy and each girl.\n\n### Correct Approach\n\nTo achieve the minimum awkwardness, we should:\n\n1. **Group All Boys and Girls Together**: Arrange all boys on one side and all girls on the other side (or vice versa).\n\n2. **Calculate Awkwardness**: The minimum awkwardness is the sum of distances between each boy and each girl.

The minimum awkwardness should be calculated based on the optimal arrangement of students, which is not necessarily achieved by simply multiplying the counts.\n\n2. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `b_count * g_count` does not correctly represent the minimum awkwardness. The minimum awkwardness is achieved by arranging all boys together and all girls together, and then calculating the sum of distances between each boy and each girl.\n\n### Correct Approach\n\nTo achieve the minimum awkwardness, we should:\n\n1. **Group All Boys and Girls Together**: Arrange all boys on one side and all girls on the other side (or vice versa).\n\n2. **Calculate Awkwardness**: The minimum awkwardness is the sum of distances between each boy and each girl. If we place all boys first and then all girls (or vice versa), the distance between each boy and each girl is minimized.\n\n3. **Use the Correct Formula**: The correct formula for minimum awkwardness is the sum of distances between each boy and each girl in the optimal arrangement.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\nLet's revise the solution to correctly calculate the minimum awkwardness by considering the optimal arrangement of students.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    b_count = s.count('b')\n    g_count = s.count('g')\n    # The minimum awkwardness is achieved by placing all boys together and all girls together\n    # The awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and the number of girls\n    return b_count * g_count\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        s = data[i]\n        result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Counting Boys and Girls**: We count the number of 'b's and 'g's in the string. This gives us the number of boys and girls.\n- **Calculating Awkwardness**: The minimum awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and the number of girls, as each boy will be paired with each girl exactly once in the optimal arrangement.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient because counting characters in a string is linear with respect to the length of the string, and we only perform this operation once per test case. Given the constraints, this approach will run efficiently within the limits."

So the manager told  this  to Praveen a student in NITP who suggested them:\n        The first-year students come to campus  every x hour,\n        Second-year students come to campus every y hour,\n        Third-year students come to campus every z hour and \n        Fourth-year is very busy so they don't come regularly.\n        So Praveen being very clever told him the no of times in n days he can have an audience of all year student (1st,2nd & 3rd) at max. So can you code what Praveen has done?\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n        - Each testcase contains of a 2 line of input, first line contain one  integers $N$ (No of Days). \n        -Next line contain 3 space separated integer the  value of x y z\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each testcase, output in a single line answer the no of times audience consists of all year.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n        - $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^8$\n        - $1 \\leq x,y,z \\leq 10^5$\n\n        -----Sample Input:-----\n        1\n        10\n        8 10 6\n\n        -----Sample Output:-----\n        2\n\n        -----EXPLANATION:-----\n        First favourable condition will come on 5th day and Second on 10th day.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        ### Analysis of the Issue\n\n        The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called, which is a common issue when the function is defined but not executed. In competitive programming or script-based environments, the main function or logic should be executed directly to ensure the program runs as expected.\n\n        ### Steps to Fix the Code\n\n        1. **Ensure Execution**: The `solve()` function should be called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed when the script runs.\n\n        2. **Check Input/Output**: Ensure that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()` which is appropriate for reading all input at once in a competitive programming environment.\n\n        3. **Verify Logic**: The logic for calculating the LCM and determining the number of times all groups are on campus together seems correct, but we should ensure that the function is executed to see the results.\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n\n        def lcm(a, b):\n            return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\n        def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n                index += 3\n        \n                # Calculate LCM of x, y, z\n                lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        \n                # Calculate total hours in N days\n                total_hours = 24 * N\n        \n                # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together\n                count = total_hours // lcm_xyz\n        \n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Changes\n\n        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure that the function is executed when the script runs.\n        - **Input/Output Handling**: The input and output handling remains the same, using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and `print()` to output results.\n\n        This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function will now be executed and produce the expected results.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n\n        def lcm(a, b):\n            return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\n        def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n                index += 3\n        \n                # Calculate LCM of x, y, z\n                lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        \n                # Calculate total hours in N days\n                total_hours = 24 * N\n        \n                # Calculate the number of times all groups are on campus together\n                count = total_hours // lcm_xyz\n        \n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '10', '8 10 6'] Output: 2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the difficulty of problems based on the number of decreases in the number of contestants solving subtasks as the subtask scores increase. The key steps involved sorting subtasks by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers. This required careful handling of input parsing and sorting logic.\n\n    The strategy that worked was to pair scores with contestant numbers, sort these pairs by score, and then iterate through the sorted list to count decreases. The difficulty was then represented as a tuple of the decrease count and the problem index, which was sorted to determine the order of problem difficulty.\n\n    A potential pitfall was ensuring the correct sorting order for the final output, which required sorting by the decrease count in ascending order and by problem index in descending order when counts were equal. This was handled using a custom sort key.\n\n    Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding sorting and tuple manipulation in Python, as well as careful input handling for competitive programming scenarios. The solution was efficient due to the constraints, with a focus on sorting and counting operations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The awkwardness is defined as the sum of pairwise distances between each boy and girl. The key insight is that to minimize this awkwardness, we should group all boys together and all girls together, thereby minimizing the distances between them.\n\n#### Initial Misunderstanding\n\nInitially, I misunderstood the problem by assuming that the minimum awkwardness could be calculated simply as the product of the number of boys and girls. This approach failed because it did not account for the actual arrangement of students, which affects the distances between them.\n\n#### Correct Strategy\n\nThe correct strategy is to recognize that the minimum awkwardness is achieved by placing all boys on one side and all girls on the other (or vice versa). This arrangement minimizes the sum of distances between each boy and each girl. The correct formula for calculating the minimum awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and the number of girls, as each boy will be paired with each girl exactly once in this optimal arrangement.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Understanding Problem Constraints**: It's crucial to fully understand the problem constraints and what is being asked. Misinterpreting the problem can lead to incorrect solutions.\n- **Optimal Arrangements**: Recognizing that the optimal arrangement of elements can significantly impact the result is a valuable insight for similar problems.\n- **Iterative Testing**: Testing with various inputs and understanding why certain outputs are expected helps in refining the solution.\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly analyzing the problem and considering different arrangements to achieve the desired outcome."

The optimal arrangement is to group all boys together and all girls together.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution first checks if all students are of the same gender. If so, the awkwardness is zero because there are no boy-girl pairs.\n\n3. **Balancing the Groups**: The solution calculates the difference between the number of boys and girls. It then uses this difference to determine how to balance the groups to minimize the awkwardness.\n\n4. **Mathematical Calculation**: The solution uses a mathematical approach to calculate the minimum awkwardness by considering the number of pairs and their distances.
