    "raw_msg": "Let's address the issue with the previous solution. The problem requires us to minimize the awkwardness by optimally arranging the students. The correct approach is to place all boys together and all girls together, which minimizes the sum of distances between each boy and each girl.\n\nThe minimum awkwardness is calculated as the product of the number of boys and the number of girls, which represents the number of boy-girl pairs when they are grouped together.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    b_count = s.count('b')\n    g_count = s.count('g')\n    # The minimum awkwardness is achieved by placing all boys together and all girls together\n    # The awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and the number of girls\n    return b_count * g_count\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        s = data[i]\n        result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Counting Boys and Girls**: We count the number of 'b's and 'g's in the string. This gives us the number of boys and girls.\n- **Calculating Awkwardness**: The minimum awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and the number of girls, as each boy will be paired with each girl exactly once in the optimal arrangement.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient because counting characters in a string is linear with respect to the length of the string, and we only perform this operation once per test case. Given the constraints, this approach will run efficiently within the limits.",
