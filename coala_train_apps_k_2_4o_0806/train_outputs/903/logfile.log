INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

Kabir wants to see Tara's smile using a mirror placed on the x-axis. Given the coordinates of Kabir and Tara, we need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where the mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The solution should be accurate to within an absolute error of 0.01.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Reflection**: The mirror should be placed such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This means the path from Kabir to the mirror and from the mirror to Tara should be symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

2. **Geometric Insight**: The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula derived from the symmetry of the triangle formed by Kabir, Tara, and the mirror. The formula is:
   \[
   x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that the distances from Kabir to the mirror and from the mirror to Tara are proportional to their respective y-coordinates.

3. **Iterate for Multiple Test Cases**: Since there can be multiple test cases, we need to repeat the calculation for each pair of coordinates provided.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

read T  # number of test cases
for each test case:
    read x1, y1
    read x2, y2
    mirror_x = calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    print mirror_x formatted to 2 decimal places
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the derived formula
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])  # number of test cases
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        x2 = int(data[index + 2])
        y2 = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        
        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror
        mirror_x = calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        
        # Store the result formatted to 2 decimal places
        results.append(f"{mirror_x:.2f}")
    
    # Print all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads input for multiple test cases, calculates the x-coordinate of the mirror for each case using the derived formula, and prints the result formatted to two decimal places.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to find a pair of integers (A, B) for a given integer N such that \(A \oplus B = N\) and \(1 \leq A \leq B \leq N\). The challenge was to efficiently compute the sum of the B values for a range of numbers [L, R] across multiple test cases.

    ### Core Concepts:
    - **XOR Operation**: Understanding how the XOR operation works was crucial. For each bit in the binary representation of N, A and B must differ if the bit is 1, and be the same if the bit is 0.
    - **Iterative Search**: The solution involved iterating over possible values of A and computing B as \(A \oplus N\). The condition \(A \leq B \leq N\) was checked to ensure a valid pair.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Brute Force with Constraints**: Although the problem could potentially involve a large number of computations, the constraints allowed for a straightforward brute force approach within the range [1, N] for each N.
    - **Efficient Input Handling**: Given the large number of test cases, reading input efficiently and processing each test case in a loop was necessary.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def F(N):
        for A in range(1, N + 1):
            B = A ^ N
            if A <= B <= N:
                return B
        return -1

    def G(L, R):
        total = 0
        for i in range(L, R + 1):
            total += F(i)
        return total

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            L = int(data[index])
            R = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = G(L, R)
            results.append(result)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding bitwise operations and efficiently handling large input sizes. The solution was straightforward once the XOR properties were clear, and the iterative approach was sufficient given the constraints.

    Title: Circle-Circle Intersection
    Part: 1/1
    # Circle-Circle Intersection

    You are given two circles on a 2D plane, each one described as coordinates of its center and its radius. Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).

    ## Solution

    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).

    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$

    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$x \cdot (-2x_2) + y \cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$

    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:

    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$

    $$\begin{align}
    A &= -2x_2 \\
    B &= -2y_2 \\
    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2
    \end{align}$$

    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).

    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile. Kabir and Tara are located at given coordinates in a 2D plane. The mirror should be placed such that the line of sight from Kabir to the mirror reflects to Tara. We need to calculate this x-coordinate for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The problem is essentially about finding the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a line from Kabir to the mirror reflects to Tara. This can be solved using the concept of reflection in geometry. The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula derived from the reflection property: 

   \[
   x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}

   This formula is derived from the condition that the angles of incidence and reflection are equal, which is a property of mirrors.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile. Kabir and Tara are located at given coordinates in a 2D plane. The mirror should be placed such that the line of sight from Kabir to the mirror reflects to Tara. We need to calculate this x-coordinate for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The problem is essentially about finding the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a line from Kabir to the mirror reflects to Tara. This can be solved using the concept of reflection in geometry. The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula derived from the reflection property: 

   \[
   x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}
   \]

   This formula is derived from the condition that the angles of incidence and reflection are equal, which is a property of mirrors.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read the number of test cases, T
   For each test case:
       Read the coordinates (x1, y1) for Kabir
       Read the coordinates (x2, y2) for Tara
       Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the formula:
           x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
       Print the x_mirror with a precision of two decimal places
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the reflection formula
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        x2 = int(data[index])
        y2 = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Calculate the mirror position for the current test case
        x_mirror = calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        
        # Store the result formatted to two decimal places
        results.append(f"{x_mirror:.2f}")
    
    # Print all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads input for multiple test cases, calculates the x-coordinate of the mirror for each case using the derived formula, and outputs the result with a precision of two decimal places.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and splits it into a list. This is a valid approach, but we need to ensure that the input is processed correctly.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The `main()` function is defined but not called. This is a common mistake when using functions to encapsulate logic. The function needs to be explicitly called to execute the code.

3. **Output:**
   - The code correctly formats the output to two decimal places using `f"{x_mirror:.2f}"`. However, since the `main()` function is not called, no output is produced.

4. **Execution Environment:**
   - The environment expects the code to read from standard input and write to standard output. The function `main()` should be called to ensure the code executes and produces output.

**Steps to Correct the Code:**

- Ensure the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.
- Verify that the input is processed correctly and matches the expected format.
- Ensure that the output is printed correctly for each test case.

Let's correct the code by calling the `main()` function:

```python
def calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the reflection formula
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        x2 = int(data[index])
        y2 = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Calculate the mirror position for the current test case
        x_mirror = calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        
        # Store the result formatted to two decimal places
        results.append(f"{x_mirror:.2f}")
    
    # Print all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the code
main()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `main()` function is called, which will execute the input reading, processing, and output printing as expected.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Function Call Omission:**
       - Initially, my solution failed because I defined a function but forgot to call it. This is a common oversight when structuring code into functions, especially in competitive programming or environments where the main logic is expected to be executed immediately.

    2. **Input Handling:**
       - Both my solution and the official solution correctly handle input using `sys.stdin.read()` and `input()`, respectively. The choice between these methods depends on the environment and the expected input format.

    3. **Cumulative Score Calculation:**
       - Both solutions maintain cumulative scores for each player and calculate the lead after each round. This is a straightforward approach to track the game's progress and determine the maximum lead.

    4. **Tracking Maximum Lead:**
       - The official solution uses two separate variables (`mlead1` and `mlead2`) to track the maximum lead for each player, which simplifies the final decision on the winner. My solution used a single `max_lead` variable and a `winner` variable, which also works but requires additional logic to determine the winner.

    5. **Efficiency and Clarity:**
       - The official solution is concise and efficient, using a single loop to process input and determine the result. It effectively uses Python's built-in functions like `max()` to simplify the logic.

    In summary, the official solution is a clean and efficient implementation of the problem requirements. It highlights the importance of simplicity and clarity in code, especially when dealing with straightforward logic like cumulative score tracking and lead calculation. This experience reinforces the need to ensure all parts of the code are executed, especially in environments where function calls are not automatically handled.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
      \[
      S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
      \]
      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

    ### Strategy:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_nth_term(N):
        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_nth_term(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile. Kabir and Tara are located at given coordinates in a 2D plane. The mirror should be placed such that the line of sight from Kabir to the mirror reflects to Tara. We need to calculate this x-coordinate for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The problem is essentially about finding the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a line from Kabir to the mirror reflects to Tara. This can be solved using the concept of reflection in geometry. The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula derived from the reflection property: 

   \[
   x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}
   \]

   This formula is derived from the condition that the angles of incidence and reflection are equal, which is a property of mirrors.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read the number of test cases, T
   For each test case:
       Read the coordinates (x1, y1) for Kabir
       Read the coordinates (x2, y2) for Tara
       Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the formula:
           x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
       Print the x_mirror with a precision of two decimal places
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and splits it into a list. This is a valid approach, but we need to ensure that the input is processed correctly.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The `main()` function is defined but not called. This is a common mistake when using functions to encapsulate logic. The function needs to be explicitly called to execute the code.

3. **Output:**
   - The code correctly formats the output to two decimal places using `f"{x_mirror:.2f}"`. However, since the `main()` function is not called, no output is produced.

4. **Execution Environment:**
   - The environment expects the code to read from standard input and write to standard output. The function `main()` should be called to ensure the code executes and produces output.

**Steps to Correct the Code:**

- Ensure the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.
- Verify that the input is processed correctly and matches the expected format.
- Ensure that the output is printed correctly for each test case.

Let's correct the code by calling the `main()` function:

```python
def calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the reflection formula
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        x2 = int(data[index])
        y2 = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Calculate the mirror position for the current test case
        x_mirror = calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        
        # Store the result formatted to two decimal places
        results.append(f"{x_mirror:.2f}")
    
    # Print all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the code
main()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `main()` function is called, which will execute the input reading, processing, and output printing as expected.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile through reflection. The core concept involved using the geometric property of reflection, where the angles of incidence and reflection are equal. This led to the formula:

\[ x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2} \]

The solution required reading multiple test cases, calculating the mirror position for each, and outputting the result with a precision of two decimal places.

Key takeaways from this task include:

1. **Input/Output Handling:** Initially, the function `main()` was not called, which resulted in no output. Ensuring that the main function is executed is crucial when encapsulating logic within functions.

2. **Precision in Output:** The problem required the output to be formatted to two decimal places, which was achieved using Python's formatted string literals.

3. **Reflection Formula:** Understanding and applying the reflection formula was central to solving the problem. This involved basic algebraic manipulation to derive the formula from the geometric properties of reflection.

The final solution involved reading input using `sys.stdin.read`, processing each test case, and printing the results. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] Let's fix the solution by ensuring the `main()` function is called, which will execute the input reading, processing, and output printing as expected. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the reflection formula
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        x2 = int(data[index])
        y2 = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Calculate the mirror position for the current test case
        x_mirror = calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        
        # Store the result formatted to two decimal places
        results.append(f"{x_mirror:.2f}")
    
    # Print all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the code
main()
```

This code will correctly read the input, process each test case, and output the x-coordinate of the mirror with the required precision.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task was to find the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that a line from Kabir to the mirror reflects to Tara. This involves understanding the geometry of reflection and applying it to a 2D coordinate system.

2. **My Approach:**
   - I derived a formula based on the reflection property: 
     \[
     x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}
     \]
   - This formula was implemented in a function, and the main logic was encapsulated in a `main()` function, which was initially not called, leading to no output.

3. **Official Solution:**
   - The official solution uses a different approach by calculating the slope of the line between Kabir and Tara, adjusting for the reflection by negating the y-coordinate of Tara, and then solving for the x-intercept of the line.
   - The formula used in the official solution is derived from the line equation \( y = mx + c \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( c \) is the y-intercept. The x-coordinate of the mirror is found by setting \( y = 0 \) and solving for \( x \).

4. **Key Takeaways:**
   - Both approaches are valid and yield the correct result. The official solution provides an alternative method using line equations, which is a useful technique for similar geometric problems.
   - Ensuring that the main function is called is crucial for executing the code correctly, especially in environments where the script is expected to run from start to finish.
   - Handling input and output correctly is essential, especially when dealing with multiple test cases and formatting requirements.

Overall, this exercise reinforced the importance of understanding geometric properties and translating them into mathematical formulas, as well as the need for careful attention to execution details in coding.
