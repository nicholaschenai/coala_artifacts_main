The core concept here was understanding the function f(P) and how to manipulate permutations to achieve a specific sum.\n\n    The key strategy was to start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum of maximums, and then adjust it to decrease the sum to the desired K. This involved swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum while ensuring the sum does not drop below K.\n\n    One important realization was calculating the maximum and minimum possible values of f(P) for a given N. If K was outside this range, it was impossible to achieve, and the output should be -1. This check helped quickly eliminate impossible cases.\n\n    The solution involved iterating over the permutation and making swaps to adjust the sum. This approach was efficient and worked well within the constraints, as evidenced by the successful test results. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation properties and how to manipulate them to achieve specific outcomes.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here's a breakdown of the key insights and steps:\n\n1. **Mathematical Insight**:\n   - The official solution uses a mathematical approach to calculate the sum of B values directly, without explicitly finding each (A, B) pair for every number in the range. This is achieved by calculating the sum of numbers up to x and then adjusting for the sum of A values.\n\n2. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - The function `GLR(x)` calculates the sum of B values for all numbers from 1 to x. It uses the formula for the sum of the first x natural numbers, \\((x \\times (x + 1)) / 2\\), to get `summation_N`.\n   - It then calculates the sum of A values using a loop that iteratively halves x and accumulates powers of 2, which is a clever way to account for the distribution of A values in the XOR operation.\n\n3. **Range Calculation**:\n   - For a given range [L, R], the solution calculates the result as `GLR(R) - GLR(L-1)`. This effectively uses the inclusion-exclusion principle to get the sum of B values in the range without iterating through each number.\n\n4. **Logarithmic Adjustment**:\n   - The solution adjusts the final result by subtracting the number of bits required to represent the initial number, which is derived using the logarithm function. This accounts for the properties of XOR and ensures the correct sum of B values.\n\nThis approach is significantly more efficient than my initial solution, especially given the constraints, as it avoids the need for nested loops and direct computation of each pair. The use of mathematical properties and efficient summation techniques allows the solution to handle large ranges and multiple test cases swiftly."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers, L and R, and calculates a result using another function. It stores the results for each test case in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to compute a specific function over a range of integers, particularly when the function involves bitwise operations like XOR. The problem involves finding pairs of integers that satisfy certain conditions, which is a common task in combinatorics and number theory. The solution demonstrates how to efficiently iterate over a range and apply a function to each element, which is a useful technique in competitive programming and algorithm design. Additionally, understanding how to handle large input sizes and constraints is crucial for optimizing performance in real-world applications."
