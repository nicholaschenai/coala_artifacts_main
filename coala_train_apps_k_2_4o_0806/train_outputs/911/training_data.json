    "summary": "In tackling the problem of computing the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence over a specified range, the key challenge was efficiently determining the Golomb sequence values for large indices without directly generating the entire sequence. The Golomb sequence is self-describing, where each number n appears exactly G_n times, and is defined by a recurrence relation.\n\n### Core Concepts and Patterns:\n- **Golomb Sequence**: Understanding the self-describing nature of the sequence and its recurrence relation was crucial.\n- **Precomputation**: Precomputing the sequence up to a reasonable limit and maintaining a cumulative count of occurrences allowed for efficient lookups.\n- **Binary Search**: Using binary search on the cumulative count to find the Golomb value for any index was a key strategy.\n\n### Strategies and Fixes:\n- **Initial Mistake**: The initial approach used a flawed binary search logic that directly used Golomb values instead of cumulative counts, leading to incorrect results.\n- **Correct Approach**: By maintaining a cumulative count of occurrences, we could efficiently determine the Golomb value for any index using binary search, ensuring correctness even for large indices.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n```python\ndef precompute_golomb_sequence(limit):\n    golomb = [0] * (limit + 1)\n    golomb[1] = 1\n    cumulative_count = [0] * (limit + 1)\n    cumulative_count[1] = 1\n    for n in range(2, limit + 1):\n        golomb[n] = 1 + golomb[n - golomb[golomb[n-1]]]\n        cumulative_count[n] = cumulative_count[n-1] + golomb[n]\n    return golomb, cumulative_count\n\ndef find_golomb_value(n, cumulative_count):\n    low, high = 1, len(cumulative_count) - 1\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if cumulative_count[mid] < n:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of understanding sequence properties and leveraging precomputation and efficient search techniques to handle large input sizes effectively.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\nThis problem was a great exercise in understanding and efficiently computing the Golomb sequence, especially given the constraints of very large indices. Here are the key insights and learnings from the problem-solving process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Golomb Sequence**: The Golomb sequence is a self-describing sequence where each number n appears exactly G_n times. This property was crucial in understanding how to precompute and use the sequence efficiently.\n\n2. **Precomputation Strategy**: Both my solution and the official solution relied on precomputing the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit. This is essential because directly computing the sequence for very large indices is impractical.\n\n3. **Efficient Lookup with Cumulative Counts**: The official solution uses a cumulative count (`bin_storer`) to efficiently determine the Golomb value for any index. This is similar to my approach but implemented more effectively with a binary search to find the upper bound.\n\n4. **Prefix Sum for Efficient Range Queries**: The official solution precomputes a prefix sum (`prefix_storer`) of the squares of the Golomb sequence values. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of squares over any range [L, R] using the difference of prefix sums. This approach is more efficient than iterating over each index in the range.\n\n5. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: The use of a binary search to find the upper bound in the cumulative count array is a key optimization. It ensures that we can quickly find the Golomb value for any index, which is crucial for handling large input sizes.\n\n### Key Code Snippets\n\n- **Precomputation of Golomb Sequence**:\n  ```python\n  for i in range(2, 10**6 + 100):\n      dp.append(1 + dp[i - dp[dp[i - 1]]])\n      bin_storer.append(dp[-1] + bin_storer[-1])\n      prefix_storer.append((prefix_storer[-1] + (dp[-1] * i * i) % limit) % limit)\n  ```\n\n- **Efficient Range Query**:\n  ```python\n  def fire_query(l, r):\n      return (get_query(r) - get_query(l - 1) + limit) % limit\n  ```\n\n- **Binary Search for Upper Bound**:\n  ```python\n  def find_upper_bound(arr, key):\n      low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1\n      while low <= high:\n          mid = (low + high) // 2\n          if arr[mid] == key:\n              return mid\n          elif arr[mid] > key and mid - 1 >= 0 and arr[mid - 1] < key:\n              return mid\n          elif arr[mid] > key:\n              high = mid - 1\n          else:\n              low = mid + 1\n      return mid\n  ```\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of precomputation and efficient data structures for handling large-scale problems. The official solution's use of prefix sums and binary search for efficient range queries is a valuable technique for similar problems.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data, which includes the number of test cases and pairs of integers (L, R) for each test case. It precomputes the Golomb sequence and cumulative counts up to a specified limit to facilitate efficient queries. For each test case, it calculates the sum of squares of Golomb sequence values between indices L and R, using a helper function to find the appropriate Golomb value for each index. The results for all test cases are stored in a list and then printed. The sum of squares is computed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to compute properties of the Golomb sequence, particularly when dealing with large ranges and multiple queries. The problem involves understanding the self-describing nature of the Golomb sequence and efficiently computing the sum of squares of its terms over a specified range. This is relevant in competitive programming and algorithm design, where optimizing for time and space complexity is crucial due to large input sizes. The use of precomputation and binary search techniques to handle large constraints is a common pattern in such problems."
