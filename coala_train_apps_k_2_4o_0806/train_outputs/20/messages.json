The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.\n\nGildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.\n\nEach customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ \u2014 the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ \u2014 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ \u2014 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.\n\nA customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.\n\nGiven the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $-10^9 \\le m \\le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.\n\nNext, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9$, $-10^9 \\le l_i \\le h_i \\le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.\n\nThe customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n3 0\n5 1 2\n7 3 5\n10 -1 0\n2 12\n5 7 10\n10 16 20\n3 -100\n100 0 0\n100 -50 50\n200 100 100\n1 100\n99 -100 0\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. \n\nIn the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.\n\nIn the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The restaurant's air conditioner can heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. Each customer has a specific time they visit and a temperature range they prefer. We need to check if we can adjust the temperature to be within each customer's preferred range at their visit time.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial temperature and time at 0.\n2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the previous customer (or from time 0 for the first customer).\n3. **Temperature Range Calculation**: Determine the possible temperature range at the customer's visit time by considering the time difference and the ability to change the temperature by 1 degree per minute.\n4. **Check Satisfaction**: For each customer, check if their preferred temperature range overlaps with the possible temperature range at their visit time.\n5. **Update Temperature Range**: Adjust the possible temperature range for the next customer based on the current customer's constraints.\n6. **Output Result**: If all customers can be satisfied, output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read n, m\n        current_time = 0\n        min_temp = max_temp = m\n        \n        for each customer:\n            read t_i, l_i, h_i\n            time_diff = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update possible temperature range\n            min_temp -= time_diff\n            max_temp += time_diff\n            \n            # Check if the customer's range is satisfiable\n            if max_temp < l_i or min_temp > h_i:\n                print \"NO\"\n                break\n            \n            # Update the possible range for the next customer\n            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # Update current time\n            current_time = t_i\n        else:\n            print \"YES\"\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        n, m = test_case[0]\n        customers = test_case[1]\n        \n        current_time = 0\n        min_temp = max_temp = m\n        \n        possible = True\n        for t_i, l_i, h_i in customers:\n            time_diff = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update possible temperature range\n            min_temp -= time_diff\n            max_temp += time_diff\n            \n            # Check if the customer's range is satisfiable\n            if max_temp < l_i or min_temp > h_i:\n                possible = False\n                break\n            \n            # Update the possible range for the next customer\n            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # Update current time\n            current_time = t_i\n        \n        if possible:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nindex = 0\nq = int(data[index])\nindex += 1\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(q):\n    n, m = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n    index += 2\n    customers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        t_i, l_i, h_i = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        customers.append((t_i, l_i, h_i))\n    test_cases.append(((n, m), customers))\n\n# Get results\nresults = can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if all customers can be satisfied by adjusting the temperature within their preferred ranges.

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be made to sum to zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.\n\n    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.\n\n    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.\n\n    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n        \n            sum_A = sum(A)\n            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                k = sum_A // sum_indices\n                possible = True\n                for i in range(N):\n                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                if possible:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Yesterday, Chef found $K$ empty boxes in the cooler and decided to fill them with apples. He ordered $N$ apples, where $N$ is a multiple of $K$. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. \n        Only two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put $K$ apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts $K$ apples in it.\n        Chef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?\n        Note: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n        - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. \n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each test case, print a single line containing the string \"YES\" if the final distributions of apples can be different or \"NO\" if they will be the same (without quotes).\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $1 \\le T \\le 250$\n        - $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^{18}$\n        - $N$ is divisible by $K$\n\n        -----Subtasks-----\n        Subtask #1 (30 points): $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^5$\n        Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n        -----Example Input-----\n        3\n        5 1\n        4 2\n        10 10\n\n        -----Example Output-----\n        NO\n        NO\n        YES\n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        Example case 1: No matter who is hired, all apples will be in the only box at the end.\n        Example case 2: At the end, there will be two apples in each box.\n        Example case 3: If we hire the first candidate, there will be one apple in each box, but if we hire the second one, there will be $10$ apples in one box and none in all other boxes.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        ### Analysis of the Issue\n\n        The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `canDistributionsDiffer()` was defined but never called. In Python, functions need to be explicitly called to execute their code.\n\n        ### Steps to Correct the Code\n\n        1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the function `canDistributionsDiffer()` is called after its definition so that it executes when the script runs.\n\n        2. **Standard Input/Output**: The function is designed to read from standard input and output to standard output, which is correct for competitive programming environments.\n\n        3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: The logic for determining if the distributions can differ is correct. We need to ensure that the function is executed to see the results.\n\n        ### Corrected Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def canDistributionsDiffer():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            index = 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                if K == 1 or K == N:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the function to execute the logic\n        canDistributionsDiffer()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Correction\n\n        - **Function Call**: The function `canDistributionsDiffer()` is now called at the end of the script. This ensures that the logic within the function is executed when the script runs.\n        - **Standard Input/Output**: The function reads from standard input and outputs to standard output, which is appropriate for the problem's requirements.\n\n        This correction should ensure that the code produces the expected output for the given test cases.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's correct the solution by ensuring the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly. Here's the corrected Python code:\n\n        ```python\n        def canDistributionsDiffer():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            index = 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                if K == 1 or K == N:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the function to execute the solution\n        canDistributionsDiffer()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Function Call**: The function `canDistributionsDiffer()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.\n        - **Input Handling**: The input is read and processed correctly using `sys.stdin.read()`.\n        - **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct for producing the expected output.

If it does not, it's impossible to satisfy the customer.\n5. **Update Temperature Range**: Adjust the possible temperature range for the next customer based on the current customer's preferred range and the time available.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction canSatisfyAllCustomers(test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read n, m\n        customers = list of (t_i, l_i, h_i) for each customer\n        current_time = 0\n        min_temp = max_temp = m\n        \n        for each customer in customers:\n            t_i, l_i, h_i = customer\n            time_diff = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update possible temperature range\n            min_temp -= time_diff\n            max_temp += time_diff\n            \n            # Check if the current customer's range is satisfiable\n            if max_temp < l_i or min_temp > h_i:\n                print \"NO\"\n                break\n            \n            # Update the possible temperature range to satisfy the current customer\n            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # Update current time\n            current_time = t_i\n        else:\n            print \"YES\"\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef canSatisfyAllCustomers():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    q = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(q):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        m = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        customers = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            t_i = int(data[index])\n            l_i = int(data[index + 1])\n            h_i = int(data[index + 2])\n            customers.append((t_i, l_i, h_i))\n            index += 3\n        \n        current_time = 0\n        min_temp = max_temp = m\n        possible = True\n        \n        for t_i, l_i, h_i in customers:\n            time_diff = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update possible temperature range\n            min_temp -= time_diff\n            max_temp += time_diff\n            \n            # Check if the current customer's range is satisfiable\n            if max_temp < l_i or min_temp > h_i:\n                possible = False\n                break\n            \n            # Update the possible temperature range to satisfy the current customer\n            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # Update current time\n            current_time = t_i\n        \n        if possible:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ncanSatisfyAllCustomers()\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through each test case, updating the possible temperature range based on the time available and the customer's preferred range, and checks if all customers can be satisfied."

The challenge was to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature using an air conditioner that can heat, cool, or remain off, starting from an initial temperature.\n\nThe successful strategy involved iterating through each customer and calculating the time available to adjust the temperature from the previous customer's visit. For each customer, I updated the possible temperature range based on the time difference and checked if this range could satisfy the customer's preferred temperature range. If the range was not satisfiable, it was immediately determined that not all customers could be satisfied.\n\nA key insight was to maintain a running minimum and maximum possible temperature range that could be achieved by the time each customer arrives. This allowed for efficient checking and updating of the temperature range as each customer was processed.\n\nThe solution was implemented efficiently by reading input data, processing each test case, and outputting results for each case. The use of a loop with a break condition for unsatisfiable scenarios ensured that unnecessary computations were avoided. This approach was effective and passed all test cases without any errors."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, the approach I took was quite similar to the official solution, and both solutions passed the test cases successfully. Here are some key insights and takeaways from the experience:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem required careful tracking of temperature ranges over time, ensuring that each customer's preferred range could be met at their specific arrival time. This involved calculating the possible temperature range at each time step and checking for overlap with the customer's range.\n\n2. **Iterative Range Adjustment**: Both my solution and the official solution used a similar strategy of iteratively adjusting the possible temperature range based on the time elapsed and the customer's requirements. This involved:\n   - Calculating the time difference from the last customer (or from time 0 initially).\n   - Expanding the possible temperature range based on this time difference.\n   - Checking if the customer's preferred range could be satisfied.\n   - Updating the possible range to fit within the customer's range for the next iteration.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient, operating in O(n) time complexity per test case, where n is the number of customers. This is optimal given the constraints, as each customer must be checked exactly once.\n\n4. **Code Structure**: The official solution uses a tuple to track the current possible temperature range, which is a neat way to handle the minimum and maximum temperatures. My solution used separate variables for min and max temperatures, which is functionally equivalent but slightly less concise.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: Both solutions inherently handle edge cases by ensuring that the temperature range is always adjusted to fit within the customer's preferred range, and by checking for any non-overlapping conditions.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of careful range management and iterative updates in scenarios where constraints evolve over time. The official solution was concise and effective, aligning closely with the approach I took."

        "content": "\n[description for function: canSatisfyAllCustomers]\nThe function reads input data to determine if a series of customer temperature requirements can be satisfied over time. It first reads the number of queries and iterates over each query, extracting the number of customers and the initial temperature. For each customer, it checks if the temperature can be adjusted within the given time to meet their minimum and maximum temperature requirements. The function updates the possible temperature range as time progresses and checks if the current customer's requirements can be met. If all customers' requirements in a query can be satisfied, it appends \"YES\" to the results; otherwise, it appends \"NO\". Finally, it prints the results for each query.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a sequence of constraints can be satisfied over time with limited control over the system. Specifically, it applies to situations where you have a dynamic system (like temperature control) that can be adjusted incrementally, and you need to ensure that certain conditions are met at specific times. This could be relevant in scheduling problems, resource allocation, or any situation where you have to manage a system to meet time-based requirements. The problem-solving approach involves calculating the range of possible states (temperatures) over time and checking if these can be adjusted to meet the constraints imposed by each event (customer visit)."
