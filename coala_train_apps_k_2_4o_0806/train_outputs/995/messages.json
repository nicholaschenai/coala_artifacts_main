He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.\nMr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.\nEg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5\nOnly Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.\nEach room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.\n- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.\n- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.\n\n-----Output:-----\nMaximum money obtained.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5\n- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4\n- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100\n- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 1\n3\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n12\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nFor the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. \nThis is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each room is initially locked, and only the two rooms at the ends can be unlocked first. He has a limited number of keys, and each key can unlock one room. Once a room is unlocked, he can unlock its adjacent rooms. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect using the given number of keys.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initial Access**: Mr. Krabs can start unlocking from either the leftmost or the rightmost room.\n2. **Unlocking Strategy**: After unlocking a room, he can only unlock its adjacent rooms.\n3. **Maximizing Money**: To maximize the money, Mr. Krabs should choose the sequence of rooms that yields the highest sum of money with the given number of keys.\n4. **Sliding Window Approach**: Use a sliding window technique to evaluate the maximum sum of money that can be collected by unlocking a contiguous sequence of rooms starting from either end.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize `max_money` to 0.\n2. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the left end.\n3. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the right end.\n4. Use a sliding window to adjust the sum by moving one room from the left end to the right end:\n   - For each possible split of keys between the left and right ends:\n     - Calculate the sum of money by taking some rooms from the left and the rest from the right.\n     - Update `max_money` if the current sum is greater.\n5. Output `max_money`.\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_money(n, A, k):\n    # Initialize the maximum money to 0\n    max_money = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the left\n    left_sum = sum(A[:k])\n    max_money = max(max_money, left_sum)\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the right\n    right_sum = sum(A[-k:])\n    max_money = max(max_money, right_sum)\n    \n    # Use a sliding window to calculate the maximum money obtainable\n    # by taking some rooms from the left and the rest from the right\n    current_left_sum = 0\n    current_right_sum = sum(A[-k:])\n    \n    for i in range(k):\n        current_left_sum += A[i]\n        current_right_sum -= A[n - k + i]\n        current_sum = current_left_sum + current_right_sum\n        max_money = max(max_money, current_sum)\n    \n    return max_money\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nn = int(data[0])\nA = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\nk = int(data[n+1])\n\n# Output the result\nprint(max_money(n, A, k))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We first calculate the sum of the first `k` rooms from both the left and right ends.\n- We then use a sliding window approach to adjust the sum by moving one room from the left end to the right end, updating the maximum sum found.\n- The function `max_money` returns the maximum sum of money that can be collected with the given number of keys."

The core concept was to sort the prices in ascending order and purchase the cheapest chocolates first to maximize the count before exceeding the budget. This approach leverages a greedy algorithm, which is optimal for this type of problem.\n\n    Initially, the function `maxChocolates` was correctly implemented to solve the problem, but the solution failed to produce output because it did not handle input and output correctly. The key issue was not reading from standard input and not printing the result to standard output, which is crucial in competitive programming and similar environments.\n\n    The solution was fixed by adding code to read input using `sys.stdin.read`, parsing the input data, and then calling the function with the parsed values. Finally, the result was printed to standard output. This experience reinforced the importance of handling input/output correctly in coding challenges and the effectiveness of sorting and greedy strategies for optimization problems. \n\n    Here's the final code snippet that worked:\n\n    ```python\n    def maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n        prices.sort()\n        total_spent = 0\n        count = 0\n        for price in prices:\n            if total_spent + price <= k:\n                total_spent += price\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        return count\n\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    prices = list(map(int, data[2:]))\n    result = maxChocolates(n, k, prices)\n    print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding both the algorithmic solution and the environment-specific requirements for input and output handling.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Give me Chocolate\n\n        Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices.\n\n        Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money.\n\n        Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy? \n\n        For example, \n\n        if prices =[1,2,3,4]\n        and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items.\n\n        Input Format\n\n        The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend.\n\n        The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i]\n\n        Constraints\n\n        1<= n <= 105\n\n        1<= k <= 109\n\n        1<= prices[i] <= 109\n\n\n\n        A chocolate can't be bought multiple times.\n\n        Output Format\n\n        An integer that denotes the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy for her.\n\n        Sample Input\n\n        7 50\n\n        1 12 5 111 200 1000 10\n\n        Sample Output\n\n        4\n\n        Explanation\n\n        she can buy only 4 chocolatess at most.
