    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nSalmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold a fixed number of ducks, and each box can contain ducks of at most two different colors. Given the number of ducks of each color, we need to determine how to distribute them into the boxes according to these rules.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors (N), the capacity of each box (K), and the list of duck counts for each color.\n\n2. **Distribution Strategy**:\n   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two different colors.\n   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the capacity is reached or the ducks of that color are exhausted.\n   - If the box is not full, use ducks from the next color.\n   - Repeat this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.\n\n3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks of each color in the box.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N, K\n        read duck_counts\n        \n        initialize a list to store the result for each box\n        \n        while there are ducks left to place:\n            find the color with the most ducks remaining\n            fill the current box with as many ducks of this color as possible\n            if the box is not full:\n                find the next color with the most ducks remaining\n                fill the remaining space in the box with ducks of this color\n            \n            record the colors and counts for the current box in the result list\n        \n        output the result for each box\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case[0]\n        duck_counts = case[1]\n        \n        # List to store the result for each box\n        boxes = []\n        \n        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs\n        ducks = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]\n        \n        # While there are ducks left to place\n        while sum(count for _, count in ducks) > 0:\n            # Sort ducks by count descending\n            ducks.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])\n            \n            # Start filling a new box\n            c1, m1 = ducks[0][0], min(K, ducks[0][1])\n            ducks[0] = (ducks[0][0], ducks[0][1] - m1)\n            \n            if m1 < K:\n                # Need to fill the rest of the box with another color\n                c2, m2 = ducks[1][0], min(K - m1, ducks[1][1])\n                ducks[1] = (ducks[1][0], ducks[1][1] - m2)\n            else:\n                # Box is full with one color\n                c2, m2 = 0, 0\n            \n            # Record the box\n            boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))\n        \n        # Append the result for this test case\n        results.append(boxes)\n    \n    # Output the results\n    for boxes in results:\n        for box in boxes:\n            print(f\"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 1\n# test_cases = [((2, 4), [3, 4, 1])]\n# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes each test case by distributing ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the result for each box. The greedy approach ensures that each box is filled optimally with at most two colors.",
