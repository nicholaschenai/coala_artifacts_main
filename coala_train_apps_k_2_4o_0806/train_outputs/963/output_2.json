This ensures that water can flow optimally to cover all hills.\n- **Traversal Logic**: The code uses a while loop to traverse the list of hills, placing reservoirs at strategic points and skipping over hills that are already covered by the current reservoir.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently determines the minimum number of reservoirs needed by focusing on peaks, ensuring that all hills are covered with minimal reservoir placement.",
