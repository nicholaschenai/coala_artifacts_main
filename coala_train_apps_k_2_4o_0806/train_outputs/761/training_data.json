    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem revolves around optimizing task completion using a set of constraints. The key is to minimize uncompleted tasks by strategically using two types of buttons: white buttons to reduce planned tasks and black buttons to increase completed tasks. The challenge is to apply these buttons optimally across multiple days while respecting the constraints.\n\n#### Strategies and Errors\nInitially, the strategy was to sort the buttons and apply them in a greedy manner: using the largest white buttons and smallest black buttons. However, the logic for applying buttons was flawed, leading to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks, sometimes resulting in negative values.\n\nThe main error was in the order and conditions for applying buttons. The solution needed to ensure that black buttons were applied first to maximize completed tasks before reducing planned tasks with white buttons. Additionally, the logic for removing buttons from the list after use was not correctly implemented, leading to potential reuse of buttons.\n\n#### Fixes and Lessons Learned\nThe solution was corrected by:\n- Ensuring black buttons are applied first to maximize completed tasks.\n- Correctly implementing the removal of buttons from the list after use.\n- Re-evaluating the conditions under which buttons can be applied to ensure they respect the constraints.\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the order of operations and ensuring that constraints are respected in optimization problems. It also reinforced the need for thorough testing to catch logical errors in the application of constraints.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Process\n\nIn this problem, the goal was to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks by optimally using white and black buttons. My initial approach involved sorting and iteratively applying buttons, but it failed due to incorrect logic in button application and calculation of uncompleted tasks.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Unified Button List**: The official solution combines both white and black buttons into a single list (`likm`) and sorts them. This simplifies the process of applying buttons, as it treats all buttons as potential modifiers to the uncompleted tasks.\n\n2. **Difference Calculation**: The solution calculates the difference between planned and completed tasks for each day upfront (`liab`). This allows for a direct focus on reducing these differences using the buttons.\n\n3. **Greedy Approach**: The solution uses a greedy approach by iterating over the sorted differences and applying the largest possible button effect that can reduce the difference to zero or more. This ensures that each button is used optimally to minimize the uncompleted tasks.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: By sorting both the differences and the combined button list, the solution efficiently applies the largest possible button effect to the largest difference, ensuring a minimal sum of uncompleted tasks.\n\n### Why My Approach Failed\n\n- **Incorrect Button Application**: My approach incorrectly handled the application of buttons, leading to negative values for uncompleted tasks.\n- **Complexity in Logic**: The logic for applying buttons was more complex than necessary, leading to errors in the calculation of uncompleted tasks.\n\n### Learning Points\n\n- **Simplification**: Combining the buttons into a single list and sorting them simplifies the logic and reduces potential errors.\n- **Focus on Differences**: Directly working with the differences between planned and completed tasks can streamline the process of minimizing uncompleted tasks.\n- **Greedy Strategy**: A greedy approach, when applied correctly, can effectively solve optimization problems by ensuring that each decision is locally optimal.\n\nThis experience highlights the importance of simplifying problem-solving strategies and focusing on the core objective, which in this case was minimizing the differences between planned and completed tasks.",
