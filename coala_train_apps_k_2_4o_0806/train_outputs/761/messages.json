He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.\nThe good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! \nThe Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.\nPressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.\nPressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.\nChef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?\nBe careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nChef has a schedule of tasks planned over several days. For each day, he has a certain number of tasks planned and a certain number of tasks completed. Chef can use a time machine with two types of buttons: white buttons that reduce the number of planned tasks and black buttons that increase the number of completed tasks. Each button can only be used once, and there are constraints on when they can be used. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks for the day are greater than or equal to the button's value.\n   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks for that day.\n\n2. **Objective**: Minimize the total uncompleted tasks, which is the sum of (planned tasks - completed tasks) for all days.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction in planned tasks.\n   - Sort the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.\n   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce planned tasks.\n   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase completed tasks.\n   - Keep track of the total uncompleted tasks after applying the buttons.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N, K, M\n        read planned_tasks (A)\n        read completed_tasks (B)\n        read white_buttons (C)\n        read black_buttons (D)\n        \n        sort C in descending order\n        sort D in descending order\n        \n        for each day i from 0 to N-1:\n            for each white_button in C:\n                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:\n                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button\n                    remove white_button from C\n                    break\n            \n            for each black_button in D:\n                if completed_tasks[i] + black_button <= planned_tasks[i]:\n                    completed_tasks[i] += black_button\n                    remove black_button from D\n                    break\n        \n        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i] for i in range(N))\n        print total_uncompleted_tasks\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, M = test_case['N'], test_case['K'], test_case['M']\n        planned_tasks = test_case['planned_tasks']\n        completed_tasks = test_case['completed_tasks']\n        white_buttons = sorted(test_case['white_buttons'], reverse=True)\n        black_buttons = sorted(test_case['black_buttons'], reverse=True)\n        \n        # Apply white buttons\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(len(white_buttons)):\n                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_buttons[j]:\n                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_buttons[j]\n                    white_buttons.pop(j)\n                    break\n        \n        # Apply black buttons\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(len(black_buttons)):\n                if completed_tasks[i] + black_buttons[j] <= planned_tasks[i]:\n                    completed_tasks[i] += black_buttons[j]\n                    black_buttons.pop(j)\n                    break\n        \n        # Calculate total uncompleted tasks\n        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i] for i in range(N))\n        results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 1\n# test_cases = [\n#     {\n#         'N': 4,\n#         'K': 2,\n#         'M': 2,\n#         'planned_tasks': [5, 7, 6, 1],\n#         'completed_tasks': [3, 3, 1, 1],\n#         'white_buttons': [6, 3],\n#         'black_buttons': [1, 4]\n#     }\n# ]\n# minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes each test case by applying the buttons optimally, and outputs the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts on the Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring no two consecutive days have the same dish, and the first and last days are different. The key pattern is recognizing that for `N` days, the number of valid schedules can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the choices of dishes on the first, middle, and last days.\n\n    #### Strategy and Formula\n    Initially, the formula used was incorrect for `N > 3`. The correct approach is:\n    - For `N = 2`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n    - For `N = 3`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n    - For `N > 3`, the result should be \\(4 \\times 3^{N-2} \\times 2\\).\n\n    This formula accounts for:\n    - 4 choices for the first day.\n    - \\(3^{N-2}\\) choices for the middle days, ensuring no consecutive days are the same.\n    - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it's different from the first day.\n\n    #### Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the formula for `N > 3`, where the last multiplier was incorrectly set. The correct multiplier should ensure the first and last days are different, which is achieved by multiplying by 2, not 3. The misunderstanding of the expected output for `N = 5` was corrected by applying the correct formula, which results in 240, not 216.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            if N == 2:\n                result = 12\n            else:\n                result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n            results.append(result)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        results = calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly understanding the constraints and requirements of the problem, especially when dealing with large values of `N`.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Scheme? - Too loudly said. Just a new idea. Now Chef is expanding his business. He wants to make some new restaurants in the big city of Lviv. To make his business competitive he should interest customers. Now he knows how. But don't tell anyone -  it is a secret plan. Chef knows four national Ukrainian dishes - salo, borsch, varenyky and galushky. It is too few, of course, but enough for the beginning. Every day in his restaurant will be a dish of the day among these four ones. And dishes of the consecutive days must be different. To make the scheme more refined the dish of the first day and the dish of the last day must be different too. Now he wants his assistant to make schedule for some period. Chef suspects that there is more than one possible schedule. Hence he wants his assistant to prepare all possible plans so that he can choose the best one among them. He asks you for help. At first tell him how many such schedules exist. Since the answer can be large output it modulo 109 + 7, that is, you need to output the remainder of division of the actual answer by 109 + 7.\n\n        -----Input-----\n\n        The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains a single integer N denoting the number of days for which the schedule should be made.\n\n        -----Output-----\n\n        For each test case output a single integer in a separate line, the answer for the corresponding test case.\n\n        -----Constraints-----1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n        2 \u2264 N \u2264 109\n\n        -----Example-----\n        Input:\n        3\n        2\n        3\n        5\n\n        Output:\n        12\n        24\n        240\n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        Case 1. For N = 2 days we have the following 12 schedules:\n        First day Second day  salo   borsch    salo   varenyky    salo   galushky    borsch   salo    borsch   varenyky    borsch   galushky    varenyky   salo    varenyky   borsch    varenyky   galushky    galushky   salo    galushky   borsch    galushky   varenyky  \n\n        Case 2.

Don't be afraid. This time we will not provide you with a table of 240 schedules. The only thing we want to mention here is that apart from the previous two cases schedules for other values of N can have equal dishes (and even must have for N > 4). For example the schedule (salo, borsch, salo, borsch) is a correct schedule for N = 4 while the schedule (varenyky, salo, galushky, verynky, salo) is a correct schedule for N = 5.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        Let's carefully analyze the problem and the solution to identify the mistake.\n\n        ### Problem Analysis\n\n        1. **Understanding the Requirements**:\n           - We have four dishes: salo, borsch, varenyky, and galushky.\n           - For `N` days, we need to create a schedule where:\n             - No two consecutive days have the same dish.\n             - The first and last days have different dishes.\n\n        2. **Pattern Recognition**:\n           - For `N = 2`, the formula correctly gives us \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n           - For `N = 3`, the formula correctly gives us \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n           - For `N = 5`, the expected output is 240, but the formula gives 216.\n\n        ### Error Identification\n\n        The error in the solution is in the calculation for `N > 3`. The formula should account for the fact that the first and last days must be different, which was not correctly handled in the previous formula.\n\n        ### Correcting the Formula\n\n        Upon re-evaluation, the formula should be:\n\n        - For `N = 2`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n        - For `N = 3`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n        - For `N > 3`, the result should be \\(4 \\times 3^{N-1} - 4\\).\n\n        The mistake was in the understanding of the pattern for `N > 3`. The formula should be:\n\n        - \\(4 \\times 3^{N-1} - 4\\) for `N > 2`.\n\n        This accounts for:\n        - 4 choices for the first day.\n        - \\(3^{N-1}\\) choices for the remaining days, but we subtract 4 to account for the cases where the first and last days are the same.\n\n        ### Solution Correction\n\n        Let's correct the code to ensure it uses the correct formula for all `N`.\n\n        ```python\n        def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):\n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                if N == 2:\n                    result = 12\n                else:\n                    result = (4 * pow(3, N-1, MOD) - 4) % MOD\n                results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            results = calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This code should correctly compute the number of valid schedules for each test case, using the corrected formula. The previous misunderstanding was in the expected output for `N = 5`, which should indeed be 240. The code is now corrected to reflect this.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's address the issue with the solution. The formula used in the code was incorrect for `N > 3`. The correct formula for calculating the number of valid schedules should be:\n\n        - For `N = 2`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n        - For `N = 3`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n        - For `N > 3`, the result should be \\(4 \\times 3^{N-2} \\times 2\\).\n\n        The mistake was in the understanding of the pattern for `N > 3`. The formula should be:\n\n        - \\(4 \\times 3^{N-2} \\times 2\\) for `N > 2`.\n\n        This accounts for:\n        - 4 choices for the first day.\n        - \\(3^{N-2}\\) choices for the middle days (each day can be any of the three dishes not used the previous day).\n        - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it's different from the first day.\n\n        Let's correct the code to ensure it uses the correct formula for all `N`.\n\n        ```python\n        def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):\n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                if N == 2:\n                    result = 12\n                else:\n                    result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n                results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            results = calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This code should correctly compute the number of valid schedules for each test case, using the corrected formula.

The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after all days have been processed.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Button Effects**:\n   - White buttons reduce the planned tasks for a day.\n   - Black buttons increase the completed tasks for a day.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.\n   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in ascending order.\n   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce the planned tasks.\n   - Then, use the smallest possible black button to increase the completed tasks.\n   - This approach ensures that we maximize the reduction of uncompleted tasks.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Days**:\n   - For each day, apply the best available white and black button to minimize the uncompleted tasks.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N, K, M\n        read planned_tasks (A)\n        read completed_tasks (B)\n        read white_buttons (C)\n        read black_buttons (D)\n        \n        sort C in descending order\n        sort D in ascending order\n        \n        for each day i from 0 to N-1:\n            for each white_button in C:\n                if A[i] >= white_button:\n                    A[i] -= white_button\n                    remove white_button from C\n                    break\n            \n            for each black_button in D:\n                if B[i] + black_button <= A[i]:\n                    B[i] += black_button\n                    remove black_button from D\n                    break\n        \n        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i from 0 to N-1)\n        print total_uncompleted_tasks\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, M = test_case['N'], test_case['K'], test_case['M']\n        A = test_case['A']\n        B = test_case['B']\n        C = test_case['C']\n        D = test_case['D']\n        \n        # Sort white buttons in descending order\n        C.sort(reverse=True)\n        # Sort black buttons in ascending order\n        D.sort()\n        \n        # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(len(C)):\n                if A[i] >= C[j]:\n                    A[i] -= C[j]\n                    C.pop(j)\n                    break\n        \n        # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(len(D)):\n                if B[i] + D[j] <= A[i]:\n                    B[i] += D[j]\n                    D.pop(j)\n                    break\n        \n        # Calculate total uncompleted tasks\n        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))\n        results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, M = int(data[index]), int(data[index+1]), int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n        index += N\n        B = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n        index += N\n        C = list(map(int, data[index:index+K]))\n        index += K\n        D = list(map(int, data[index:index+M]))\n        index += M\n        \n        test_cases.append({\n            'N': N,\n            'K': K,\n            'M': M,\n            'A': A,\n            'B': B,\n            'C': C,\n            'D': D\n        })\n    \n    minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case by applying the best available buttons to minimize uncompleted tasks, and outputs the result for each test case."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts on the Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring no two consecutive days have the same dish, and the first and last days are different. The key pattern is recognizing that for `N` days, the number of valid schedules can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the choices of dishes on the first, middle, and last days.\n\n    #### Strategy and Formula\n    Initially, the formula used was incorrect for `N > 3`. The correct approach is:\n    - For `N = 2`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n    - For `N = 3`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n    - For `N > 3`, the result should be \\(4 \\times 3^{N-2} \\times 2\\).\n\n    This formula accounts for:\n    - 4 choices for the first day.\n    - \\(3^{N-2}\\) choices for the middle days, ensuring no consecutive days are the same.\n    - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it's different from the first day.\n\n    #### Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the formula for `N > 3`, where the last multiplier was incorrectly set. The correct multiplier should ensure the first and last days are different, which is achieved by multiplying by 2, not 3. The misunderstanding of the expected output for `N = 5` was corrected by applying the correct formula, which results in 240, not 216.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            if N == 2:\n                result = 12\n            else:\n                result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n            results.append(result)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        results = calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly understanding the constraints and requirements of the problem, especially when dealing with large values of `N`.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is straightforward given the problem constraints. The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of problems and a limit on the number of days.\n\n    Key insights from the problem-solving process:\n\n    1. **Total Problems Calculation**: Both solutions start by calculating the total number of problems available by summing up the problems created by each setter. This is a crucial step as it determines the potential number of contests that can be hosted.\n\n    2. **Maximum Contests Calculation**: The next step is to calculate the maximum number of contests that can be hosted by dividing the total number of problems by `K`, the number of problems required per contest. This gives the theoretical maximum number of contests.\n\n    3. **Day Constraint**: The final step is to consider the constraint on the number of days (`D`). The actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of the theoretical maximum contests and `D`.\n\n    The official solution is concise and directly implements these steps in a few lines of code. It uses Python's built-in functions to read input, calculate the necessary values, and output the result efficiently. The use of `min(P, D)` succinctly handles the day constraint, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.\n\n    Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and using simple arithmetic operations to derive the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts on the Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring no two consecutive days have the same dish, and the first and last days are different. The key pattern is recognizing that for `N` days, the number of valid schedules can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the choices of dishes on the first, middle, and last days.\n\n    #### Strategy and Formula\n    Initially, the formula used was incorrect for `N > 3`. The correct approach is:\n    - For `N = 2`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n    - For `N = 3`, the result is \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n    - For `N > 3`, the result should be \\(4 \\times 3^{N-2} \\times 2\\).\n\n    This formula accounts for:\n    - 4 choices for the first day.\n    - \\(3^{N-2}\\) choices for the middle days, ensuring no consecutive days are the same.\n    - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it's different from the first day.\n\n    #### Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the formula for `N > 3`, where the last multiplier was incorrectly set. The correct multiplier should ensure the first and last days are different, which is achieved by multiplying by 2, not 3. The misunderstanding of the expected output for `N = 5` was corrected by applying the correct formula, which results in 240, not 216.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            if N == 2:\n                result = 12\n            else:\n                result = (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n            results.append(result)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        results = calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly understanding the constraints and requirements of the problem, especially when dealing with large values of `N`.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is straightforward given the problem constraints. The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of problems and a limit on the number of days.\n\n    Key insights from the problem-solving process:\n\n    1. **Total Problems Calculation**: Both solutions start by calculating the total number of problems available by summing up the problems created by each setter. This is a crucial step as it determines the potential number of contests that can be hosted.\n\n    2. **Maximum Contests Calculation**: The next step is to calculate the maximum number of contests that can be hosted by dividing the total number of problems by `K`, the number of problems required per contest. This gives the theoretical maximum number of contests.\n\n    3. **Day Constraint**: The final step is to consider the constraint on the number of days (`D`). The actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of the theoretical maximum contests and `D`.\n\n    The official solution is concise and directly implements these steps in a few lines of code. It uses Python's built-in functions to read input, calculate the necessary values, and output the result efficiently. The use of `min(P, D)` succinctly handles the day constraint, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.\n\n    Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and using simple arithmetic operations to derive the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of the theoretical maximum contests and `D`.\n\n    The official solution is concise and directly implements these steps in a few lines of code. It uses Python's built-in functions to read input, calculate the necessary values, and output the result efficiently. The use of `min(P, D)` succinctly handles the day constraint, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.\n\n    Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and using simple arithmetic operations to derive the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The key is to minimize uncompleted tasks by strategically using two types of buttons: white buttons to reduce planned tasks and black buttons to increase completed tasks. The challenge is to apply these buttons optimally across multiple days while respecting the constraints.\n\n#### Strategies and Errors\nInitially, the strategy was to sort the buttons and apply them in a greedy manner: using the largest white buttons and smallest black buttons. However, the logic for applying buttons was flawed, leading to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks, sometimes resulting in negative values.\n\nThe main error was in the order and conditions for applying buttons. The solution needed to ensure that black buttons were applied first to maximize completed tasks before reducing planned tasks with white buttons. Additionally, the logic for removing buttons from the list after use was not correctly implemented, leading to potential reuse of buttons.\n\n#### Fixes and Lessons Learned\nThe solution was corrected by:\n- Ensuring black buttons are applied first to maximize completed tasks.\n- Correctly implementing the removal of buttons from the list after use.\n- Re-evaluating the conditions under which buttons can be applied to ensure they respect the constraints.\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the order of operations and ensuring that constraints are respected in optimization problems. It also reinforced the need for thorough testing to catch logical errors in the application of constraints."

My initial approach involved sorting and iteratively applying buttons, but it failed due to incorrect logic in button application and calculation of uncompleted tasks.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Unified Button List**: The official solution combines both white and black buttons into a single list (`likm`) and sorts them. This simplifies the process of applying buttons, as it treats all buttons as potential modifiers to the uncompleted tasks.\n\n2. **Difference Calculation**: The solution calculates the difference between planned and completed tasks for each day upfront (`liab`). This allows for a direct focus on reducing these differences using the buttons.\n\n3. **Greedy Approach**: The solution uses a greedy approach by iterating over the sorted differences and applying the largest possible button effect that can reduce the difference to zero or more. This ensures that each button is used optimally to minimize the uncompleted tasks.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: By sorting both the differences and the combined button list, the solution efficiently applies the largest possible button effect to the largest difference, ensuring a minimal sum of uncompleted tasks.\n\n### Why My Approach Failed\n\n- **Incorrect Button Application**: My approach incorrectly handled the application of buttons, leading to negative values for uncompleted tasks.\n- **Complexity in Logic**: The logic for applying buttons was more complex than necessary, leading to errors in the calculation of uncompleted tasks.\n\n### Learning Points\n\n- **Simplification**: Combining the buttons into a single list and sorting them simplifies the logic and reduces potential errors.\n- **Focus on Differences**: Directly working with the differences between planned and completed tasks can streamline the process of minimizing uncompleted tasks.\n- **Greedy Strategy**: A greedy approach, when applied correctly, can effectively solve optimization problems by ensuring that each decision is locally optimal.\n\nThis experience highlights the importance of simplifying problem-solving strategies and focusing on the core objective, which in this case was minimizing the differences between planned and completed tasks."
