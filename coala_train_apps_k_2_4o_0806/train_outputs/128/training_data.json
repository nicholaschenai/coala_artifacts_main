    "summary": "In this problem, I implemented a basic calculator to evaluate a simple mathematical expression given as a string. The expression could include non-negative integers, addition (+), subtraction (-), parentheses, and spaces. The challenge was to parse and evaluate the expression without using Python's `eval` function.\n\nThe core concept involved using a stack to manage the order of operations, especially when dealing with nested expressions within parentheses. The stack was used to store intermediate results and signs, allowing us to correctly apply operations as we encountered closing parentheses.\n\nThe solution involved iterating through the string character by character. For digits, I built the current number. For operators, I updated the result with the current number and sign, then reset the number. Parentheses required pushing the current result and sign onto the stack, resetting them for the new sub-expression. Upon encountering a closing parenthesis, I popped from the stack to apply the stored sign and result to the current calculation.\n\nThis approach effectively handled the expression evaluation by maintaining the correct order of operations and respecting parentheses. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the stack-based approach for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.",
    "reflection": "The problem of evaluating a simple mathematical expression string was effectively solved using a stack-based approach. The official solution closely mirrors the approach I took, with a few minor differences in implementation details.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Stack Utilization**: Both solutions use a stack to handle nested expressions within parentheses. This is crucial for maintaining the correct order of operations and handling nested calculations.\n\n2. **Character Handling**: The official solution uses `ord(c) - ord('0')` to convert characters to integers, which is a more explicit way of handling digit conversion compared to using `int(char)`. This approach can be useful in environments where explicit character manipulation is necessary.\n\n3. **Sign Management**: The solution maintains a `sign` variable to track whether the current operation is addition or subtraction. This is updated whenever a '+' or '-' is encountered, ensuring that the current number is added or subtracted correctly.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: After iterating through the string, any remaining number is added to the result. This ensures that the last number in the expression is accounted for, which is a critical step that can be easily overlooked.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and clear, effectively handling all edge cases such as nested parentheses and varying spaces. The use of a stack to manage intermediate results and signs is a robust approach for evaluating expressions with nested operations. This problem reinforces the importance of using data structures like stacks to manage complex state in algorithms.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThe function evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string, which may include integers, addition, subtraction, and parentheses. It uses a stack to handle the nested expressions within parentheses, storing intermediate results and signs. As it iterates through the string, it constructs numbers from consecutive digits and applies the current sign to update the result. When encountering a parenthesis, it saves the current result and sign on the stack and resets them for the new sub-expression. Upon closing a parenthesis, it computes the sub-expression result, applies the saved sign, and adds it to the previous result from the stack. Finally, it returns the computed result of the entire expression.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions programmatically without using built-in evaluation functions like eval. This is particularly relevant in environments where security is a concern, as using eval can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. The solution demonstrates how to handle basic arithmetic operations and parentheses, which are common in many programming tasks such as developing calculators, interpreters, or compilers. Understanding how to manage operator precedence and associativity using a stack is a fundamental concept in computer science, applicable in parsing expressions in various programming languages."
