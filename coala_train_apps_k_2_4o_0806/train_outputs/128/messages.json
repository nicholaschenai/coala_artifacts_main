The expression may include:\n- Non-negative integers\n- The plus `+` and minus `-` operators\n- Parentheses `(` and `)`\n- Spaces, which should be ignored\n\nThe expression is always valid, and we cannot use Python's `eval` function.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a stack to handle the parentheses and maintain the current result and sign. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**: \n   - A stack to keep track of results and signs when encountering parentheses.\n   - A variable `result` to store the current result.\n   - A variable `sign` to store the current sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n   - A variable `i` to iterate through the string.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String**:\n   - If the character is a digit, parse the full number and update the result using the current sign.\n   - If the character is a `+`, set the sign to 1.\n   - If the character is a `-`, set the sign to -1.\n   - If the character is `(`, push the current result and sign onto the stack, then reset `result` to 0 and `sign` to 1.\n   - If the character is `)`, pop the sign and previous result from the stack, and update the current result accordingly.\n   - Ignore spaces.\n\n3. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters, the `result` will contain the evaluated value of the expression.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate(s):\n    initialize stack as empty\n    initialize result as 0\n    initialize sign as 1\n    initialize i as 0\n\n    while i < length of s:\n        if s[i] is a digit:\n            initialize num as 0\n            while i < length of s and s[i] is a digit:\n                num = num * 10 + int(s[i])\n                increment i\n            decrement i\n            result += sign * num\n        else if s[i] is '+':\n            sign = 1\n        else if s[i] is '-':\n            sign = -1\n        else if s[i] is '(':\n            push result onto stack\n            push sign onto stack\n            result = 0\n            sign = 1\n        else if s[i] is ')':\n            pop sign from stack\n            pop previous_result from stack\n            result = previous_result + sign * result\n        increment i\n\n    return result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize a stack to handle parentheses\n        stack = []\n        # Initialize the current result and sign\n        result = 0\n        sign = 1\n        i = 0\n        \n        while i < len(s):\n            char = s[i]\n            \n            if char.isdigit():\n                # If the character is a digit, parse the full number\n                num = 0\n                while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():\n                    num = num * 10 + int(s[i])\n                    i += 1\n                # Adjust for the last increment in the loop\n                i -= 1\n                # Update the result with the current number and sign\n                result += sign * num\n            \n            elif char == '+':\n                # Set the sign to positive\n                sign = 1\n            \n            elif char == '-':\n                # Set the sign to negative\n                sign = -1\n            \n            elif char == '(':\n                # Push the current result and sign onto the stack\n                stack.append(result)\n                stack.append(sign)\n                # Reset result and sign for the new sub-expression\n                result = 0\n                sign = 1\n            \n            elif char == ')':\n                # Pop the sign and previous result from the stack\n                prev_sign = stack.pop()\n                prev_result = stack.pop()\n                # Update the result with the evaluated sub-expression\n                result = prev_result + prev_sign * result\n            \n            # Move to the next character\n            i += 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n"

st.pop();\n        int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n        switch (op) {\n            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;\n            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;\n            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;\n            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int evaluate(string& s) {\n        stack<int> st;\n        stack<char> op;\n        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {\n            if (delim(s[i]))\n                continue;\n        \n            if (s[i] == '(') {\n                op.push('(');\n            } else if (s[i] == ')') {\n                while (op.top() != '(') {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.pop();\n            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {\n                char cur_op = s[i];\n                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.push(cur_op);\n            } else {\n                int number = 0;\n                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))\n                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';\n                --i;\n                st.push(number);\n            }\n        }\n\n        while (!op.empty()) {\n            process_op(st, op.top());\n            op.pop();\n        }\n        return st.top();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.\n    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.\n\n    ## Unary operators\n\n    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).\n    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.\n\n    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.\n\n    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).\n    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.\n    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. \n\n    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.\n    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.\n\n    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.\n\n    ## Right-associativity\n\n    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.\n\n    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.\n    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \\wedge b \\wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).\n\n    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?\n    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.\n    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.\n\n    The only line that needs to be replaced is\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))\n    ```\n    with\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && (\n            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||\n            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))\n        ))\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Expression parsing\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n    where `left_assoc` is a function that decides if an operator is left_associative or not.\n\n    Here is an implementation for the binary operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$ and the unary  operators $+$ and $-$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_unary}\n    bool delim(char c) {\n        return c == ' ';\n    }\n\n    bool is_op(char c) {\n        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';\n    }\n\n    bool is_unary(char c) {\n        return c == '+' || c=='-';\n    }\n\n    int priority (char op) {\n        if (op < 0) // unary operator\n            return 3;\n        if (op == '+' || op == '-')\n            return 1;\n        if (op == '*' || op == '/')\n            return 2;\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {\n        if (op < 0) {\n            int l = st.top();

At the end of the iteration, the stack will contain the result of the expression.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a stack to store numbers and results\n   Initialize a variable to store the current number\n   Initialize a variable to store the current sign (1 for +, -1 for -)\n   Initialize a result variable to 0\n\n   Iterate over each character in the string:\n       If the character is a digit:\n           Update the current number by appending the digit\n       If the character is a '+' or '-':\n           Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result\n           Update the sign based on the character\n           Reset the current number to 0\n       If the character is '(':\n           Push the current result and sign onto the stack\n           Reset the result to 0 and sign to 1\n       If the character is ')':\n           Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result\n           Pop the sign and previous result from the stack\n           Update the result by multiplying with the popped sign and adding the popped result\n           Reset the current number to 0\n       Ignore spaces\n\n   After the loop, add the last number multiplied by the current sign to the result\n\n   Return the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize a stack to store results and signs\n        stack = []\n        # Initialize the current number and result\n        current_number = 0\n        result = 0\n        # Initialize the current sign (1 for +, -1 for -)\n        sign = 1\n        \n        # Iterate over each character in the string\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                # Build the current number\n                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)\n            elif char in '+-':\n                # Add the current number to the result with the current sign\n                result += sign * current_number\n                # Update the sign\n                sign = 1 if char == '+' else -1\n                # Reset the current number\n                current_number = 0\n            elif char == '(':\n                # Push the current result and sign onto the stack\n                stack.append(result)\n                stack.append(sign)\n                # Reset the result and sign\n                result = 0\n                sign = 1\n            elif char == ')':\n                # Add the current number to the result with the current sign\n                result += sign * current_number\n                # Pop the sign and previous result from the stack\n                result *= stack.pop()  # This is the sign\n                result += stack.pop()  # This is the previous result\n                # Reset the current number\n                current_number = 0\n        \n        # Add the last number to the result\n        result += sign * current_number\n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution uses a stack to handle nested expressions and ensures that operations are performed in the correct order, respecting parentheses and operator precedence."

The expression could include non-negative integers, addition (+), subtraction (-), parentheses, and spaces. The challenge was to parse and evaluate the expression without using Python's `eval` function.\n\nThe core concept involved using a stack to manage the order of operations, especially when dealing with nested expressions within parentheses. The stack was used to store intermediate results and signs, allowing us to correctly apply operations as we encountered closing parentheses.\n\nThe solution involved iterating through the string character by character. For digits, I built the current number. For operators, I updated the result with the current number and sign, then reset the number. Parentheses required pushing the current result and sign onto the stack, resetting them for the new sub-expression. Upon encountering a closing parenthesis, I popped from the stack to apply the stored sign and result to the current calculation.\n\nThis approach effectively handled the expression evaluation by maintaining the correct order of operations and respecting parentheses. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the stack-based approach for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions."

        "content": "The problem of evaluating a simple mathematical expression string was effectively solved using a stack-based approach. The official solution closely mirrors the approach I took, with a few minor differences in implementation details.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Stack Utilization**: Both solutions use a stack to handle nested expressions within parentheses. This is crucial for maintaining the correct order of operations and handling nested calculations.\n\n2. **Character Handling**: The official solution uses `ord(c) - ord('0')` to convert characters to integers, which is a more explicit way of handling digit conversion compared to using `int(char)`. This approach can be useful in environments where explicit character manipulation is necessary.\n\n3. **Sign Management**: The solution maintains a `sign` variable to track whether the current operation is addition or subtraction. This is updated whenever a '+' or '-' is encountered, ensuring that the current number is added or subtracted correctly.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: After iterating through the string, any remaining number is added to the result. This ensures that the last number in the expression is accounted for, which is a critical step that can be easily overlooked.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and clear, effectively handling all edge cases such as nested parentheses and varying spaces. The use of a stack to manage intermediate results and signs is a robust approach for evaluating expressions with nested operations. This problem reinforces the importance of using data structures like stacks to manage complex state in algorithms."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThe function evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string, which may include integers, addition, subtraction, and parentheses. It uses a stack to handle the nested expressions within parentheses, storing intermediate results and signs. As it iterates through the string, it constructs numbers from consecutive digits and applies the current sign to update the result. When encountering a parenthesis, it saves the current result and sign on the stack and resets them for the new sub-expression. Upon closing a parenthesis, it computes the sub-expression result, applies the saved sign, and adds it to the previous result from the stack. Finally, it returns the computed result of the entire expression.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions programmatically without using built-in evaluation functions like eval. This is particularly relevant in environments where security is a concern, as using eval can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. The solution demonstrates how to handle basic arithmetic operations and parentheses, which are common in many programming tasks such as developing calculators, interpreters, or compilers. Understanding how to manage operator precedence and associativity using a stack is a fundamental concept in computer science, applicable in parsing expressions in various programming languages."
