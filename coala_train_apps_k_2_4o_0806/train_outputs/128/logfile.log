INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to implement a basic calculator that can evaluate a simple arithmetic expression given as a string. The expression may include:
- Non-negative integers
- The plus `+` and minus `-` operators
- Parentheses `(` and `)`
- Spaces, which should be ignored

The expression is always valid, and we cannot use Python's `eval` function.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a stack to handle the parentheses and maintain the current result and sign. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize Variables**: 
   - A stack to keep track of results and signs when encountering parentheses.
   - A variable `result` to store the current result.
   - A variable `sign` to store the current sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative).
   - A variable `i` to iterate through the string.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - If the character is a digit, parse the full number and update the result using the current sign.
   - If the character is a `+`, set the sign to 1.
   - If the character is a `-`, set the sign to -1.
   - If the character is `(`, push the current result and sign onto the stack, then reset `result` to 0 and `sign` to 1.
   - If the character is `)`, pop the sign and previous result from the stack, and update the current result accordingly.
   - Ignore spaces.

3. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters, the `result` will contain the evaluated value of the expression.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate(s):
    initialize stack as empty
    initialize result as 0
    initialize sign as 1
    initialize i as 0

    while i < length of s:
        if s[i] is a digit:
            initialize num as 0
            while i < length of s and s[i] is a digit:
                num = num * 10 + int(s[i])
                increment i
            decrement i
            result += sign * num
        else if s[i] is '+':
            sign = 1
        else if s[i] is '-':
            sign = -1
        else if s[i] is '(':
            push result onto stack
            push sign onto stack
            result = 0
            sign = 1
        else if s[i] is ')':
            pop sign from stack
            pop previous_result from stack
            result = previous_result + sign * result
        increment i

    return result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Initialize a stack to handle parentheses
        stack = []
        # Initialize the current result and sign
        result = 0
        sign = 1
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            char = s[i]
            
            if char.isdigit():
                # If the character is a digit, parse the full number
                num = 0
                while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():
                    num = num * 10 + int(s[i])
                    i += 1
                # Adjust for the last increment in the loop
                i -= 1
                # Update the result with the current number and sign
                result += sign * num
            
            elif char == '+':
                # Set the sign to positive
                sign = 1
            
            elif char == '-':
                # Set the sign to negative
                sign = -1
            
            elif char == '(':
                # Push the current result and sign onto the stack
                stack.append(result)
                stack.append(sign)
                # Reset result and sign for the new sub-expression
                result = 0
                sign = 1
            
            elif char == ')':

            # Move to the next character
            i += 1

    # Expression parsing

    A string containing a mathematical expression containing numbers and various operators is given.
    We have to compute the value of it in $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.

    The algorithm discussed here translates an expression into the so-called **reverse Polish notation** (explicitly or implicitly), and evaluates this expression.

    ## Reverse Polish notation

    The reverse Polish notation is a form of writing mathematical expressions, in which the operators are located after their operands.
    For example the following expression

    $$a + b * c * d + (e - f) * (g * h + i)$$

    can be written in reverse Polish notation in the following way:

    $$a b c * d * + e f - g h * i + * +$$

    The reverse Polish notation was developed by the Australian philosopher and computer science specialist Charles Hamblin in the mid 1950s on the basis of the Polish notation, which was proposed in 1920 by the Polish mathematician Jan Łukasiewicz.

    The convenience of the reverse Polish notation is, that expressions in this form are very **easy to evaluate** in linear time.
    We use a stack, which is initially empty.
    We will iterate over the operands and operators of the expression in reverse Polish notation.
    If the current element is a number, then we put the value on top of the stack, if the current element is an operator, then we get the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and put the result back on top of the stack.
    In the end there will be exactly one element left in the stack, which will be the value of the expression.

    Obviously this simple evaluation runs in $O(n)$ time.

    ## Parsing of simple expressions

    For the time being we only consider a simplified problem:
    we assume that all operators are **binary** (i.e. they take two arguments), and all are **left-associative** (if the priorities are equal, they get executed from left to right).
    Parentheses are allowed.

    We will set up two stacks: one for numbers, and one for operators and parentheses.
    Initially both stacks are empty.
    For the second stack we will maintain the condition that all operations are ordered by strict descending priority.
    If there are parenthesis on the stack, than each block of operators (corresponding to one pair of parenthesis) is ordered, and the entire stack is not necessarily ordered.

    We will iterate over the characters of the expression from left to right.
    If the current character is a digit, then we put the value of this number on the stack.
    If the current character is an opening parenthesis, then we put it on the stack.
    If the current character is a closing parenthesis, the we execute all operators on the stack until we reach the opening bracket (in other words we perform all operations inside the parenthesis).
    Finally if the current character is an operator, then while the top of the stack has an operator with the same or higher priority, we will execute this operation, and put the new operation on the stack.

    After we processed the entire string, some operators might still be in the stack, so we execute them.

    Here is the implementation of this method for the four operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$:

    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_simple}
    bool delim(char c) {
        return c == ' ';
    }

    bool is_op(char c) {
        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';
    }

    int priority (char op) {
        if (op == '+' || op == '-')
            return 1;
        if (op == '*' || op == '/')
            return 2;
        return -1;
    }

    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {
        int r = st.top(); st.pop();
        int l = st.top(); st.pop();
        switch (op) {
            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;
            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;
            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;
            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;
        }
    }

    int evaluate(string& s) {
        stack<int> st;
        stack<char> op;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {
            if (delim(s[i]))
                continue;
        
            if (s[i] == '(') {
                op.push('(');
            } else if (s[i] == ')') {
                while (op.top() != '(') {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.pop();
            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {
                char cur_op = s[i];
                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.push(cur_op);
            } else {
                int number = 0;
                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))
                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';
                --i;
                st.push(number);
            }
        }

        while (!op.empty()) {
            process_op(st, op.top());
            op.pop();
        }
        return st.top();
    }
    ```

    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.
    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.

    ## Unary operators

    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).
    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.

    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.

    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).
    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.
    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. 

    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.
    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.

    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.

    ## Right-associativity

    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.

    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.
    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \wedge b \wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).

    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?
    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.
    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.

    The only line that needs to be replaced is
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))
    ```
    with
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && (
            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||
            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))
        ))

INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string. The expression can include non-negative integers, addition (+), subtraction (-), parentheses, and spaces. The function should return the result of the expression as an integer. We cannot use Python's `eval` function.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to handle the operations and parentheses. We will iterate through the string character by character. When we encounter a number, we will parse it and push it onto a stack. When we encounter an operator (+ or -), we will apply it to the top of the stack. Parentheses will be used to manage the order of operations by using a secondary stack to store intermediate results and operators. Spaces will be ignored. At the end of the iteration, the stack will contain the result of the expression.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a stack to store numbers and results
   Initialize a variable to store the current number
   Initialize a variable to store the current sign (1 for +, -1 for -)
   Initialize a result variable to 0

   Iterate over each character in the string:
       If the character is a digit:
           Update the current number by appending the digit
       If the character is a '+' or '-':
           Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result
           Update the sign based on the character
           Reset the current number to 0
       If the character is '(':
           Push the current result and sign onto the stack
           Reset the result to 0 and sign to 1
       If the character is ')':
           Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result
           Pop the sign and previous result from the stack
           Update the result by multiplying with the popped sign and adding the popped result
           Reset the current number to 0
       Ignore spaces

   After the loop, add the last number multiplied by the current sign to the result

   Return the result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**

    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Initialize a stack to store results and signs
        stack = []

        current_number = 0
        result = 0
        # Initialize the current sign (1 for +, -1 for -)
        sign = 1
        
        # Iterate over each character in the string
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # Build the current number
                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char in '+-':
                # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                result += sign * current_number
                # Update the sign
                sign = 1 if char == '+' else -1
                # Reset the current number
                current_number = 0
            elif char == '(':
                # Push the current result and sign onto the stack
                stack.append(result)
                stack.append(sign)
                # Reset the result and sign
                result = 0
                sign = 1
            elif char == ')':
                # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                result += sign * current_number
                # Pop the sign and previous result from the stack
                result *= stack.pop()  # This is the sign
                result += stack.pop()  # This is the previous result
                # Reset the current number
                current_number = 0
        
        # Add the last number to the result
        result += sign * current_number
        return result
```

This solution uses a stack to handle nested expressions and ensures that operations are performed in the correct order, respecting parentheses and operator precedence.

INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] In this problem, I implemented a basic calculator to evaluate a simple mathematical expression given as a string. The expression could include non-negative integers, addition (+), subtraction (-), parentheses, and spaces. The challenge was to parse and evaluate the expression without using Python's `eval` function.

The core concept involved using a stack to manage the order of operations, especially when dealing with nested expressions within parentheses. The stack was used to store intermediate results and signs, allowing us to correctly apply operations as we encountered closing parentheses.

The solution involved iterating through the string character by character. For digits, I built the current number. For operators, I updated the result with the current number and sign, then reset the number. Parentheses required pushing the current result and sign onto the stack, resetting them for the new sub-expression. Upon encountering a closing parenthesis, I popped from the stack to apply the stored sign and result to the current calculation.

This approach effectively handled the expression evaluation by maintaining the correct order of operations and respecting parentheses. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the stack-based approach for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 128 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string. The expression can include non-negative integers, addition (+), subtraction (-), parentheses, and spaces. The function should return the result of the expression as an integer. We cannot use Python's `eval` function.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to handle the operations and parentheses. We will iterate through the string character by character. When we encounter a number, we will parse it and push it onto a stack. When we encounter an operator (+ or -), we will apply it to the top of the stack. Parentheses will be used to manage the order of operations by using a secondary stack to store intermediate results and operators. Spaces will be ignored. At the end of the iteration, the stack will contain the result of the expression.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a stack to store numbers and results
   Initialize a variable to store the current number
   Initialize a variable to store the current sign (1 for +, -1 for -)
   Initialize a result variable to 0

   Iterate over each character in the string:
       If the character is a digit:
           Update the current number by appending the digit
       If the character is a '+' or '-':
           Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result
           Update the sign based on the character
           Reset the current number to 0
       If the character is '(':
           Push the current result and sign onto the stack
           Reset the result to 0 and sign to 1
       If the character is ')':
           Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result
           Pop the sign and previous result from the stack
           Update the result by multiplying with the popped sign and adding the popped result
           Reset the current number to 0
       Ignore spaces

   After the loop, add the last number multiplied by the current sign to the result

   Return the result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Initialize a stack to store results and signs
        stack = []
        # Initialize the current number and result
        current_number = 0
        result = 0
        # Initialize the current sign (1 for +, -1 for -)
        sign = 1
        
        # Iterate over each character in the string
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # Build the current number
                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char in '+-':
                # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                result += sign * current_number
                # Update the sign
                sign = 1 if char == '+' else -1
                # Reset the current number
                current_number = 0
            elif char == '(':
                # Push the current result and sign onto the stack
                stack.append(result)
                stack.append(sign)
                # Reset the result and sign
                result = 0
                sign = 1
            elif char == ')':
                # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                result += sign * current_number
                # Pop the sign and previous result from the stack
                result *= stack.pop()  # This is the sign
                result += stack.pop()  # This is the previous result
                # Reset the current number
                current_number = 0
        
        # Add the last number to the result
        result += sign * current_number
        return result
```

This solution uses a stack to handle nested expressions and ensures that operations are performed in the correct order, respecting parentheses and operator precedence.

INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] The problem of evaluating a simple mathematical expression string was effectively solved using a stack-based approach. The official solution closely mirrors the approach I took, with a few minor differences in implementation details.

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Stack Utilization**: Both solutions use a stack to handle nested expressions within parentheses. This is crucial for maintaining the correct order of operations and handling nested calculations.

2. **Character Handling**: The official solution uses `ord(c) - ord('0')` to convert characters to integers, which is a more explicit way of handling digit conversion compared to using `int(char)`. This approach can be useful in environments where explicit character manipulation is necessary.

3. **Sign Management**: The solution maintains a `sign` variable to track whether the current operation is addition or subtraction. This is updated whenever a '+' or '-' is encountered, ensuring that the current number is added or subtracted correctly.

4. **Final Calculation**: After iterating through the string, any remaining number is added to the result. This ensures that the last number in the expression is accounted for, which is a critical step that can be easily overlooked.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and clear, effectively handling all edge cases such as nested parentheses and varying spaces. The use of a stack to manage intermediate results and signs is a robust approach for evaluating expressions with nested operations. This problem reinforces the importance of using data structures like stacks to manage complex state in algorithms.

It uses a stack to handle the nested expressions within parentheses, storing intermediate results and signs. As it iterates through the string, it constructs numbers from consecutive digits and applies the current sign to update the result. When encountering a parenthesis, it saves the current result and sign on the stack and resets them for the new sub-expression. Upon closing a parenthesis, it computes the sub-expression result, applies the saved sign, and adds it to the previous result from the stack.
