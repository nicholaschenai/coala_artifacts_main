INFO - [Task id] 583 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of integers, and we want to determine if it's possible to make the sum of the sequence equal to zero by performing a series of operations. In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence "good" (i.e., sum to zero) for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operation**: For each element `A[i]` in the sequence, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

2. **Sum of the Sequence**: The goal is to make the sum of the sequence zero. If the initial sum of the sequence is `S`, we need to determine if we can adjust the sequence such that the sum becomes zero.

3. **Feasibility Check**: 
   - For each index `i`, we can reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`. 
   - Therefore, the sum `S` can be adjusted by any combination of `i` values.
   - The key observation is that if the sum of the sequence `S` is divisible by the sum of indices `1 + 2 + ... + N`, then it is possible to make the sequence good.

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Calculate the sum of the sequence `S`.
   - Calculate the sum of indices `1 + 2 + ... + N`, which is `N * (N + 1) / 2`.
   - Check if `S` is divisible by this sum of indices. If it is, output "YES", otherwise "NO".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        # Calculate the sum of the sequence
        sum_A = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the sum of indices 1 to N
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2
        
        # Check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Example usage:
# T = 2
# test_cases = [
#     (1, [-1]),
#     (2, [1, 2])
# ]
# is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices. It then checks if the sequence sum is divisible by the sum of indices to determine if the sequence can be made good.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. The core concept here was understanding the function f(P) and how to manipulate permutations to achieve a specific sum.

    The key strategy was to start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum of maximums, and then adjust it to decrease the sum to the desired K. This involved swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum while ensuring the sum does not drop below K.

    One important realization was calculating the maximum and minimum possible values of f(P) for a given N. If K was outside this range, it was impossible to achieve, and the output should be -1. This check helped quickly eliminate impossible cases.

    The solution involved iterating over the permutation and making swaps to adjust the sum. This approach was efficient and worked well within the constraints, as evidenced by the successful test results. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation properties and how to manipulate them to achieve specific outcomes.

We have a sequence of integers, and we want to determine if it's possible to make the sum of the sequence equal to zero by performing a series of operations. In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence "good" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to adjust each element by multiples of its index. Therefore, the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices. 

3. **Feasibility Check**: To make the sequence sum to zero, the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, we can perform operations to adjust the sequence to zero; otherwise, it's impossible.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the sum of the sequence.
   - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.
   - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.
   - If it is, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.
You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the given sequence good or "NO" if it is impossible.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10$
- $|A_i| \le 100$ for each valid $i$

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of integers, and we want to determine if it's possible to make the sum of the sequence equal to zero by performing a series of operations. In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence "good" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to adjust each element by multiples of its index. Therefore, the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices. 

3. **Feasibility Check**: To make the sequence sum to zero, the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, we can perform operations to adjust the sequence to zero; otherwise, it's impossible.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the sum of the sequence.
   - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.
   - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.
   - If it is, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case.N
        A = test_case.A
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if the sequence can be made "good" by verifying if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero; otherwise, it cannot.

INFO - [Task id] 583 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Function Call**: The function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that involve reading from standard input and output. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, the function needs to be called to process the input.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct. However, since the function is not called, no output is generated.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is called after its definition to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is correctly parsed and processed. The current logic for reading and processing input seems correct, but it needs to be executed.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly. The current logic appends results to a list and prints them, which is correct.

### Corrected Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the solution
is_good_sequence_possible()
```

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read and processed correctly using `sys.stdin.read()`.
- **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct for producing the expected output.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Pattern Generation Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating a specific pattern based on an integer \( K \) for multiple test cases. Each test case requires generating \( K \) lines, where each line \( i \) consists of numbers starting from \( i \) down to 0, followed by numbers from 1 up to \( i \). The challenge is to ensure that the output for each test case is formatted correctly, with each test case's output separated by a blank line.

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the approach was to generate and print each line of the pattern directly within the `generate_pattern` function. However, this led to issues with output formatting, particularly with extra or missing lines between test cases. The key mistake was not managing the separation between test cases correctly, which resulted in incorrect output.

    #### Fixes and Final Solution
    The solution was refined by collecting the results for each test case in a list and then joining these results with a double newline (`\n\n`) to ensure proper separation between test cases. This approach ensures that each test case's output is printed consecutively, with a blank line between different test cases, but no extra blank lines at the end. This adjustment resolved the formatting issues and produced the expected output.

    #### Final Code Snippet
    ```python
    def generate_pattern(K):
        for i in range(K):
            line = []
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line.append(str(j))
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line.append(str(j))
            print("".join(line))

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().strip().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for test_case in range(T):
            K = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            result = []
            for i in range(K):
                line = []
                for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                    line.append(str(j))
                for j in range(1, i + 1):
                    line.append(str(j))
                result.append("".join(line))
            results.append("\n".join(result))
    
        print("\n\n".join(results))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing output formatting, especially when dealing with multiple test cases and ensuring that the output matches the expected format precisely.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.
You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the given sequence good or "NO" if it is impossible.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10$
- $|A_i| \le 100$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (10 points): $N = 1$
Subtask #2 (30 points): $N \le 2$
Subtask #3 (60 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
1
-1
2
1 2

-----Example Output-----
NO
YES

-----Explanation-----
Example case 2: We can perform two operations â€• subtract $1$ from $A_1$ and $2$ from $A_2$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of integers, and we want to determine if it's possible to make the sum of the sequence equal to zero by performing a series of operations. In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence "good" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to adjust each element by multiples of its index. Therefore, the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices. 

3. **Feasibility Check**: To make the sequence sum to zero, the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, we can perform operations to adjust the sequence to zero; otherwise, it's impossible.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the sum of the sequence.
   - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.
   - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.
   - If it is, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case.N
        A = test_case.A
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if the sequence can be made "good" by verifying if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero; otherwise, it cannot.

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Function Call**: The function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that involve reading from standard input and output. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, the function needs to be called to process the input.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct. However, since the function is not called, no output is generated.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is called after its definition to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is correctly parsed and processed. The current logic for reading and processing input seems correct, but it needs to be executed.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly. The current logic appends results to a list and prints them, which is correct.

### Corrected Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0

INFO - [Task id] 583 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if we can make the sum of the sequence zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key is to check if the sum of the sequence can be adjusted to zero using these operations.

2. **Mistake in Logic**: The current solution checks if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. However, this is not sufficient. We need to ensure that the operations can adjust each element such that the entire sequence sums to zero.

3. **Correct Approach**: The sum of the sequence should be exactly equal to the sum of indices after performing the operations. This means that the total decrement we can achieve should match the initial sum of the sequence.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Calculate Required Decrement**: For each test case, calculate the total sum of the sequence and the sum of indices.

2. **Check Feasibility**: Determine if the total sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by checking if the sum of the sequence is exactly equal to the sum of indices.

3. **Output the Correct Result**: If the sum of the sequence equals the sum of indices, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

### Corrected Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        # Check if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero
        if sum_A == sum_indices:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the solution
is_good_sequence_possible()
```

### Explanation

- **Logic Correction**: The solution now checks if the sum of the sequence is exactly equal to the sum of indices, which is the correct condition for making the sequence sum to zero using the allowed operations.
- **Function Call**: The function is called to ensure execution.
- **Output**: The results are printed correctly based on the new logic.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.
You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the given sequence good or "NO" if it is impossible.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of integers, and we want to determine if it's possible to make the sum of the sequence equal to zero by performing a series of operations. In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence "good" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to adjust each element by multiples of its index. Therefore, the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices. 

3. **Feasibility Check**: To make the sequence sum to zero, the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, we can perform operations to adjust the sequence to zero; otherwise, it's impossible.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the sum of the sequence.
   - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.
   - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.
   - If it is, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case.N
        A = test_case.A
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if the sequence can be made "good" by verifying if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero; otherwise, it cannot.

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Function Call**: The function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that involve reading from standard input and output. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, the function needs to be called to process the input.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct. However, since the function is not called, no output is generated.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is called after its definition to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is correctly parsed and processed. The current logic for reading and processing input seems correct, but it needs to be executed.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly. The current logic appends results to a list and prints them, which is correct.

### Corrected Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if we can make the sum of the sequence zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key is to check if the sum of the sequence can be adjusted to zero using these operations.

2. **Mistake in Logic**: The current solution checks if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. However, this is not sufficient. We need to ensure that the operations can adjust each element such that the entire sequence sums to zero.

3. **Correct Approach**: The sum of the sequence should be exactly equal to the sum of indices after performing the operations. This means that the total decrement we can achieve should match the initial sum of the sequence.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Calculate Required Decrement**: For each test case, calculate the total sum of the sequence and the sum of indices.

2. **Check Feasibility**: Determine if the total sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by checking if the sum of the sequence is exactly equal to the sum of indices.

3. **Output the Correct Result**: If the sum of the sequence equals the sum of indices, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. The core concept here was understanding the function f(P) and how to manipulate permutations to achieve a specific sum.

    The key strategy was to start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum of maximums, and then adjust it to decrease the sum to the desired K. This involved swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum while ensuring the sum does not drop below K.

    One important realization was calculating the maximum and minimum possible values of f(P) for a given N. If K was outside this range, it was impossible to achieve, and the output should be -1. This check helped quickly eliminate impossible cases.

    The solution involved iterating over the permutation and making swaps to adjust the sum. This approach was efficient and worked well within the constraints, as evidenced by the successful test results. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation properties and how to manipulate them to achieve specific outcomes.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.
You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the given sequence good or "NO" if it is impossible.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10$
- $|A_i| \le 100$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (10 points): $N = 1$
Subtask #2 (30 points): $N \le 2$
Subtask #3 (60 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
1
-1
2
1 2

-----Example Output-----
NO
YES

-----Explanation-----
Example case 2: We can perform two operations â€• subtract $1$ from $A_1$ and $2$ from $A_2$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of integers, and we want to determine if it's possible to make the sum of the sequence equal to zero by performing a series of operations. In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence "good" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to adjust each element by multiples of its index. Therefore, the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices. 

3. **Feasibility Check**: To make the sequence sum to zero, the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, we can perform operations to adjust the sequence to zero; otherwise, it's impossible.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the sum of the sequence.
   - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.
   - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.
   - If it is, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case.N
        A = test_case.A
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if the sequence can be made "good" by verifying if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero; otherwise, it cannot.

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Function Call**: The function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that involve reading from standard input and output. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, the function needs to be called to process the input.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct. However, since the function is not called, no output is generated.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is called after its definition to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is correctly parsed and processed. The current logic for reading and processing input seems correct, but it needs to be executed.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly. The current logic appends results to a list and prints them, which is correct.

### Corrected Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            results.append("YES")
        else:

    for result in results:
        print(result)

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if we can make the sum of the sequence zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key is to check if the sum of the sequence can be adjusted to zero using these operations.

2. **Mistake in Logic**: The current solution checks if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. However, this is not sufficient. We need to ensure that the operations can adjust each element such that the entire sequence sums to zero.

3. **Correct Approach**: The sum of the sequence should be exactly equal to the sum of indices after performing the operations. This means that the total decrement we can achieve should match the initial sum of the sequence.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Calculate Required Decrement**: For each test case, calculate the total sum of the sequence and the sum of indices.

2. **Check Feasibility**: Determine if the total sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by checking if the sum of the sequence is exactly equal to the sum of indices.

3. **Output the Correct Result**: If the sum of the sequence equals the sum of indices, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

### Corrected Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        # Check if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero
        if sum_A == sum_indices:

### Explanation

- **Logic Correction**: The solution now checks if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices, which is necessary for the sequence to be adjusted to zero. Additionally, it checks if the required number of operations (`k`) can be applied to each element without making any element negative.
- **Feasibility Check**: For each element, it checks if subtracting `k * (i + 1)` results in a non-negative number, ensuring the operation is valid.
- **Output**: The results are printed based on whether the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.
You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the given sequence good or "NO" if it is impossible.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10$
- $|A_i| \le 100$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (10 points): $N = 1$
Subtask #2 (30 points): $N \le 2$
Subtask #3 (60 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
1
-1
2
1 2

-----Example Output-----
NO
YES

-----Explanation-----
Example case 2: We can perform two operations â€• subtract $1$ from $A_1$ and $2$ from $A_2$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of integers, and we want to determine if it's possible to make the sum of the sequence equal to zero by performing a series of operations. In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence "good" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to adjust each element by multiples of its index. Therefore, the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices. 

3. **Feasibility Check**: To make the sequence sum to zero, the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, we can perform operations to adjust the sequence to zero; otherwise, it's impossible.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the sum of the sequence.
   - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.
   - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.
   - If it is, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case.N
        A = test_case.A
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if the sequence can be made "good" by verifying if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero; otherwise, it cannot.

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Function Call**: The function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that involve reading from standard input and output. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, the function needs to be called to process the input.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct. However, since the function is not called, no output is generated.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is called after its definition to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is correctly parsed and processed. The current logic for reading and processing input seems correct, but it needs to be executed.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly. The current logic appends results to a list and prints them, which is correct.

### Corrected Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if we can make the sum of the sequence zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key is to check if the sum of the sequence can be adjusted to zero using these operations.

2. **Mistake in Logic**: The current solution checks if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. However, this is not sufficient. We need to ensure that the operations can adjust each element such that the entire sequence sums to zero.

3. **Correct Approach**: The sum of the sequence should be exactly equal to the sum of indices after performing the operations. This means that the total decrement we can achieve should match the initial sum of the sequence.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Calculate Required Decrement**: For each test case, calculate the total sum of the sequence and the sum of indices.

2. **Check Feasibility**: Determine if the total sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by checking if the sum of the sequence is exactly equal to the sum of indices.

3. **Output the Correct Result**: If the sum of the sequence equals the sum of indices, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. The core concept here was understanding the function f(P) and how to manipulate permutations to achieve a specific sum.

    The key strategy was to start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum of maximums, and then adjust it to decrease the sum to the desired K. This involved swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum while ensuring the sum does not drop below K.

    One important realization was calculating the maximum and minimum possible values of f(P) for a given N. If K was outside this range, it was impossible to achieve, and the output should be -1. This check helped quickly eliminate impossible cases.

    The solution involved iterating over the permutation and making swaps to adjust the sum. This approach was efficient and worked well within the constraints, as evidenced by the successful test results. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation properties and how to manipulate them to achieve specific outcomes.

- **Feasibility Check**: For each element, it checks if subtracting `k * (i + 1)` results in a non-negative number, ensuring the operation is valid.
- **Output**: The results are printed based on whether the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

### Explanation

- **Logic Correction**: The solution now checks if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices, which is necessary for the sequence to be adjusted to zero. Additionally, it checks if the required number of operations (`k`) can be applied to each element without making any element negative.
- **Feasibility Check**: For each element, it checks if subtracting `k * (i + 1)` results in a non-negative number, ensuring the operation is valid.
- **Output**: The results are printed based on whether the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of integers, and we want to determine if it's possible to make the sum of the sequence equal to zero by performing a series of operations. In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence "good" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to adjust each element by multiples of its index. Therefore, the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices. 

3. **Feasibility Check**: To make the sequence sum to zero, the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, we can perform operations to adjust the sequence to zero; otherwise, it's impossible.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the sum of the sequence.
   - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.
   - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.
   - If it is, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case.N
        A = test_case.A
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if the sequence can be made "good" by verifying if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero; otherwise, it cannot.

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Function Call**: The function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that involve reading from standard input and output. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, the function needs to be called to process the input.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct. However, since the function is not called, no output is generated.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is called after its definition to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is correctly parsed and processed. The current logic for reading and processing input seems correct, but it needs to be executed.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly. The current logic appends results to a list and prints them, which is correct.

### Corrected Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if we can make the sum of the sequence zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key is to check if the sum of the sequence can be adjusted to zero using these operations.

2. **Mistake in Logic**: The current solution checks if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. However, this is not sufficient. We need to ensure that the operations can adjust each element such that the entire sequence sums to zero.

3. **Correct Approach**: The sum of the sequence should be exactly equal to the sum of indices after performing the operations. This means that the total decrement we can achieve should match the initial sum of the sequence.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Calculate Required Decrement**: For each test case, calculate the total sum of the sequence and the sum of indices.

2. **Check Feasibility**: Determine if the total sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by checking if the sum of the sequence is exactly equal to the sum of indices.

3. **Output the Correct Result**: If the sum of the sequence equals the sum of indices, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

3. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach is to simulate the operations and ensure that the sequence can be adjusted to zero by iteratively applying the operations and checking if the sequence can be made non-negative at each step.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Simulate Operations**: For each test case, simulate the operations by iteratively adjusting each element and checking if the sequence can be made non-negative.

2. **Cumulative Check**: Ensure that the cumulative effect of operations allows the sequence to be adjusted to zero.

3. **Output the Correct Result**: If the sequence can be adjusted to zero, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

### Corrected Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        # Check if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero
        if sum_A == sum_indices:

INFO - [Task id] 583 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be made to sum to zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.

#### Core Concepts and Patterns

1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.

2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.

#### Strategies and Errors

- **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.

- **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.

- **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.

#### Final Solution

The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            k = sum_A // sum_indices
            possible = True
            for i in range(N):
                if A[i] < k * (i + 1):
                    possible = False
                    break
            if possible:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

is_good_sequence_possible()
```

This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.
You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of integers, and we want to determine if it's possible to make the sum of the sequence equal to zero by performing a series of operations. In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence "good" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to adjust each element by multiples of its index. Therefore, the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices. 

3. **Feasibility Check**: To make the sequence sum to zero, the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, we can perform operations to adjust the sequence to zero; otherwise, it's impossible.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the sum of the sequence.
   - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.
   - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.
   - If it is, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case.N
        A = test_case.A
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if the sequence can be made "good" by verifying if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero; otherwise, it cannot.

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Function Call**: The function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that involve reading from standard input and output. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, the function needs to be called to process the input.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct. However, since the function is not called, no output is generated.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the function `is_good_sequence_possible()` is called after its definition to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is correctly parsed and processed. The current logic for reading and processing input seems correct, but it needs to be executed.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly. The current logic appends results to a list and prints them, which is correct.

### Corrected Solution

def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0

3. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach is to simulate the operations and ensure that the sequence can be adjusted to zero by iteratively applying the operations and checking if the sequence can be made non-negative at each step.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Simulate Operations**: For each test case, simulate the operations by iteratively adjusting each element and checking if the sequence can be made non-negative.

2. **Cumulative Check**: Ensure that the cumulative effect of operations allows the sequence to be adjusted to zero.

3. **Output the Correct Result**: If the sequence can be adjusted to zero, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

### Corrected Solution

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        # Check if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero
        if sum_A == sum_indices:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the solution
is_good_sequence_possible()
```

### Explanation

- **Logic Correction**: The solution now checks if the sum of the sequence is exactly equal to the sum of indices, which is the correct condition for making the sequence sum to zero using the allowed operations.
- **Function Call**: The function is called to ensure execution.
- **Output**: The results are printed correctly based on the new logic.

INFO - [Task id] 583 [prompt] Let's correct the solution by ensuring the logic correctly checks if the sequence can be made to sum to zero using the allowed operations. Here's the revised Python code:

```python
def is_good_sequence_possible():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        sum_A = sum(A)
        sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
        # Check if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero
        if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
            k = sum_A // sum_indices
            possible = True
            for i in range(N):
                if A[i] < k * (i + 1):
                    possible = False
                    break
            if possible:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the solution

```

### Explanation

- **Logic Correction**: The solution now checks if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices, which is necessary for the sequence to be adjusted to zero. Additionally, it checks if the required number of operations (`k`) can be applied to each element without making any element negative.
- **Feasibility Check**: For each element, it checks if subtracting `k * (i + 1)` results in a non-negative number, ensuring the operation is valid.
- **Output**: The results are printed based on whether the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

The problem required determining if a sequence of integers could be made to sum to zero using specific operations. My initial approach focused on checking if the sum of the sequence was a multiple of the sum of indices, which was incorrect. The key insight from the official solution is that the problem can be simplified by considering the sum of positive and negative elements separately.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Handling Single Element**: If the sequence has only one element, it can only be made zero if it is non-negative. This is a straightforward check.

2. **Sum of Positives vs. Negatives**: For sequences with more than one element, the solution checks if the sum of positive numbers is greater than or equal to the absolute sum of negative numbers. This ensures that the positive elements can be reduced enough to offset the negative elements, making the total sum zero.

3. **Simplified Logic**: The official solution avoids complex calculations involving indices and instead focuses on the net effect of operations, which is more intuitive and efficient.

#### Why My Approach Failed:

- **Complexity**: My approach involved unnecessary complexity by trying to calculate the exact number of operations needed, which was not required.
- **Incorrect Assumptions**: I assumed that the sum of the sequence needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices, which was a misinterpretation of the problem.

The official solution is more effective as it directly addresses the core requirement of balancing positive and negative contributions to achieve a zero sum, without overcomplicating the logic. This experience highlights the importance of simplifying the problem and focusing on the net effect of operations rather than getting bogged down in unnecessary details.
