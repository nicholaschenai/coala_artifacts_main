    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to find the number of ways to express a given number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \\( K \\). The core concept here was to use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers, ensuring that each combination uses unique integers.\n\nThe strategy that worked involved using a helper function to recursively try different integers starting from 1 up to \\( N \\), calculating their \\( K \\)-th powers, and checking if they can sum up to \\( N \\). Memoization was crucial in optimizing the solution by storing results of subproblems, which prevented redundant calculations and significantly improved efficiency.\n\nThe recursive function `helper` was designed to handle base cases where the remaining sum is zero (indicating a valid combination) or negative (indicating an invalid path). The use of a memoization dictionary allowed us to store and retrieve results for specific states, reducing the computational overhead.\n\nOverall, this problem reinforced the importance of recursive backtracking combined with memoization for solving combinatorial problems efficiently. The solution was successful in passing all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, I found that both my solution and the official solution effectively address the problem, but they employ different strategies.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Recursive Backtracking with Memoization**:\n   - My approach used a recursive backtracking method with memoization to explore all possible combinations of integers whose \\( K \\)-th powers sum up to \\( N \\). This method is intuitive and leverages recursion to handle the exploration of combinations, while memoization optimizes repeated calculations.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach, which is often more efficient for problems involving counting combinations or subsets. It constructs a `reach` array where each index represents whether a sum can be reached using the powers of integers. This approach iteratively builds up solutions for smaller subproblems, which is a hallmark of dynamic programming.\n\n3. **Efficiency**:\n   - The dynamic programming solution is generally more efficient in terms of time complexity because it avoids the overhead of recursive calls and directly builds up the solution using iterative loops. This can be particularly advantageous for larger inputs.\n\n4. **Space Complexity**:\n   - Both solutions have similar space complexity, as they both store intermediate results (either in a memoization dictionary or a DP array).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe official solution is insightful in demonstrating how dynamic programming can be applied to a problem that initially seems suited for recursion. It highlights the power of iterative solutions in reducing the overhead associated with recursion and provides a clear, efficient way to solve the problem. In future problems involving combinations or subset sums, considering a dynamic programming approach can be beneficial for optimizing performance.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers, N and K. It then calculates the number of ways to express N as a sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of K using a helper function. The results for each test case are stored in a list and then printed out one by one.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the number of ways a number can be expressed as a sum of unique integers raised to a certain power. This is particularly relevant in combinatorial mathematics and number theory, where such problems often arise. It can be applied in algorithm design for solving partition problems, especially those involving constraints on the uniqueness of elements and their powers. This approach can also be adapted for problems in computer science that involve dynamic programming and memoization techniques to efficiently solve recursive problems with overlapping subproblems."
