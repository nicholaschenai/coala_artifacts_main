Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: \n           - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.\n           - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.\n\n        2. **Constraints**:\n           - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.\n           - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.\n\n        3. **Combinatorial Approach**:\n           - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:\n             - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.\n             - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.\n           - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.\n           - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.\n\n        4. **Modulo Operation**:\n           - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10^9 + 7\n            precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N\n\n            results = []\n            for each query (I, K):\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD\n                    count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        function precompute_factorials(N):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i from 2 to N:\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i from N-1 down to 1:\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        function C(n, k):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n            # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n            factorials, inverse_factorials = precompute_factorials(N, MOD)\n    \n            results = []\n            for I, K in queries:\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD)\n                    count_greater = pow(2, N-I, MOD)\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        def precompute_factorials(N, MOD):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i in range(2, N+1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i in range(N-1, 0, -1):\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        def C(n, k, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                queries = []\n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n                    queries.append((I, K))\n        \n                results.extend(calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries))\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently calculates the number of subsets for each query by precomputing factorials and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '3 3', '1 2', '2 1', '3 2'] Output: 0\n        2\n        2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The problem of finding subsets where a specific number `I` appears at position `K` in a sorted subset is a combinatorial challenge. The official solution provides a straightforward approach using factorials and combinatorial mathematics, which is similar to the approach I took, but with some differences in implementation.\n\n    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n    1. **Factorial Calculation**:\n       - The official solution uses Python's `math.factorial` to compute factorials directly. This is a simple and effective way to handle factorials, especially when the constraints are manageable.\n\n    2. **Combinatorial Logic**:\n       - The solution calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from the `I-1` elements less than `I` using a loop to compute the binomial coefficient. This is done by iteratively multiplying and dividing to avoid large intermediate values, which is a practical approach to handle large numbers without overflow.\n\n    3. **Power of Two**:\n       - The number of ways to choose any subset of numbers greater than `I` is calculated as `2^(N-I)`, which is consistent with my approach. This is efficiently computed using exponentiation.\n\n    4. **Modulo Operation**:\n       - The result is taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to ensure it fits within standard integer limits, which is crucial for large computations.\n\n    ### Reflection:\n\n    - The official solution is insightful in its use of direct factorial computation and iterative calculation of binomial coefficients, which avoids the need for precomputing factorials and inverse factorials. This can be more efficient in terms of space when the number of queries is large but the range of `N` is not too extensive.\n    - My approach precomputed factorials and inverse factorials to quickly compute binomial coefficients, which is beneficial when `N` is large and many queries are involved. However, the official solution's method of calculating binomial coefficients on-the-fly is a good alternative when memory usage is a concern.\n    - Both solutions effectively handle the constraints and provide correct results, but the official solution's simplicity in handling factorials and binomial coefficients is a valuable technique to remember for similar problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The core concept here was to use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers, ensuring that each combination uses unique integers.\n\nThe strategy that worked involved using a helper function to recursively try different integers starting from 1 up to \\( N \\), calculating their \\( K \\)-th powers, and checking if they can sum up to \\( N \\). Memoization was crucial in optimizing the solution by storing results of subproblems, which prevented redundant calculations and significantly improved efficiency.\n\nThe recursive function `helper` was designed to handle base cases where the remaining sum is zero (indicating a valid combination) or negative (indicating an invalid path). The use of a memoization dictionary allowed us to store and retrieve results for specific states, reducing the computational overhead.\n\nOverall, this problem reinforced the importance of recursive backtracking combined with memoization for solving combinatorial problems efficiently. The solution was successful in passing all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, I found that both my solution and the official solution effectively address the problem, but they employ different strategies.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Recursive Backtracking with Memoization**:\n   - My approach used a recursive backtracking method with memoization to explore all possible combinations of integers whose \\( K \\)-th powers sum up to \\( N \\). This method is intuitive and leverages recursion to handle the exploration of combinations, while memoization optimizes repeated calculations.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach, which is often more efficient for problems involving counting combinations or subsets. It constructs a `reach` array where each index represents whether a sum can be reached using the powers of integers. This approach iteratively builds up solutions for smaller subproblems, which is a hallmark of dynamic programming.\n\n3. **Efficiency**:\n   - The dynamic programming solution is generally more efficient in terms of time complexity because it avoids the overhead of recursive calls and directly builds up the solution using iterative loops. This can be particularly advantageous for larger inputs.\n\n4. **Space Complexity**:\n   - Both solutions have similar space complexity, as they both store intermediate results (either in a memoization dictionary or a DP array).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe official solution is insightful in demonstrating how dynamic programming can be applied to a problem that initially seems suited for recursion. It highlights the power of iterative solutions in reducing the overhead associated with recursion and provides a clear, efficient way to solve the problem. In future problems involving combinations or subset sums, considering a dynamic programming approach can be beneficial for optimizing performance."

It then calculates the number of ways to express N as a sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of K using a helper function. The results for each test case are stored in a list and then printed out one by one.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the number of ways a number can be expressed as a sum of unique integers raised to a certain power. This is particularly relevant in combinatorial mathematics and number theory, where such problems often arise. It can be applied in algorithm design for solving partition problems, especially those involving constraints on the uniqueness of elements and their powers. This approach can also be adapted for problems in computer science that involve dynamic programming and memoization techniques to efficiently solve recursive problems with overlapping subproblems."
