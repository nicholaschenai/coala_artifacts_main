[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?

- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq K \leq 6$

-----Sample Input:-----

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of the \( K \)-th powers of unique positive integers. We are given multiple test cases, each with its own \( N \) and \( K \).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find combinations of unique positive integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

2. **Approach**:
   - Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers.
   - For each integer starting from 1, calculate its \( K \)-th power and check if it can be part of the sum.
   - If adding this power to the current sum does not exceed \( N \), recursively attempt to find the rest of the sum using the next integers.
   - Ensure that each combination uses unique integers by always considering integers greater than the last used integer.
   - Count each valid combination that sums exactly to \( N \).

3. **Constraints Handling**:
   - The maximum value for \( N \) is 1000, and \( K \) can be up to 6, so the powers can be large, but the number of integers to consider is limited by the fact that their powers should not exceed \( N \).

### Pseudocode

```
function countWays(N, K):
    define recursive function findWays(current_sum, start):
        if current_sum == N:
            increment the count of valid ways
            return
        for each integer i starting from 'start':
            calculate power = i^K
            if current_sum + power > N:
                break the loop
            recursively call findWays(current_sum + power, i + 1)

    initialize count to 0
    call findWays(0, 1)
    return count

read T
for each test case:
    read N, K
    print countWays(N, K)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def countWays(N, K):
    def findWays(current_sum, start):
        nonlocal count
        if current_sum == N:
            count += 1
            return
        for i in range(start, N + 1):
            power = i ** K
            if current_sum + power > N:
                break
            findWays(current_sum + power, i + 1)

    count = 0
    findWays(0, 1)
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(countWays(N, K))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum to \( N \). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed sequentially.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: 
           - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.
           - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.

        2. **Constraints**:
           - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.
           - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.

        3. **Combinatorial Approach**:
           - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:
             - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.
             - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.
           - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.
           - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.

        4. **Modulo Operation**:
           - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):
            MOD = 10^9 + 7
            precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N

            results = []
            for each query (I, K):
                if K > I or K > N:
                    results.append(0)
                else:
                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD
                    count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD
                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD
                    results.append(result)
            return results

        function precompute_factorials(N):
            factorials = [1] * (N+1)
            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)
            for i from 2 to N:
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD
            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)
            for i from N-1 down to 1:
                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD
            return factorials, inverse_factorials

        function C(n, k):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

[Reflection]:
    The problem of finding subsets where a specific number `I` appears at position `K` in a sorted subset is a combinatorial challenge. The official solution provides a straightforward approach using factorials and combinatorial mathematics, which is similar to the approach I took, but with some differences in implementation.

    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

    1. **Factorial Calculation**:
       - The official solution uses Python's `math.factorial` to compute factorials directly. This is a simple and effective way to handle factorials, especially when the constraints are manageable.

    2. **Combinatorial Logic**:
       - The solution calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from the `I-1` elements less than `I` using a loop to compute the binomial coefficient. This is done by iteratively multiplying and dividing to avoid large intermediate values, which is a practical approach to handle large numbers without overflow.

    3. **Power of Two**:
       - The number of ways to choose any subset of numbers greater than `I` is calculated as `2^(N-I)`, which is consistent with my approach. This is efficiently computed using exponentiation.

    4. **Modulo Operation**:
       - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within standard integer limits, which is crucial for large computations.

    ### Reflection:

    - The official solution is insightful in its use of direct factorial computation and iterative calculation of binomial coefficients, which avoids the need for precomputing factorials and inverse factorials. This can be more efficient in terms of space when the number of queries is large but the range of `N` is not too extensive.
    - My approach precomputed factorials and inverse factorials to quickly compute binomial coefficients, which is beneficial when `N` is large and many queries are involved. However, the official solution's method of calculating binomial coefficients on-the-fly is a good alternative when memory usage is a concern.
    - Both solutions effectively handle the constraints and provide correct results, but the official solution's simplicity in handling factorials and binomial coefficients is a valuable technique to remember for similar problems.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). For each test case, we are given \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to find the number of unique combinations of integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find combinations of unique integers such that their \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).
   - For example, if \( N = 4 \) and \( K = 1 \), the valid combinations are [4] and [1, 3].

2. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Use a recursive function to explore all possible combinations of integers.
   - Start with the smallest integer and try to build up to \( N \) using the \( K \)-th powers of integers.
   - Ensure that each combination uses unique integers.

3. **Backtracking**:
   - Use backtracking to explore different combinations.
   - If a combination exceeds \( N \), backtrack and try a different path.
   - If a combination exactly equals \( N \), count it as a valid way.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

## Pseudocode

```
function countWays(N, K):
    memo = {}
    
    function helper(remaining, start):
        if remaining == 0:
            return 1
        if remaining < 0:
            return 0
        if (remaining, start) in memo:
            return memo[(remaining, start)]
        
        count = 0
        for i from start to N:
            power = i^K
            if power > remaining:
                break
            count += helper(remaining - power, i + 1)
        
        memo[(remaining, start)] = count

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq K \leq 6$

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4 1
38 2

-----Sample Output:-----
2
1

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find the number of ways to express a given number \( N \) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \( K \). The core concept here was to use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers, ensuring that each combination uses unique integers.

The strategy that worked involved using a helper function to recursively try different integers starting from 1 up to \( N \), calculating their \( K \)-th powers, and checking if they can sum up to \( N \). Memoization was crucial in optimizing the solution by storing results of subproblems, which prevented redundant calculations and significantly improved efficiency.

The recursive function `helper` was designed to handle base cases where the remaining sum is zero (indicating a valid combination) or negative (indicating an invalid path). The use of a memoization dictionary allowed us to store and retrieve results for specific states, reducing the computational overhead.

Overall, this problem reinforced the importance of recursive backtracking combined with memoization for solving combinatorial problems efficiently. The solution was successful in passing all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.

Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq K \leq 6$

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4 1
38 2

-----Sample Output:-----
2
1

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). For each test case, we are given \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to find the number of unique combinations of integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find combinations of unique integers such that their \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).
   - For example, if \( N = 4 \) and \( K = 1 \), the valid combinations are [4] and [1, 3].

2. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Use a recursive function to explore all possible combinations of integers.
   - Start with the smallest integer and try to build up to \( N \) using the \( K \)-th powers of integers.
   - Ensure that each combination uses unique integers.

3. **Backtracking**:
   - Use backtracking to explore different combinations.
   - If a combination exceeds \( N \), backtrack and try a different path.
   - If a combination exactly equals \( N \), count it as a valid way.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

## Pseudocode

```
function countWays(N, K):
    memo = {}
    
    function helper(remaining, start):
        if remaining == 0:
            return 1
        if remaining < 0:
            return 0
        if (remaining, start) in memo:
            return memo[(remaining, start)]
        
        count = 0
        for i from start to N:
            power = i^K
            if power > remaining:
                break
            count += helper(remaining - power, i + 1)
        
        memo[(remaining, start)] = count
        return count
    
    return helper(N, 1)

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, K
        print countWays(N, K)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def countWays(N, K):
    # Memoization dictionary to store results of subproblems
    memo = {}
    
    def helper(remaining, start):
        # Base case: if remaining is 0, we found a valid combination
        if remaining == 0:
            return 1
        # If remaining is negative, this path is invalid
        if remaining < 0:
            return 0
        # Check if the result is already computed
        if (remaining, start) in memo:
            return memo[(remaining, start)]
        
        count = 0
        # Try each number starting from 'start'
        for i in range(start, N + 1):
            power = i ** K
            # If the power exceeds the remaining sum, break early
            if power > remaining:
                break
            # Recurse with the reduced sum and next starting number
            count += helper(remaining - power, i + 1)
        
        # Store the result in memoization dictionary
        memo[(remaining, start)] = count
        return count
    
    # Start the helper function with the full sum N and starting number 1
    return helper(N, 1)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(countWays(N, K))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution uses a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the number of ways to express \( N \) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \( K \). The `helper` function explores all possible combinations using backtracking, and memoization ensures that we do not recompute results for the same subproblems.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x,n = map(int,input().split())
    reach = [0]*(x+1)
    reach[0] = 1
    i=1
    while i**n<=x:
        j = 1
        while j+i**n<=x:
            j+=1
        j-=1
        while j>=0:
            if reach[j]>0:
                reach[j+i**n]+=reach[j]
            j-=1
        i+=1
    #print(reach)
    print(reach[-1])

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, I found that both my solution and the official solution effectively address the problem, but they employ different strategies.

### Key Insights:

1. **Recursive Backtracking with Memoization**:
   - My approach used a recursive backtracking method with memoization to explore all possible combinations of integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \). This method is intuitive and leverages recursion to handle the exploration of combinations, while memoization optimizes repeated calculations.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach, which is often more efficient for problems involving counting combinations or subsets. It constructs a `reach` array where each index represents whether a sum can be reached using the powers of integers. This approach iteratively builds up solutions for smaller subproblems, which is a hallmark of dynamic programming.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The dynamic programming solution is generally more efficient in terms of time complexity because it avoids the overhead of recursive calls and directly builds up the solution using iterative loops. This can be particularly advantageous for larger inputs.

4. **Space Complexity**:
   - Both solutions have similar space complexity, as they both store intermediate results (either in a memoization dictionary or a DP array).

### Conclusion:

The official solution is insightful in demonstrating how dynamic programming can be applied to a problem that initially seems suited for recursion. It highlights the power of iterative solutions in reducing the overhead associated with recursion and provides a clear, efficient way to solve the problem. In future problems involving combinations or subset sums, considering a dynamic programming approach can be beneficial for optimizing performance.
