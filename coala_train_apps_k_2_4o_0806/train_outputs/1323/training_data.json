    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem revolves around finding a contiguous subarray with a sum closest to zero. This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using prefix sums and sorting. The key idea is to leverage the prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray and then find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray with the sum closest to zero.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\nInitially, the approach involved calculating prefix sums and using a dictionary to track their indices. The idea was to find the smallest absolute difference between any two prefix sums. However, the solution failed to correctly output the actual subarray sum (which can be negative) and instead outputted its absolute value. This was a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.\n\nThe correct strategy involved sorting the prefix sums along with their indices and iterating over them to find the smallest difference. The challenge was ensuring that the actual subarray sum was outputted, not its absolute value.\n\n#### Fixing Errors\nThe main error was in the output of the subarray sum. The solution was adjusted to track the actual subarray sum and ensure it was printed correctly. Sorting the prefix sums allowed for an efficient comparison of consecutive sums to find the minimum difference.\n\n#### Final Solution\nThe final solution involves:\n1. Calculating prefix sums.\n2. Sorting the prefix sums with their indices.\n3. Iterating over sorted prefix sums to find the smallest difference.\n4. Outputting the actual subarray sum and the correct segment indices.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct, handling large inputs within the constraints.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Prefix Sum and Sorting**: The problem involves finding a subarray with a sum closest to zero. The use of prefix sums is crucial because it allows us to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. Sorting these prefix sums helps in finding the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray with the sum closest to zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search with Bisect**: The official solution uses the `bisect` module to maintain a sorted list of prefix sums. This is a clever use of binary search to efficiently insert and find positions in the list, which helps in maintaining the order and quickly finding the closest sums.\n\n3. **Handling Indices and Lengths**: The solution carefully tracks indices and lengths of subarrays to ensure that the longest subarray is chosen when multiple subarrays have the same sum closest to zero. This involves checking conditions and updating indices accordingly.\n\n4. **Non-trivial Edge Cases**: The solution accounts for edge cases where the prefix sum differences are the same, ensuring that the longest subarray is selected. This requires careful handling of indices and conditions.\n\n### Why the Official Solution Works\n\n- **Efficiency**: The official solution efficiently handles large inputs by using prefix sums and binary search, which reduces the complexity compared to a naive approach that might involve checking all possible subarrays.\n  \n- **Correctness**: By maintaining a sorted list of prefix sums and using binary search, the solution ensures that the closest sums are found quickly and accurately. The careful handling of indices ensures that the correct subarray is selected.\n\n### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Use of Data Structures**: The use of a sorted list with binary search (via `bisect`) is a powerful technique for maintaining order and efficiently finding elements. This is particularly useful in problems involving range queries or closest value searches.\n\n- **Attention to Detail**: Handling indices and ensuring the correct subarray is selected requires careful attention to detail, especially when dealing with conditions that involve both the sum and the length of subarrays.\n\n- **Iterative Improvement**: The process of iteratively refining the solution based on test feedback highlights the importance of testing and debugging in problem-solving. Each iteration provides insights that help in converging towards the correct solution. \n\nOverall, the official solution provides a robust and efficient approach to solving the problem, leveraging advanced techniques like binary search and careful index management.",
