This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.\nThe railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.\nThe Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.\nThe minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!\nIn other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.\nFor example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:\n$ $\nStation              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 \nExpected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 \n\n$ $\nIf the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$.\n- $-10^9 \\leq p_i \\leq 10^9$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \\leq N \\leq 4000$\n- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n8\n-20\n90\n-30\n-20\n80\n-70\n-60\n125\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n-5\n6 8\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of their profit/loss values is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of all profits/losses from the start up to station `i`. This allows us to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.\n\n2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we need to find two prefix sums that are closest to each other. The difference between these two prefix sums will give us the sum of the subarray between them.\n\n3. **Sorting for Efficiency**: By sorting the prefix sums, we can efficiently find the two closest sums. The difference between these two sums will be minimized, and we can determine the indices of the subarray by their original positions.\n\n4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, we choose the longest one. This can be naturally handled by checking the length of the subarray when we find two prefix sums with the same difference.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a prefix sum array with the first element as zero.\n2. Iterate through the profits/losses and fill the prefix sum array.\n3. Pair each prefix sum with its index and sort these pairs.\n4. Initialize variables to track the minimum difference and the best indices.\n5. Iterate through the sorted prefix sums:\n   - Calculate the difference between consecutive prefix sums.\n   - If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum and the indices.\n   - If the difference is the same but the subarray is longer, update the indices.\n6. Output the minimum difference and the indices of the best subarray.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_best_segment(N, profits):\n    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums\n    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]\n    \n    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort\n    indexed_prefix_sums = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]\n    indexed_prefix_sums.sort()\n    \n    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the best segment\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_start = 0\n    best_end = 0\n    \n    # Step 4: Find the closest pair of prefix sums\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        current_diff = abs(indexed_prefix_sums[i][0] - indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][0])\n        start_index = min(indexed_prefix_sums[i][1], indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][1])\n        end_index = max(indexed_prefix_sums[i][1], indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][1]) - 1\n        \n        # Check if we found a better segment\n        if current_diff < min_diff or (current_diff == min_diff and (end_index - start_index) > (best_end - best_start)):\n            min_diff = current_diff\n            best_start = start_index\n            best_end = end_index\n    \n    # Step 5: Output the result\n    print(min_diff)\n    print(best_start + 1, best_end + 1)\n\n# Example usage:\n# N = 8\n# profits = [-20, 90, -30, -20, 80, -70, -60, 125]\n# find_best_segment(N, profits)\n```\n\nThis code efficiently finds the segment with the sum closest to zero by leveraging prefix sums and sorting, ensuring it runs in O(N log N) time, which is suitable for the given constraints."

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.\n\n    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes\n    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves:\n    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.\n    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.\n    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):\n        max_sum = 0\n        current_sum = 0\n        n = len(strengths)\n    \n        i = 0\n        while i < n:\n            # Start a new subsequence with the current element\n            current_sum = strengths[i]\n            i += 1\n        \n            # Alternate between adding and subtracting\n            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:\n                current_sum += strengths[i]\n                i += 1\n        \n            # Update the maximum sum found\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n    \n        return max_sum\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0\n            index += 2\n        \n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n        \n            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was efficiently computing the sum of elements in a subarray for multiple queries. The key strategy was to use a prefix sum array, which allows for constant-time computation of subarray sums. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it reduces the time complexity of each query from linear to constant time.\n\n    The solution involved:\n    1. Constructing a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.\n    2. For each query, using the prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of elements between two indices by subtracting the prefix sum at the start index from the prefix sum at the end index.\n\n    This method proved efficient and effective, handling the constraints well. The problem reinforced the utility of prefix sums in scenarios involving repeated range sum queries. The implementation was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. The solution was verified to work correctly with the provided test cases.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.\n\n2. **Tracking Prefix Sums**: The solution uses a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum. This is correct because it helps in identifying subarrays with a sum of zero.\n\n3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:\n   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between current and previous prefix sums.\n   - However, the logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the current prefix sum has been seen before, which is not sufficient to find the closest sum to zero.\n\n### Mistakes in the Solution\n\n1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Sum**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the prefix sum itself should be minimized. Instead, we should be looking for the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which represents the sum of a subarray.\n\n2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The solution does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum difference is zero, which is the ideal case.\n\n3. **Initialization of `min_abs_sum`**: The initial value of `min_abs_sum` is set to infinity, which is correct, but the logic to update it is not properly implemented.\n\n### Correct Approach\n\n1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.\n\n2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.\n\n3. **Find Minimum Difference**:\n   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.\n   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum_segment(N, profits):\n    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum\n    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)\n    prefix_index = {}\n    min_abs_sum = float('inf')\n    best_start = 0\n    best_end = 0\n\n    # Calculate prefix sums\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]\n\n    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero\n    for i in range(N + 1):\n        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]\n\n        # Check all previous prefix sums to find the closest to zero\n        for j in range(i):\n            subarray_sum = current_sum - prefix_sum[j]\n            if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and (i - j) > (best_end - best_start)):\n                min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)\n                best_start = j\n                best_end = i - 1\n\n    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment\n    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nN = int(data[0])\nprofits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))\n\n# Find the minimum segment\nmin_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(min_sum)\nprint(start, end)\n```\n\nThis revised solution correctly calculates the minimum absolute sum of any subarray and outputs the correct segment indices."

This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):\n        max_sum = 0\n        current_sum = 0\n        n = len(strengths)\n    \n        i = 0\n        while i < n:\n            # Start a new subsequence with the current element\n            current_sum = strengths[i]\n            i += 1\n        \n            # Alternate between adding and subtracting\n            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:\n                current_sum += strengths[i]\n                i += 1\n        \n            # Update the maximum sum found\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n    \n        return max_sum\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0\n            index += 2\n        \n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n        \n            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was efficiently computing the sum of elements in a subarray for multiple queries. The key strategy was to use a prefix sum array, which allows for constant-time computation of subarray sums. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it reduces the time complexity of each query from linear to constant time.\n\n    The solution involved:\n    1. Constructing a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.\n    2. For each query, using the prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of elements between two indices by subtracting the prefix sum at the start index from the prefix sum at the end index.\n\n    This method proved efficient and effective, handling the constraints well. The problem reinforced the utility of prefix sums in scenarios involving repeated range sum queries. The implementation was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. The solution was verified to work correctly with the provided test cases.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using prefix sums and sorting. The key idea is to leverage the prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray and then find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray with the sum closest to zero.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\nInitially, the approach involved calculating prefix sums and using a dictionary to track their indices. The idea was to find the smallest absolute difference between any two prefix sums. However, the solution failed to correctly output the actual subarray sum (which can be negative) and instead outputted its absolute value. This was a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.\n\nThe correct strategy involved sorting the prefix sums along with their indices and iterating over them to find the smallest difference. The challenge was ensuring that the actual subarray sum was outputted, not its absolute value.\n\n#### Fixing Errors\nThe main error was in the output of the subarray sum. The solution was adjusted to track the actual subarray sum and ensure it was printed correctly. Sorting the prefix sums allowed for an efficient comparison of consecutive sums to find the minimum difference.\n\n#### Final Solution\nThe final solution involves:\n1. Calculating prefix sums.\n2.

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Prefix Sum and Sorting**: The problem involves finding a subarray with a sum closest to zero. The use of prefix sums is crucial because it allows us to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. Sorting these prefix sums helps in finding the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray with the sum closest to zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search with Bisect**: The official solution uses the `bisect` module to maintain a sorted list of prefix sums. This is a clever use of binary search to efficiently insert and find positions in the list, which helps in maintaining the order and quickly finding the closest sums.\n\n3. **Handling Indices and Lengths**: The solution carefully tracks indices and lengths of subarrays to ensure that the longest subarray is chosen when multiple subarrays have the same sum closest to zero. This involves checking conditions and updating indices accordingly.\n\n4. **Non-trivial Edge Cases**: The solution accounts for edge cases where the prefix sum differences are the same, ensuring that the longest subarray is selected. This requires careful handling of indices and conditions.\n\n### Why the Official Solution Works\n\n- **Efficiency**: The official solution efficiently handles large inputs by using prefix sums and binary search, which reduces the complexity compared to a naive approach that might involve checking all possible subarrays.\n  \n- **Correctness**: By maintaining a sorted list of prefix sums and using binary search, the solution ensures that the closest sums are found quickly and accurately. The careful handling of indices ensures that the correct subarray is selected.\n\n### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Use of Data Structures**: The use of a sorted list with binary search (via `bisect`) is a powerful technique for maintaining order and efficiently finding elements. This is particularly useful in problems involving range queries or closest value searches.\n\n- **Attention to Detail**: Handling indices and ensuring the correct subarray is selected requires careful attention to detail, especially when dealing with conditions that involve both the sum and the length of subarrays.\n\n- **Iterative Improvement**: The process of iteratively refining the solution based on test feedback highlights the importance of testing and debugging in problem-solving. Each iteration provides insights that help in converging towards the correct solution. \n\nOverall, the official solution provides a robust and efficient approach to solving the problem, leveraging advanced techniques like binary search and careful index management."
