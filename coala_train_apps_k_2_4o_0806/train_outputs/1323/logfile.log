## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of their profit/loss values is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of all profits/losses from the start up to station `i`. This allows us to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.

2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we need to find two prefix sums that are closest to each other. The difference between these two prefix sums will give us the sum of the subarray between them.

3. **Sorting for Efficiency**: By sorting the prefix sums, we can efficiently find the two closest sums. The difference between these two sums will be minimized, and we can determine the indices of the subarray by their original positions.

4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, we choose the longest one. This can be naturally handled by checking the length of the subarray when we find two prefix sums with the same difference.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a prefix sum array with the first element as zero.
2. Iterate through the profits/losses and fill the prefix sum array.
3. Pair each prefix sum with its index and sort these pairs.
4. Initialize variables to track the minimum difference and the best indices.
5. Iterate through the sorted prefix sums:
   - Calculate the difference between consecutive prefix sums.
   - If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum and the indices.
   - If the difference is the same but the subarray is longer, update the indices.
6. Output the minimum difference and the indices of the best subarray.

### Python Code

```python
def find_best_segment(N, profits):
    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort
    indexed_prefix_sums = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]
    indexed_prefix_sums.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the best segment
    min_diff = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0
    
    # Step 4: Find the closest pair of prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_diff = abs(indexed_prefix_sums[i][0] - indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][0])
        start_index = min(indexed_prefix_sums[i][1], indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][1])
        end_index = max(indexed_prefix_sums[i][1], indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][1]) - 1
        
        # Check if we found a better segment
        if current_diff < min_diff or (current_diff == min_diff and (end_index - start_index) > (best_end - best_start)):
            min_diff = current_diff
            best_start = start_index
            best_end = end_index
    
    # Step 5: Output the result
    print(min_diff)
    print(best_start + 1, best_end + 1)

# Example usage:
# N = 8
# profits = [-20, 90, -30, -20, 80, -70, -60, 125]
# find_best_segment(N, profits)
```

This code efficiently finds the segment with the sum closest to zero by leveraging prefix sums and sorting, ensuring it runs in O(N log N) time, which is suitable for the given constraints.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was efficiently computing the sum of elements in a subarray for multiple queries. The key strategy was to use a prefix sum array, which allows for constant-time computation of subarray sums. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it reduces the time complexity of each query from linear to constant time.

    The solution involved:
    1. Constructing a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.
    2. For each query, using the prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of elements between two indices by subtracting the prefix sum at the start index from the prefix sum at the end index.

    This method proved efficient and effective, handling the constraints well. The problem reinforced the utility of prefix sums in scenarios involving repeated range sum queries. The implementation was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. The solution was verified to work correctly with the provided test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. The task is to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same minimum absolute sum, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum for each station.
   - Use a dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - For each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted, results in a sum closest to zero.
   - Keep track of the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment that achieves this sum.

3. **Iterate and Compare**:
   - As you iterate through the prefix sums, calculate the difference between the current prefix sum and any previously seen prefix sum.
   - If this difference is closer to zero than any previously found, update the minimum sum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same as a previously found minimum but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = infinity
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    for i from 1 to N:
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + profits[i-1]
    
    for i from 0 to N:
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]
        
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}

    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check if this prefix sum has been seen before
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

This solution efficiently finds the segment with the sum closest to zero using prefix sums and a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.

 ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. The task is to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same minimum absolute sum, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum for each station.
   - Use a dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - For each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted, results in a sum closest to zero.
   - Keep track of the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment that achieves this sum.

3. **Iterate and Compare**:
   - As you iterate through the prefix sums, calculate the difference between the current prefix sum and any previously seen prefix sum.
   - If this difference is closer to zero than any previously found, update the minimum sum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same as a previously found minimum but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = infinity
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    for i from 1 to N:
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + profits[i-1]
    
    for i from 0 to N:
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]
        
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check if this prefix sum has been seen before
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

This solution efficiently finds the segment with the sum closest to zero using prefix sums and a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. The task is to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same minimum absolute sum, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum for each station.
   - Use a dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - For each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted, results in a sum closest to zero.
   - Keep track of the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment that achieves this sum.

3. **Iterate and Compare**:
   - As you iterate through the prefix sums, calculate the difference between the current prefix sum and any previously seen prefix sum.
   - If this difference is closer to zero than any previously found, update the minimum sum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same as a previously found minimum but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is correctly calculated. It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Tracking Prefix Sums**: The solution uses a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum. This is correct because it helps in identifying subarrays with a sum of zero.

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between current and previous prefix sums.
   - However, the logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the current prefix sum has been seen before, which is not sufficient to find the closest sum to zero.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Sum**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the prefix sum itself should be minimized. Instead, we should be looking for the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which represents the sum of a subarray.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The solution does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum difference is zero, which is the ideal case.

3. **Initialization of `min_abs_sum`**: The initial value of `min_abs_sum` is set to infinity, which is correct, but the logic to update it is not properly implemented.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

### Revised Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check all previous prefix sums to find the closest to zero
        for j in range(i):
            subarray_sum = current_sum - prefix_sum[j]
            if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and (i - j) > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
                best_start = j
                best_end = i - 1

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

This revised solution correctly calculates the minimum absolute sum of any subarray and outputs the correct segment indices.

The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. The task is to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same minimum absolute sum, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum for each station.
   - Use a dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - For each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted, results in a sum closest to zero.
   - Keep track of the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment that achieves this sum.

3. **Iterate and Compare**:
   - As you iterate through the prefix sums, calculate the difference between the current prefix sum and any previously seen prefix sum.
   - If this difference is closer to zero than any previously found, update the minimum sum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same as a previously found minimum but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = infinity
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    for i from 1 to N:
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + profits[i-1]
    
    for i from 0 to N:
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]
        
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check if this prefix sum has been seen before
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input

data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

This solution efficiently finds the segment with the sum closest to zero using prefix sums and a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is correctly calculated. It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Tracking Prefix Sums**: The solution uses a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum. This is correct because it helps in identifying subarrays with a sum of zero.

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between current and previous prefix sums.
   - However, the logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the current prefix sum has been seen before, which is not sufficient to find the closest sum to zero.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Sum**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the prefix sum itself should be minimized. Instead, we should be looking for the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which represents the sum of a subarray.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The solution does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum difference is zero, which is the ideal case.

3. **Initialization of `min_abs_sum`**: The initial value of `min_abs_sum` is set to infinity, which is correct, but the logic to update it is not properly implemented.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

### Revised Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check all previous prefix sums to find the closest to zero
        for j in range(i):
            subarray_sum = current_sum - prefix_sum[j]
            if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and (i - j) > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
                best_start = j
                best_end = i - 1

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

This revised solution correctly calculates the minimum absolute sum of any subarray and outputs the correct segment indices.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was efficiently computing the sum of elements in a subarray for multiple queries. The key strategy was to use a prefix sum array, which allows for constant-time computation of subarray sums. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it reduces the time complexity of each query from linear to constant time.

    The solution involved:
    1. Constructing a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.
    2. For each query, using the prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of elements between two indices by subtracting the prefix sum at the start index from the prefix sum at the end index.

    This method proved efficient and effective, handling the constraints well. The problem reinforced the utility of prefix sums in scenarios involving repeated range sum queries. The implementation was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. The solution was verified to work correctly with the provided test cases.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. The task is to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same minimum absolute sum, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum for each station.
   - Use a dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - For each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted, results in a sum closest to zero.
   - Keep track of the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment that achieves this sum.

3. **Iterate and Compare**:
   - As you iterate through the prefix sums, calculate the difference between the current prefix sum and any previously seen prefix sum.
   - If this difference is closer to zero than any previously found, update the minimum sum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same as a previously found minimum but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = infinity
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    for i from 1 to N:
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + profits[i-1]
    
    for i from 0 to N:
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]
        
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check if this prefix sum has been seen before
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

This solution efficiently finds the segment with the sum closest to zero using prefix sums and a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is correctly calculated. It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Tracking Prefix Sums**: The solution uses a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum. This is correct because it helps in identifying subarrays with a sum of zero.

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between current and previous prefix sums.
   - However, the logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the current prefix sum has been seen before, which is not sufficient to find the closest sum to zero.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Sum**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the prefix sum itself should be minimized. Instead, we should be looking for the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which represents the sum of a subarray.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The solution does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum difference is zero, which is the ideal case.

3. **Initialization of `min_abs_sum`**: The initial value of `min_abs_sum` is set to infinity, which is correct, but the logic to update it is not properly implemented.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

### Revised Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check all previous prefix sums to find the closest to zero
        for j in range(i):
            subarray_sum = current_sum - prefix_sum[j]
            if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and (i - j) > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
                best_start = j
                best_end = i - 1

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints

-----Sample Input-----
8
-20
90
-30
-20
80
-70
-60
125

-----Sample Output-----

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. The task is to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same minimum absolute sum, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum for each station.
   - Use a dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - For each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted, results in a sum closest to zero.
   - Keep track of the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment that achieves this sum.

3. **Iterate and Compare**:
   - As you iterate through the prefix sums, calculate the difference between the current prefix sum and any previously seen prefix sum.
   - If this difference is closer to zero than any previously found, update the minimum sum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same as a previously found minimum but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = infinity
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    for i from 1 to N:
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + profits[i-1]
    
    for i from 0 to N:
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]
        
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check if this prefix sum has been seen before
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

This solution efficiently finds the segment with the sum closest to zero using prefix sums and a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is correctly calculated. It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Tracking Prefix Sums**: The solution uses a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum. This is correct because it helps in identifying subarrays with a sum of zero.

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between current and previous prefix sums.
   - However, the logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the current prefix sum has been seen before, which is not sufficient to find the closest sum to zero.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Sum**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the prefix sum itself should be minimized. Instead, we should be looking for the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which represents the sum of a subarray.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The solution does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum difference is zero, which is the ideal case.

3. **Initialization of `min_abs_sum`**: The initial value of `min_abs_sum` is set to infinity, which is correct, but the logic to update it is not properly implemented.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

### Revised Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check all previous prefix sums to find the closest to zero
        for j in range(i):
            subarray_sum = current_sum - prefix_sum[j]
            if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and (i - j) > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
                best_start = j
                best_end = i - 1

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was efficiently computing the sum of elements in a subarray for multiple queries. The key strategy was to use a prefix sum array, which allows for constant-time computation of subarray sums. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it reduces the time complexity of each query from linear to constant time.

    The solution involved:
    1. Constructing a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.
    2. For each query, using the prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of elements between two indices by subtracting the prefix sum at the start index from the prefix sum at the end index.

    This method proved efficient and effective, handling the constraints well. The problem reinforced the utility of prefix sums in scenarios involving repeated range sum queries. The implementation was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. The solution was verified to work correctly with the provided test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] Let's address the issue with the previous solution and provide a corrected version. The main problem was the incorrect handling of prefix sums and the logic to find the subarray with the sum closest to zero. Here's the corrected approach:

 Let's address the issue with the previous solution and provide a corrected version. The main problem was the incorrect handling of prefix sums and the logic to find the subarray with the sum closest to zero. Here's the corrected approach:

### Correct Approach

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Calculate the prefix sums for the array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Sort prefix sums with their indices
    sorted_prefix = sorted((value, index) for index, value in enumerate(prefix_sum))

    # Iterate over sorted prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_sum, current_index = sorted_prefix[i]
        previous_sum, previous_index = sorted_prefix[i - 1]
        
        subarray_sum = current_sum - previous_sum
        if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and abs(current_index - previous_index) > (best_end - best_start)):
            min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
            best_start = min(current_index, previous_index)
            best_end = max(current_index, previous_index) - 1

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. The task is to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same minimum absolute sum, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum for each station.
   - Use a dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - For each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted, results in a sum closest to zero.
   - Keep track of the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment that achieves this sum.

3. **Iterate and Compare**:
   - As you iterate through the prefix sums, calculate the difference between the current prefix sum and any previously seen prefix sum.
   - If this difference is closer to zero than any previously found, update the minimum sum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same as a previously found minimum but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = infinity
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    for i from 1 to N:
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + profits[i-1]
    
    for i from 0 to N:
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]
        
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}

    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check if this prefix sum has been seen before
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index

# Output the result

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is correctly calculated. It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Tracking Prefix Sums**: The solution uses a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum. This is correct because it helps in identifying subarrays with a sum of zero.

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between current and previous prefix sums.
   - However, the logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the current prefix sum has been seen before, which is not sufficient to find the closest sum to zero.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Sum**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the prefix sum itself should be minimized. Instead, we should be looking for the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which represents the sum of a subarray.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The solution does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum difference is zero, which is the ideal case.

3. **Initialization of `min_abs_sum`**: The initial value of `min_abs_sum` is set to infinity, which is correct, but the logic to update it is not properly implemented.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

### Revised Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check all previous prefix sums to find the closest to zero
        for j in range(i):
            subarray_sum = current_sum - prefix_sum[j]
            if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and (i - j) > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
                best_start = j
                best_end = i - 1

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Sum**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the prefix sum itself should be minimized. Instead, we should be looking for the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which represents the sum of a subarray.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The solution does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum difference is zero, which is the ideal case.

3. **Initialization of `min_abs_sum`**: The initial value of `min_abs_sum` is set to infinity, which is correct, but the logic to update it is not properly implemented.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

### Revised Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check all previous prefix sums to find the closest to zero
        for j in range(i):
            subarray_sum = current_sum - prefix_sum[j]
            if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and (i - j) > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
                best_start = j
                best_end = i - 1

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's address the issue with the previous solution and provide a corrected version. The main problem was the incorrect handling of prefix sums and the logic to find the subarray with the sum closest to zero. Here's the corrected approach:

### Correct Approach

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Calculate the prefix sums for the array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:

   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

Here's the corrected Python code:

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is correctly calculated. It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Sorting Prefix Sums**: The solution sorts the prefix sums along with their indices. This is a correct approach because it allows us to find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray with the sum closest to zero.

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between consecutive sorted prefix sums.
   - The logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is mostly correct, but there is a subtle issue with the calculation of the subarray sum.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Sign of the Subarray Sum**: The solution calculates the absolute value of the subarray sum correctly, but the expected output requires the actual sum (which can be negative) to be printed.

2. **Output of the Sum**: The solution outputs the absolute value of the sum, but the problem statement requires the actual sum (which can be negative) to be printed.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Sort Prefix Sums with Indices**: Sort the prefix sums along with their indices.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the sorted prefix sums and for each pair of consecutive prefix sums, calculate the subarray sum.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the actual subarray sum (not its absolute value) and the 1-based indices of the segment.

### Revised Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Sort prefix sums with their indices
    sorted_prefix = sorted((value, index) for index, value in enumerate(prefix_sum))

    # Initialize variables to track the best segment
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0
    best_sum = 0

    # Iterate over sorted prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_sum, current_index = sorted_prefix[i]
        previous_sum, previous_index = sorted_prefix[i - 1]
        
        subarray_sum = current_sum - previous_sum
        if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and abs(current_index - previous_index) > (best_end - best_start)):
            min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
            best_sum = subarray_sum
            best_start = min(current_index, previous_index)
            best_end = max(current_index, previous_index) - 1

    # Return the actual subarray sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return best_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum sum of any subarray and outputs the correct segment indices, ensuring that the actual sum (which can be negative) is printed.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. The task is to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same minimum absolute sum, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum for each station.
   - Use a dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - For each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted, results in a sum closest to zero.
   - Keep track of the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment that achieves this sum.

3. **Iterate and Compare**:
   - As you iterate through the prefix sums, calculate the difference between the current prefix sum and any previously seen prefix sum.
   - If this difference is closer to zero than any previously found, update the minimum sum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same as a previously found minimum but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = infinity
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    for i from 1 to N:
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + profits[i-1]
    
    for i from 0 to N:
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]
        
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)

                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1
```

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's address the issue with the previous solution and provide a corrected version. The main problem was the incorrect handling of prefix sums and the logic to find the subarray with the sum closest to zero. Here's the corrected approach:

### Correct Approach

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Calculate the prefix sums for the array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check if this prefix sum has been seen before
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum - prefix_sum[start_index]) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum - prefix_sum[start_index]) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum - prefix_sum[start_index])
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is correctly calculated. It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Tracking Prefix Sums**: The solution uses a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum. This is correct because it helps in identifying subarrays with a sum of zero.

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between current and previous prefix sums.
   - However, the logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the current prefix sum has been seen before, which is not sufficient to find the closest sum to zero.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Sum**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the prefix sum itself should be minimized. Instead, we should be looking for the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which represents the sum of a subarray.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The solution does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum difference is zero, which is the ideal case.

3. **Initialization of `min_abs_sum`**: The initial value of `min_abs_sum` is set to infinity, which is correct, but the logic to update it is not properly implemented.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check all previous prefix sums to find the closest to zero
        for j in range(i):
            subarray_sum = current_sum - prefix_sum[j]

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves:
    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.
    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.
    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):
        max_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        n = len(strengths)
    
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            # Start a new subsequence with the current element
            current_sum = strengths[i]
            i += 1
        
            # Alternate between adding and subtracting
            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:
                current_sum += strengths[i]
                i += 1
        
            # Update the maximum sum found
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
        return max_sum

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0
            index += 2
        
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
        
            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was efficiently computing the sum of elements in a subarray for multiple queries. The key strategy was to use a prefix sum array, which allows for constant-time computation of subarray sums. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it reduces the time complexity of each query from linear to constant time.

    The solution involved:
    1. Constructing a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.
    2. For each query, using the prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of elements between two indices by subtracting the prefix sum at the start index from the prefix sum at the end index.

    This method proved efficient and effective, handling the constraints well. The problem reinforced the utility of prefix sums in scenarios involving repeated range sum queries. The implementation was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. The solution was verified to work correctly with the provided test cases.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints

-----Sample Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. The task is to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same minimum absolute sum, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum for each station.
   - Use a dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - For each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted, results in a sum closest to zero.
   - Keep track of the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment that achieves this sum.

3. **Iterate and Compare**:
   - As you iterate through the prefix sums, calculate the difference between the current prefix sum and any previously seen prefix sum.
   - If this difference is closer to zero than any previously found, update the minimum sum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same as a previously found minimum but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = infinity
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    for i from 1 to N:
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + profits[i-1]
    
    for i from 0 to N:
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]
        
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check if this prefix sum has been seen before
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

This solution efficiently finds the segment with the sum closest to zero using prefix sums and a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is correctly calculated. It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Tracking Prefix Sums**: The solution uses a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum. This is correct because it helps in identifying subarrays with a sum of zero.

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between current and previous prefix sums.
   - However, the logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the current prefix sum has been seen before, which is not sufficient to find the closest sum to zero.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Sum**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the prefix sum itself should be minimized. Instead, we should be looking for the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which represents the sum of a subarray.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The solution does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum difference is zero, which is the ideal case.

3. **Initialization of `min_abs_sum`**: The initial value of `min_abs_sum` is set to infinity, which is correct, but the logic to update it is not properly implemented.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

### Revised Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check all previous prefix sums to find the closest to zero
        for j in range(i):
            subarray_sum = current_sum - prefix_sum[j]
            if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and (i - j) > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
                best_start = j
                best_end = i - 1

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's address the issue with the previous solution and provide a corrected version. The main problem was the incorrect handling of prefix sums and the logic to find the subarray with the sum closest to zero. Here's the corrected approach:

### Correct Approach

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Calculate the prefix sums for the array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Sort prefix sums with their indices
    sorted_prefix = sorted((value, index) for index, value in enumerate(prefix_sum))

    # Iterate over sorted prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_sum, current_index = sorted_prefix[i]
        previous_sum, previous_index = sorted_prefix[i - 1]
        
        subarray_sum = current_sum - previous_sum
        if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and abs(current_index - previous_index) > (best_end - best_start)):
            min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
            best_start = min(current_index, previous_index)
            best_end = max(current_index, previous_index) - 1

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum absolute sum of any subarray and outputs the correct segment indices. The logic has been adjusted to ensure that we are correctly identifying the subarray with the sum closest to zero.

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is correctly calculated. It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Sorting Prefix Sums**: The solution sorts the prefix sums along with their indices. This is a correct approach because it allows us to find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray with the sum closest to zero.

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between consecutive sorted prefix sums.
   - The logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is mostly correct, but there is a subtle issue with the calculation of the subarray sum.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Sign of the Subarray Sum**: The solution calculates the absolute value of the subarray sum correctly, but the expected output requires the actual sum (which can be negative) to be printed.

2. **Output of the Sum**: The solution outputs the absolute value of the sum, but the problem statement requires the actual sum (which can be negative) to be printed.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Sort Prefix Sums with Indices**: Sort the prefix sums along with their indices.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the sorted prefix sums and for each pair of consecutive prefix sums, calculate the subarray sum.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the actual subarray sum (not its absolute value) and the 1-based indices of the segment.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem revolves around finding a contiguous subarray with a sum closest to zero. This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using prefix sums and sorting. The key idea is to leverage the prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray and then find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray with the sum closest to zero.

#### Strategies and Challenges
Initially, the approach involved calculating prefix sums and using a dictionary to track their indices. The idea was to find the smallest absolute difference between any two prefix sums. However, the solution failed to correctly output the actual subarray sum (which can be negative) and instead outputted its absolute value. This was a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

The correct strategy involved sorting the prefix sums along with their indices and iterating over them to find the smallest difference. The challenge was ensuring that the actual subarray sum was outputted, not its absolute value.

#### Fixing Errors
The main error was in the output of the subarray sum. The solution was adjusted to track the actual subarray sum and ensure it was printed correctly. Sorting the prefix sums allowed for an efficient comparison of consecutive sums to find the minimum difference.

#### Final Solution
The final solution involves:
1. Calculating prefix sums.
2. Sorting the prefix sums with their indices.
3. Iterating over sorted prefix sums to find the smallest difference.
4. Outputting the actual subarray sum and the correct segment indices.

This approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct, handling large inputs within the constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints

-----Sample Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. The task is to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same minimum absolute sum, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum for each station.
   - Use a dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - For each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted, results in a sum closest to zero.
   - Keep track of the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment that achieves this sum.

3. **Iterate and Compare**:
   - As you iterate through the prefix sums, calculate the difference between the current prefix sum and any previously seen prefix sum.
   - If this difference is closer to zero than any previously found, update the minimum sum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same as a previously found minimum but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = infinity
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    for i from 1 to N:
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + profits[i-1]
    
    for i from 0 to N:
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]
        
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check if this prefix sum has been seen before
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)

# Find the minimum segment

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is correctly calculated. It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Tracking Prefix Sums**: The solution uses a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum. This is correct because it helps in identifying subarrays with a sum of zero.

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between current and previous prefix sums.
   - However, the logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the current prefix sum has been seen before, which is not sufficient to find the closest sum to zero.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Sum**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the prefix sum itself should be minimized. Instead, we should be looking for the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which represents the sum of a subarray.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The solution does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum difference is zero, which is the ideal case.

3. **Initialization of `min_abs_sum`**: The initial value of `min_abs_sum` is set to infinity, which is correct, but the logic to update it is not properly implemented.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

### Revised Solution

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check all previous prefix sums to find the closest to zero
        for j in range(i):
            subarray_sum = current_sum - prefix_sum[j]
            if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and (i - j) > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
                best_start = j
                best_end = i - 1

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's address the issue with the previous solution and provide a corrected version. The main problem was the incorrect handling of prefix sums and the logic to find the subarray with the sum closest to zero. Here's the corrected approach:

### Correct Approach

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Calculate the prefix sums for the array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_minimum_segment(N, profits):
    # Initialize prefix sum array and a dictionary to store first occurrence of each prefix sum
    prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
    prefix_index = {}
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check if this prefix sum has been seen before
        if current_sum in prefix_index:
            start_index = prefix_index[current_sum]
            segment_length = i - start_index
            if abs(current_sum - prefix_sum[start_index]) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum - prefix_sum[start_index]) == min_abs_sum and segment_length > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum - prefix_sum[start_index])
                best_start = start_index
                best_end = i - 1
        else:
            prefix_index[current_sum] = i

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Find the minimum segment
min_sum, start, end = find_minimum_segment(N, profits)

# Output the result
print(min_sum)
print(start, end)
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum absolute sum of any subarray and outputs the correct segment indices. The logic has been adjusted to ensure that we are correctly identifying the subarray with the sum closest to zero.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is correctly calculated. It stores cumulative sums up to each index, which allows us to compute the sum of any subarray efficiently.

2. **Tracking Prefix Sums**: The solution uses a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum. This is correct because it helps in identifying subarrays with a sum of zero.

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between current and previous prefix sums.
   - However, the logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the current prefix sum has been seen before, which is not sufficient to find the closest sum to zero.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Sum**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the prefix sum itself should be minimized. Instead, we should be looking for the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which represents the sum of a subarray.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The solution does not correctly handle the case where the prefix sum difference is zero, which is the ideal case.

3. **Initialization of `min_abs_sum`**: The initial value of `min_abs_sum` is set to infinity, which is correct, but the logic to update it is not properly implemented.

### Correct Approach

1. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: As before, calculate the prefix sums for the array.

2. **Track Prefix Sums with Indices**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its index. This helps in identifying the start of the subarray.

3. **Find Minimum Difference**:
   - Iterate over the prefix sums and for each prefix sum, check if there is a previous prefix sum that results in a smaller absolute difference.
   - Update the minimum absolute difference and the segment indices accordingly.

4. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.

    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0

    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]

    # Iterate over prefix sums to find the segment with sum closest to zero
    for i in range(N + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sum[i]

        # Check all previous prefix sums to find the closest to zero
        for j in range(i):
            subarray_sum = current_sum - prefix_sum[j]
            if abs(subarray_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(subarray_sum) == min_abs_sum and (i - j) > (best_end - best_start)):
                min_abs_sum = abs(subarray_sum)
                best_start = j
                best_end = i - 1

    # Return the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the segment
    return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1

3. **Finding the Closest Sum to Zero**:
   - The solution attempts to find the segment with the sum closest to zero by checking the difference between consecutive sorted prefix sums.
   - The logic to update the minimum absolute sum and the segment indices is mostly correct, but there is a subtle issue with the calculation of the subarray sum.

### Mistakes in the Solution

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:

### Key Insights

1. **Prefix Sum and Sorting**: The problem involves finding a subarray with a sum closest to zero. The use of prefix sums is crucial because it allows us to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. Sorting these prefix sums helps in finding the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray with the sum closest to zero.

2. **Binary Search with Bisect**: The official solution uses the `bisect` module to maintain a sorted list of prefix sums. This is a clever use of binary search to efficiently insert and find positions in the list, which helps in maintaining the order and quickly finding the closest sums.

3. **Handling Indices and Lengths**: The solution carefully tracks indices and lengths of subarrays to ensure that the longest subarray is chosen when multiple subarrays have the same sum closest to zero. This involves checking conditions and updating indices accordingly.

4. **Non-trivial Edge Cases**: The solution accounts for edge cases where the prefix sum differences are the same, ensuring that the longest subarray is selected. This requires careful handling of indices and conditions.

### Why the Official Solution Works

- **Efficiency**: The official solution efficiently handles large inputs by using prefix sums and binary search, which reduces the complexity compared to a naive approach that might involve checking all possible subarrays.
  
- **Correctness**: By maintaining a sorted list of prefix sums and using binary search, the solution ensures that the closest sums are found quickly and accurately. The careful handling of indices ensures that the correct subarray is selected.

### Lessons Learned

- **Use of Data Structures**: The use of a sorted list with binary search (via `bisect`) is a powerful technique for maintaining order and efficiently finding elements. This is particularly useful in problems involving range queries or closest value searches.

- **Attention to Detail**: Handling indices and ensuring the correct subarray is selected requires careful attention to detail, especially when dealing with conditions that involve both the sum and the length of subarrays.

- **Iterative Improvement**: The process of iteratively refining the solution based on test feedback highlights the importance of testing and debugging in problem-solving. Each iteration provides insights that help in converging towards the correct solution. 

Overall, the official solution provides a robust and efficient approach to solving the problem, leveraging advanced techniques like binary search and careful index management.
