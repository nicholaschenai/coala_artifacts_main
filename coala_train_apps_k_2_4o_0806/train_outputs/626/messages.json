There are n appetizers numbered from 0 to n-1 such that if the appetizers are arrayed in this order, they will display the message. The Chef plans to display them in this order on a table that can be viewed by all guests as they enter. The appetizers will only be served once all guests are seated.\n\nThe appetizers are not necessarily finished in the same order as they are numbered. So, when an appetizer is finished the Chef will write the number on a piece of paper and place it beside the appetizer on a counter between the kitchen and the restaurant. A server will retrieve this appetizer and place it in the proper location according to the number written beside it.\n\nThe Chef has a penchant for binary numbers. The number of appetizers created is a power of 2, say n = 2k. Furthermore, he has written the number of the appetizer in binary with exactly k bits. That is, binary numbers with fewer than k bits are padded on the left with zeros so they are written with exactly k bits.\n\nUnfortunately, this has unforseen complications. A binary number still \"looks\" binary when it is written upside down. For example, the binary number \"0101\" looks like \"1010\" when read upside down and the binary number \"110\" looks like \"011\" (the Chef uses simple vertical lines to denote a 1 bit). The Chef didn't realize that the servers would read the numbers upside down so he doesn't rotate the paper when he places it on the counter. Thus, when the server picks up an appetizer they place it the location indexed by the binary number when it is read upside down.\n\nYou are given the message the chef intended to display and you are to display the message that will be displayed after the servers move all appetizers to their locations based on the binary numbers they read.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T \u2264 25 indicating the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of a single line beginning with an integer 1 \u2264 k \u2264 16 followed by a string of precisely 2k characters. The integer and the string are separated by a single space. The string has no spaces and is composed only of lower case letters from `a` to `z`.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case you are to output the scrambled message on a single line.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n2 chef\n4 enjoyourapplepie\n\nOutput:\ncehf\neayejpuinpopolre\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The string represents a message that the chef intended to display using appetizers. Each appetizer is labeled with a binary number of `k` bits. However, the servers mistakenly read these binary numbers upside down. We need to determine the message that will actually be displayed when the servers place the appetizers according to the upside-down binary numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   - For each test case, we need to:\n     - Read the integer `k` and the string.\n     - For each index from `0` to `2^k - 1`, convert the index to a binary string of length `k`.\n     - Reverse the binary string to simulate reading it upside down.\n     - Convert the reversed binary string back to an integer to get the new index.\n     - Place the character from the original string at this new index in the result string.\n   - Output the scrambled message for each test case.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   For each test case:\n       Read k and the message\n       Initialize an empty list for the scrambled message of length 2^k\n       For each index i from 0 to 2^k - 1:\n           Convert i to a binary string of length k\n           Reverse the binary string\n           Convert the reversed binary string back to an integer (new_index)\n           Place the character at index i of the message into the scrambled message at new_index\n       Join the scrambled message list into a string\n       Print the scrambled message\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split('\\n')\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for case in range(1, T + 1):\n        # Read each test case\n        line = data[case]\n        k, message = line.split()\n        k = int(k)\n        \n        n = 2 ** k  # Calculate the number of appetizers\n        scrambled_message = [''] * n  # Initialize the scrambled message list\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            # Convert i to a binary string of length k\n            binary_str = format(i, f'0{k}b')\n            # Reverse the binary string\n            reversed_binary_str = binary_str[::-1]\n            # Convert the reversed binary string back to an integer\n            new_index = int(reversed_binary_str, 2)\n            # Place the character in the scrambled message\n            scrambled_message[new_index] = message[i]\n        \n        # Join the scrambled message list into a string\n        results.append(''.join(scrambled_message))\n    \n    # Print all results, one per line\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```"

The core concept here was understanding the function f(P) and how to manipulate permutations to achieve a specific sum.\n\n    The key strategy was to start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum of maximums, and then adjust it to decrease the sum to the desired K. This involved swapping elements to reduce the maximums in the sum while ensuring the sum does not drop below K.\n\n    One important realization was calculating the maximum and minimum possible values of f(P) for a given N. If K was outside this range, it was impossible to achieve, and the output should be -1. This check helped quickly eliminate impossible cases.\n\n    The solution involved iterating over the permutation and making swaps to adjust the sum. This approach was efficient and worked well within the constraints, as evidenced by the successful test results. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation properties and how to manipulate them to achieve specific outcomes.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem revolves around maximizing the alternating sum of a subsequence from a list of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select elements in such a way that this sum is maximized.\n\n    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes\n    Initially, I attempted to maintain two variables (`max_odd` and `max_even`) to track the maximum alternating sum based on index parity. This approach was flawed because the problem is not about alternating indices but about forming a subsequence with an alternating sum. The strategy did not correctly capture the essence of maximizing the alternating sum by selectively picking elements.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves:\n    - Iterating through the list and starting a new subsequence with the largest possible element.\n    - Alternating between adding and subtracting elements to maximize the sum.\n    - Continuously updating the maximum sum found.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in misunderstanding the problem's requirements regarding the alternating sum. The solution needed to focus on maximizing the sum by considering the sign changes between consecutive elements, rather than focusing on index parity. The corrected approach involved iterating through the list, starting a new subsequence when necessary, and updating the maximum sum based on the current subsequence's alternating sum.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n    The final solution correctly computes the maximum alternating sum for each test case by iterating through the list of strengths and updating the maximum possible alternating sum. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are added and the smallest possible values are subtracted, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(strengths):\n        max_sum = 0\n        current_sum = 0\n        n = len(strengths)\n    \n        i = 0\n        while i < n:\n            # Start a new subsequence with the current element\n            current_sum = strengths[i]\n            i += 1\n        \n            # Alternate between adding and subtracting\n            while i < n and strengths[i] * strengths[i - 1] < 0:\n                current_sum += strengths[i]\n                i += 1\n        \n            # Update the maximum sum found\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n    \n        return max_sum\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0\n            index += 2\n        \n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n        \n            result = max_alternating_sum(strengths)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly interpreting the alternating sum concept to form an optimal solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Given a number of test cases, each test case provides a power of 2, `k`, and a string of length `2^k`. The string represents a message that needs to be rearranged. The rearrangement is determined by reading the binary indices of the string upside down.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Binary Upside Down Reading**: \n   - For each index in the string, convert it to a binary number with `k` bits.\n   - Reverse the binary string to simulate reading it upside down.\n   - Convert the reversed binary string back to a decimal number to get the new index.\n\n2. **Rearrange the String**:\n   - For each character in the original string, place it in the position determined by the upside-down binary index.\n\n3. **Output the Rearranged String**:\n   - For each test case, output the rearranged string.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction rearrange_message(k, message):\n    n = 2^k\n    rearranged = array of size n\n    for i from 0 to n-1:\n        binary_index = binary representation of i with k bits\n        upside_down_index = reverse(binary_index)\n        new_index = decimal value of upside_down_index\n        rearranged[new_index] = message[i]\n    return join(rearranged)\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read k and message\n        result = rearrange_message(k, message)\n        print(result)\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef rearrange_message(k, message):\n    n = 2 ** k\n    rearranged = [''] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Convert i to a binary string with k bits\n        binary_index = format(i, f'0{k}b')\n        # Reverse the binary string to simulate upside down reading\n        upside_down_index = binary_index[::-1]\n        # Convert the reversed binary string back to a decimal number\n        new_index = int(upside_down_index, 2)\n        # Place the character in the new position\n        rearranged[new_index] = message[i]\n    return ''.join(rearranged)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split('\\n')\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        k, message = data[i].split()\n        k = int(k)\n        result = rearrange_message(k, message)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **rearrange_message**: This function takes `k` and the `message` as inputs. It calculates the number of characters `n` as `2^k`. For each index `i`, it computes the binary representation, reverses it, and converts it back to a decimal to find the new index. The character at the original index is placed at this new index in the rearranged list.\n- **main**: This function reads input, processes each test case using `rearrange_message`, and prints the results. It handles multiple test cases as specified."
