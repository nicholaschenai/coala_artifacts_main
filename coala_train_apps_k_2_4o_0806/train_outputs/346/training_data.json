    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. The core concept here is the use of a sliding window or two-pointer technique combined with a hashmap to efficiently track the number of odd numbers encountered in the subarrays.\n\nThe successful strategy involved maintaining a count of odd numbers seen so far using a hashmap. This allowed us to quickly determine how many subarrays end at a given index with exactly `k` odd numbers by checking if `odd_count - k` exists in the hashmap. This approach leverages the prefix sum concept, where the difference between the current count of odd numbers and `k` gives us the number of subarrays with the desired property.\n\nThe solution was implemented with a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient given the constraints. The key insight was recognizing that the problem could be reduced to counting subarrays with a specific difference in the number of odd numbers, which is efficiently handled using a hashmap.\n\nOverall, this problem reinforced the utility of prefix sums and hashmaps in solving subarray problems, especially when specific conditions (like a fixed number of odd numbers) need to be met.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The task is to find subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. This requires efficiently counting and managing the odd numbers in the array.\n\n2. **My Approach:**\n   - I used a hashmap to track the number of odd numbers encountered so far. This allowed me to efficiently calculate the number of subarrays ending at each index with exactly `k` odd numbers. The solution was implemented using a sliding window technique with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n3. **Official Solution Insights:**\n   - The official solution takes a different approach by focusing on the lengths of even-numbered segments between odd numbers. It calculates the number of possible subarrays by considering combinations of these segments.\n   - This approach is insightful because it breaks down the problem into manageable parts by focusing on the structure of the array (odd and even segments) rather than just counting odd numbers.\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - Both solutions effectively solve the problem with a time complexity of O(n). However, the official solution provides a unique perspective by leveraging the structure of the array, which can be a useful technique in similar problems.\n   - My solution is more straightforward in terms of implementation, using a hashmap to directly count subarrays, while the official solution requires understanding the combination of segments.\n\n5. **Takeaway:**\n   - It's beneficial to explore different perspectives and techniques when solving problems. The official solution's approach of segmenting the array and using combinations is a valuable strategy that can be applied to other problems involving subarray counts or conditions.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThe function calculates the number of contiguous subarrays within a given list of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. It uses a hashmap to keep track of the cumulative count of odd numbers encountered as it iterates through the list. For each number, it checks if there is a previously encountered cumulative odd count that, when subtracted by `k`, results in a valid subarray with exactly `k` odd numbers. The function updates the result count based on these findings and returns the total number of such subarrays.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to find subarrays with specific properties, such as a certain number of odd numbers, within a larger array. This problem is a classic example of using a hashmap to efficiently count occurrences of a condition (in this case, the number of odd numbers) and find subarrays that meet a specific criterion. This technique can be applied to other problems involving subarrays or subsequences with specific characteristics, such as finding subarrays with a given sum or product. It is particularly useful in competitive programming and algorithm design, where optimizing for time complexity is crucial, as demonstrated by the use of a hashmap to achieve an O(n) solution."
