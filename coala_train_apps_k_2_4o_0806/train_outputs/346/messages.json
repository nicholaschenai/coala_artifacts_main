The official solution provides a straightforward approach using factorials and combinatorial mathematics, which is similar to the approach I took, but with some differences in implementation.\n\n    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n    1. **Factorial Calculation**:\n       - The official solution uses Python's `math.factorial` to compute factorials directly. This is a simple and effective way to handle factorials, especially when the constraints are manageable.\n\n    2. **Combinatorial Logic**:\n       - The solution calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from the `I-1` elements less than `I` using a loop to compute the binomial coefficient. This is done by iteratively multiplying and dividing to avoid large intermediate values, which is a practical approach to handle large numbers without overflow.\n\n    3. **Power of Two**:\n       - The number of ways to choose any subset of numbers greater than `I` is calculated as `2^(N-I)`, which is consistent with my approach. This is efficiently computed using exponentiation.\n\n    4. **Modulo Operation**:\n       - The result is taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to ensure it fits within standard integer limits, which is crucial for large computations.\n\n    ### Reflection:\n\n    - The official solution is insightful in its use of direct factorial computation and iterative calculation of binomial coefficients, which avoids the need for precomputing factorials and inverse factorials. This can be more efficient in terms of space when the number of queries is large but the range of `N` is not too extensive.\n    - My approach precomputed factorials and inverse factorials to quickly compute binomial coefficients, which is beneficial when `N` is large and many queries are involved. However, the official solution's method of calculating binomial coefficients on-the-fly is a good alternative when memory usage is a concern.\n    - Both solutions effectively handle the constraints and provide correct results, but the official solution's simplicity in handling factorials and binomial coefficients is a valuable technique to remember for similar problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be made to sum to zero by performing operations that decrease each element by its index. The key insight is that the sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices for it to be possible to adjust the sequence to zero.\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    1. **Operations and Indices**: The operation allows us to decrease each element by its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by multiples of the sum of indices.\n\n    2. **Feasibility Check**: The sum of the sequence must be a multiple of the sum of indices. Additionally, the number of operations (`k`) required to make the sequence zero must be feasible for each element, meaning no element should become negative after applying the operations.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    - **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach was to check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. This was a partial solution but did not account for the feasibility of operations on individual elements.\n\n    - **Refined Strategy**: The refined approach involved checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices and ensuring that each element can be adjusted without becoming negative. This involved calculating `k` and verifying that `A[i] >= k * (i + 1)` for all elements.\n\n    - **Unexpected Errors**: The main error was assuming that checking the divisibility of the sum was sufficient. The solution needed to ensure that the operations could be applied to each element without making any element negative.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution correctly checks both the divisibility and feasibility of operations:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n        \n            sum_A = sum(A)\n            sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n            if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:\n                k = sum_A // sum_indices\n                possible = True\n                for i in range(N):\n                    if A[i] < k * (i + 1):\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                if possible:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of considering both global conditions (like divisibility) and local constraints (like non-negativity of elements) when solving problems involving operations on sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
