    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given an array of integers and a maximum jump distance `d`. Starting from any index in the array, we can jump to another index if the value at the current index is greater than the value at the target index, and all values between these indices are also smaller than the current index's value. We can jump forward or backward, but not beyond the array's bounds. The task is to determine the maximum number of indices we can visit by making such jumps.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. We will iterate over each index and calculate the maximum jumps possible by considering all valid forward and backward jumps within the distance `d`. We will use a recursive approach with memoization to avoid recalculating results for the same index.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function maxJumps(arr, d):\n       n = length of arr\n       dp = array of size n initialized to -1\n\n       function dfs(i):\n           if dp[i] is not -1:\n               return dp[i]\n           \n           max_jumps = 1\n           for each x from 1 to d:\n               if i + x < n and arr[i] > arr[i + x]:\n                   max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + dfs(i + x))\n               else:\n                   break\n           \n           for each x from 1 to d:\n               if i - x >= 0 and arr[i] > arr[i - x]:\n                   max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + dfs(i - x))\n               else:\n                   break\n           \n           dp[i] = max_jumps\n           return dp[i]\n\n       max_result = 0\n       for each i from 0 to n-1:\n           max_result = max(max_result, dfs(i))\n       \n       return max_result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxJumps(self, arr: List[int], d: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize the length of the array\n        n = len(arr)\n        # Create a dp array to store the maximum jumps from each index, initialized to -1\n        dp = [-1] * n\n\n        # Define a helper function for depth-first search with memoization\n        def dfs(i):\n            # If the result for this index is already computed, return it\n            if dp[i] != -1:\n                return dp[i]\n            \n            # Start with a minimum of 1 jump (the index itself)\n            max_jumps = 1\n            \n            # Check forward jumps within the distance d\n            for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                if i + x < n and arr[i] > arr[i + x]:\n                    max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + dfs(i + x))\n                else:\n                    break\n            \n            # Check backward jumps within the distance d\n            for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                if i - x >= 0 and arr[i] > arr[i - x]:\n                    max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + dfs(i - x))\n                else:\n                    break\n            \n            # Store the result in dp array\n            dp[i] = max_jumps\n            return dp[i]\n\n        # Initialize the maximum result\n        max_result = 0\n        # Compute the maximum jumps for each index\n        for i in range(n):\n            max_result = max(max_result, dfs(i))\n        \n        # Return the maximum number of indices that can be visited\n        return max_result\n```\n\nThis solution uses a depth-first search approach with memoization to efficiently calculate the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index.
