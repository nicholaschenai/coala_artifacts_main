1] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. \n    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).\n\n    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:\n    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.\n    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).\n    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.\n\n    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:\n    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.\n    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).\n\n    ## Related tasks\n\n    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence\n\n    This is in fact nearly the same problem.\n    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.\n\n    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.\n    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.\n\n    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences\n\n    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.\n    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.\n\n    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.\n    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.\n\n    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.\n\n    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence\n\n    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \\dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.\n\n    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    **Proof**:\n    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.\n\n    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.\n    We need to prove that $x = y$.\n\n    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.\n    Therefore we have $y \\ge x$.\n\n    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.\n    Suppose that $y > x$.\n    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.\n    We transform this in set in the following way:\n    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.\n    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.\n    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.\n\n    Thus it follows that $y = x$.\n\n    **Restoring the sequences**:\n    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.\n    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Longest increasing subsequence\n    Part: 1/3\n    # Longest increasing subsequence\n\n    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \\dots n-1]$.\n    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.\n\n    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \\dots i_k$ such that\n\n    $$i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k,\\quad\n    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \\dots < a[i_k]$$\n\n    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.\n    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.\n\n    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label=\"Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming\"}\n\n    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.\n    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.\n\n    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.\n\n    ### Finding the length\n\n    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \\dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.\n\n    !!! example\n\n        $$\\begin{array}{ll}\n        a &= \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\} \\\\\n        d &= \\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\\}\n        \\end{array}$$\n\n        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\\}$ or $\\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\\{0, 1\\}$ having length 2.\n\n    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.\n    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.\n\n    So let the current index be $i$.\n    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \\dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.\n    Then there are two options:\n\n    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.\n\n    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.\n        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.\n\n        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.\n        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.\n  \n        $$d[i] = \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(1, \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)\\right)$$\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {\n                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;\n                    p[i] = j;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if (d[i] > ans) {\n                ans = d[i];\n                pos = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        vector<int> subseq;\n        while (pos != -1) {\n            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);\n            pos = p[pos];\n        }\n        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());\n        return subseq;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

This method is intuitive and effectively handles the constraints by recursively calculating the maximum jumps possible from each index.\n   - The official solution uses a stack-based approach to process the array in a single pass. It leverages a monotonic stack to efficiently determine the possible jumps by maintaining a list of indices in decreasing order of their values. This approach is more efficient in terms of time complexity as it avoids redundant calculations by processing each element only once.\n\n2. **Efficiency:**\n   - The official solution is more efficient because it processes the array in a single pass using a stack, which reduces the time complexity compared to the recursive DFS approach. The stack helps in quickly determining the valid jump indices by maintaining a sorted order of indices based on their values.\n\n3. **Key Insights from the Official Solution:**\n   - The use of a monotonic stack is a powerful technique for problems involving comparisons between elements in an array. It allows for efficient processing by maintaining a sorted order of elements, which can be used to quickly determine valid operations (in this case, jumps).\n   - The official solution cleverly appends a large number to the array to ensure that all elements are processed, which is a neat trick to handle edge cases without additional checks.\n\n4. **Learning Points:**\n   - Understanding and applying data structures like stacks can significantly optimize solutions for certain types of problems, especially those involving comparisons and constraints.\n   - The importance of exploring different algorithmic strategies (e.g., DFS vs. stack-based processing) to find the most efficient solution for a given problem.\n\nOverall, while my initial solution was correct and passed the test cases, the official solution provides a more efficient and elegant approach by leveraging a stack to streamline the process. This experience highlights the value of considering multiple strategies and the potential of data structures to optimize problem-solving."

It uses a depth-first search approach with memoization to explore possible jumps both forward and backward within the specified distance. The function initializes a dynamic programming array to store the maximum jumps possible from each index, ensuring that each index is only computed once. It iterates over each index in the array, updating the maximum number of jumps possible by considering all valid forward and backward jumps. Finally, it returns the highest number of indices that can be visited from any starting index.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the maximum number of positions that can be visited in a sequence with specific movement constraints. This problem is a variation of dynamic programming and graph traversal, where each position in the array can be thought of as a node, and valid jumps as edges. The solution involves using depth-first search (DFS) with memoization to efficiently compute the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index. This approach is applicable in situations where you need to optimize pathfinding with constraints, such as in game development for character movement, network routing with specific rules, or any scenario where you need to explore a space with limited movement options and conditions."
