## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4

Example 3:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000
1 <= weights[i] <= 500

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. We need to ship all these packages within a given number of days, `D`. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded on any day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to find the minimum possible weight capacity of the ship that allows us to ship all packages within `D` days.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - The minimum possible capacity of the ship must be at least the weight of the heaviest package, because we cannot split packages.
   - The maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights, which would allow us to ship all packages in one day.
   - We can use a binary search to find the minimum capacity between these two extremes.
   - For each capacity value in our binary search, we simulate the shipping process to check if it's possible to ship all packages within `D` days.
   - If a capacity allows shipping within `D` days, we try a smaller capacity; otherwise, we increase the capacity.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function canShip(weights, D, capacity):
       Initialize days to 1
       Initialize current_weight to 0
       For each weight in weights:
           If current_weight + weight > capacity:
               Increment days
               Set current_weight to 0
           Add weight to current_weight
       Return whether days <= D

   Define function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
       Set left to max(weights)
       Set right to sum(weights)
       While left < right:
           Set mid to (left + right) // 2
           If canShip(weights, D, mid):
               Set right to mid
           Else:
               Set left to mid + 1
       Return left
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    # Helper function to determine if we can ship within D days with given capacity
    def canShip(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:
        days = 1  # Start with the first day
        current_weight = 0  # Current weight on the ship for the current day
        
        for weight in weights:
            # If adding this package exceeds capacity, we need a new day
            if current_weight + weight > capacity:
                days += 1  # Increment the day count
                current_weight = 0  # Reset current weight for the new day
            
            current_weight += weight  # Add the package to the current day's load
        
        # Check if the number of days used is within the allowed days
        return days <= D

    # Main function to find the minimum ship capacity to ship within D days
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        left = max(weights)  # Minimum capacity must be at least the heaviest package
        right = sum(weights)  # Maximum capacity is the sum of all weights
        
        # Binary search for the minimum capacity
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2  # Midpoint of current capacity range
            
            # Check if we can ship with this capacity
            if self.canShip(weights, D, mid):
                right = mid  # Try a smaller capacity
            else:
                left = mid + 1  # Increase capacity
        
        return left  # The minimum capacity that works
```

This solution uses a binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity needed to ship all packages within the given number of days. The `canShip` helper function checks if a given capacity is sufficient to meet the requirement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is straightforward given the problem constraints. The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of problems and a limit on the number of days.

    Key insights from the problem-solving process:

    1. **Total Problems Calculation**: Both solutions start by calculating the total number of problems available by summing up the problems created by each setter. This is a crucial step as it determines the potential number of contests that can be hosted.

    2. **Maximum Contests Calculation**: The next step is to calculate the maximum number of contests that can be hosted by dividing the total number of problems by `K`, the number of problems required per contest. This gives the theoretical maximum number of contests.

    3. **Day Constraint**: The final step is to consider the constraint on the number of days (`D`). The actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of the theoretical maximum contests and `D`.

    The official solution is concise and directly implements these steps in a few lines of code. It uses Python's built-in functions to read input, calculate the necessary values, and output the result efficiently. The use of `min(P, D)` succinctly handles the day constraint, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.

    Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and using simple arithmetic operations to derive the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.
[/Reflection]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints on the number of problems and days. The key steps involved calculating the total number of problems available, determining the maximum possible contests based on the number of problems required per contest, and then considering the constraint of the number of days available to host these contests.

    The strategy that worked was straightforward: first, sum up all the problems from the setters to get the total number of problems. Then, calculate how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`). Finally, the actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of this number and the number of days (`D`), since only one contest can be hosted per day.

    The problem was relatively simple, and the solution was implemented efficiently by iterating over each test case, performing the calculations, and storing the results. The solution passed all test cases without any issues, indicating that the approach was correct and the implementation was robust. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and efficiently using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. These packages need to be shipped from one port to another within a given number of days, `D`. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded on any given day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to determine the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows all packages to be shipped within `D` days.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Constraints**: The ship's capacity must be at least as large as the heaviest package, as we cannot split packages. The maximum capacity could be the sum of all package weights if we were to ship all packages in one day.

2. **Binary Search Approach**: We can use binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity:
   - Set the lower bound (`low`) to the maximum weight of a single package.
   - Set the upper bound (`high`) to the sum of all package weights.
   - Perform binary search between these bounds to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within `D` days.

3. **Feasibility Check**: For a given capacity, simulate the shipping process to check if all packages can be shipped within `D` days:
   - Start with zero days and zero current load.
   - Iterate through the packages, adding each package to the current day's load.
   - If adding a package exceeds the current capacity, increment the day count and start a new load with the current package.
   - If the number of days exceeds `D`, the capacity is too small.

    low = max(weights)
    high = sum(weights)
    
    while low < high:

### Explanation of the Code

- **canShipInDays**: This helper function checks if it's possible to ship all packages within `D` days given a specific ship capacity. It iterates through the weights, simulating the loading process and counting the days needed.
  
- **shipWithinDays**: This function uses binary search to find the minimum ship capacity. It adjusts the search bounds based on whether the current mid-point capacity can ship all packages within `D` days. The search continues until the bounds converge, at which point `low` will be the minimum required capacity.

### Explanation of the Code

- **canShipInDays**: This helper function checks if it's possible to ship all packages within `D` days given a specific ship capacity. It iterates through the weights, simulating the loading process and counting the days needed.
  
- **shipWithinDays**: This function uses binary search to find the minimum ship capacity. It adjusts the search bounds based on whether the current mid-point capacity can ship all packages within `D` days. The search continues until the bounds converge, at which point `low` will be the minimum required capacity.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. These packages need to be shipped from one port to another within a given number of days, `D`. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded on any given day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to determine the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows all packages to be shipped within `D` days.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Constraints**: The ship's capacity must be at least as large as the heaviest package, as we cannot split packages. The maximum capacity could be the sum of all package weights if we were to ship all packages in one day.

2. **Binary Search Approach**: We can use binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity:
   - Set the lower bound (`low`) to the maximum weight of a single package.
   - Set the upper bound (`high`) to the sum of all package weights.
   - Perform binary search between these bounds to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within `D` days.

3. **Feasibility Check**: For a given capacity, simulate the shipping process to check if all packages can be shipped within `D` days:
   - Start with zero days and zero current load.
   - Iterate through the packages, adding each package to the current day's load.
   - If adding a package exceeds the current capacity, increment the day count and start a new load with the current package.
   - If the number of days exceeds `D`, the capacity is too small.

## Pseudocode

```
function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
    low = max(weights)
    high = sum(weights)
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if canShipInDays(weights, D, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    
    return low

function canShipInDays(weights, D, capacity):
    days = 1
    current_load = 0
    
    for weight in weights:
        if current_load + weight > capacity:
            days += 1
            current_load = 0
        current_load += weight
        
        if days > D:

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum ship capacity required to transport packages within a specified number of days, `D`. The key concept here was to use a binary search approach to efficiently find this minimum capacity. The problem tested understanding of binary search in a non-traditional context, where the search space was defined by the constraints of the problem (i.e., the maximum weight of a single package and the sum of all package weights).

The strategy involved:
1. Setting the initial search bounds: the lower bound (`low`) as the maximum weight of a single package, and the upper bound (`high`) as the sum of all package weights.
2. Using a helper function to simulate the shipping process and check if a given capacity could ship all packages within `D` days.
3. Adjusting the search bounds based on the feasibility of the current mid-point capacity, continuing until the bounds converge.

This approach was effective because it reduced the problem to a series of feasibility checks, which were efficiently handled by iterating through the package weights. The binary search ensured that the solution was found in logarithmic time relative to the range of possible capacities.

The implementation was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. The problem reinforced the utility of binary search in optimization problems where the solution space can be defined by problem constraints.

        return left

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution employ a binary search strategy to find the minimum ship capacity required to ship all packages within `D` days. The key insight is to use binary search over the possible range of ship capacities, which is bounded by the maximum single package weight and the sum of all package weights.

### Key Insights:

1. **Binary Search on Capacity**: Both solutions use binary search to efficiently determine the minimum capacity. The search space is defined between the maximum weight of a single package (since the ship must at least carry the heaviest package) and a calculated upper bound. My solution used the sum of all weights as the upper bound, while the official solution uses `max(weights) * len(weights) // D`, which is a tighter bound and can potentially reduce the number of iterations in the binary search.

2. **Feasibility Check**: Both solutions include a mechanism to check if a given capacity can ship all packages within `D` days. This involves simulating the loading process and counting the number of days required. If the number of days exceeds `D`, the capacity is too small.

3. **Efficiency**: The official solution's use of a tighter upper bound (`max(weights) * len(weights) // D`) is a subtle optimization that can lead to fewer iterations in the binary search, especially when `D` is large relative to the number of packages. This is a useful insight for similar problems where the search space can be intelligently reduced.

### Conclusion:

The official solution is slightly more optimized in terms of the initial bounds for the binary search, which can lead to faster convergence. This is a valuable lesson in problem-solving: always consider if the search space can be reduced based on problem constraints or characteristics. Overall, the approach and logic in both solutions are sound and effectively solve the problem.

## Instructions
- Read through the problem and solution carefully.
- Reason out, step by step, in what scenarios this knowledge would be useful.
- Focus on general patterns and situations to help connect this knowledge to new situations.
- Then, include a list of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair.

## Response format
Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"scenarios": {"description": "In what scenarios will this knowledge be useful? Answer in a paragraph.", "title": "Scenarios", "type": "string"}, "keywords": {"description": "List of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Keywords", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["scenarios", "keywords"]}
```

[Problem]
    A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
    The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
    Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
    Output: 15
    Explanation: 
    A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
    1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    2nd day: 6, 7
    3rd day: 8
    4th day: 9
    5th day: 10

    Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

    Example 2:
    Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
    1st day: 3, 2
    2nd day: 2, 4
    3rd day: 1, 4

    Example 3:
    Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    1st day: 1
    2nd day: 2
    3rd day: 3
    4th day: 1, 1

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000
    1 <= weights[i] <= 500

    from typing import List

    class Solution:
        def canShipInDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:
            days = 1
            current_load = 0
        
            for weight in weights:
                if current_load + weight > capacity:
                    days += 1
                    current_load = 0
                current_load += weight
            
                if days > D:
                    return False
        
            return True
    
        def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
            low = max(weights)
            high = sum(weights)
        
            while low < high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if self.canShipInDays(weights, D, mid):
                    high = mid
                else:
                    low = mid + 1
        
            return low
