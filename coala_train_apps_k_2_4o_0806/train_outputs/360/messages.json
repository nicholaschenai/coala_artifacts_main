We need to ship all these packages within a given number of days, `D`. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded on any day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to find the minimum possible weight capacity of the ship that allows us to ship all packages within `D` days.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - The minimum possible capacity of the ship must be at least the weight of the heaviest package, because we cannot split packages.\n   - The maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights, which would allow us to ship all packages in one day.\n   - We can use a binary search to find the minimum capacity between these two extremes.\n   - For each capacity value in our binary search, we simulate the shipping process to check if it's possible to ship all packages within `D` days.\n   - If a capacity allows shipping within `D` days, we try a smaller capacity; otherwise, we increase the capacity.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function canShip(weights, D, capacity):\n       Initialize days to 1\n       Initialize current_weight to 0\n       For each weight in weights:\n           If current_weight + weight > capacity:\n               Increment days\n               Set current_weight to 0\n           Add weight to current_weight\n       Return whether days <= D\n\n   Define function shipWithinDays(weights, D):\n       Set left to max(weights)\n       Set right to sum(weights)\n       While left < right:\n           Set mid to (left + right) // 2\n           If canShip(weights, D, mid):\n               Set right to mid\n           Else:\n               Set left to mid + 1\n       Return left\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    # Helper function to determine if we can ship within D days with given capacity\n    def canShip(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:\n        days = 1  # Start with the first day\n        current_weight = 0  # Current weight on the ship for the current day\n        \n        for weight in weights:\n            # If adding this package exceeds capacity, we need a new day\n            if current_weight + weight > capacity:\n                days += 1  # Increment the day count\n                current_weight = 0  # Reset current weight for the new day\n            \n            current_weight += weight  # Add the package to the current day's load\n        \n        # Check if the number of days used is within the allowed days\n        return days <= D\n\n    # Main function to find the minimum ship capacity to ship within D days\n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:\n        left = max(weights)  # Minimum capacity must be at least the heaviest package\n        right = sum(weights)  # Maximum capacity is the sum of all weights\n        \n        # Binary search for the minimum capacity\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2  # Midpoint of current capacity range\n            \n            # Check if we can ship with this capacity\n            if self.canShip(weights, D, mid):\n                right = mid  # Try a smaller capacity\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1  # Increase capacity\n        \n        return left  # The minimum capacity that works\n```\n\nThis solution uses a binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity needed to ship all packages within the given number of days.

The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of problems and a limit on the number of days.\n\n    Key insights from the problem-solving process:\n\n    1. **Total Problems Calculation**: Both solutions start by calculating the total number of problems available by summing up the problems created by each setter. This is a crucial step as it determines the potential number of contests that can be hosted.\n\n    2. **Maximum Contests Calculation**: The next step is to calculate the maximum number of contests that can be hosted by dividing the total number of problems by `K`, the number of problems required per contest. This gives the theoretical maximum number of contests.\n\n    3. **Day Constraint**: The final step is to consider the constraint on the number of days (`D`). The actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of the theoretical maximum contests and `D`.\n\n    The official solution is concise and directly implements these steps in a few lines of code. It uses Python's built-in functions to read input, calculate the necessary values, and output the result efficiently. The use of `min(P, D)` succinctly handles the day constraint, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.\n\n    Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and using simple arithmetic operations to derive the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints on the number of problems and days. The key steps involved calculating the total number of problems available, determining the maximum possible contests based on the number of problems required per contest, and then considering the constraint of the number of days available to host these contests.\n\n    The strategy that worked was straightforward: first, sum up all the problems from the setters to get the total number of problems. Then, calculate how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`). Finally, the actual number of contests that can be hosted is the minimum of this number and the number of days (`D`), since only one contest can be hosted per day.\n\n    The problem was relatively simple, and the solution was implemented efficiently by iterating over each test case, performing the calculations, and storing the results. The solution passed all test cases without any issues, indicating that the approach was correct and the implementation was robust. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and efficiently using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Our task is to determine the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows all packages to be shipped within `D` days.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: The ship's capacity must be at least as large as the heaviest package, as we cannot split packages. The maximum capacity could be the sum of all package weights if we were to ship all packages in one day.\n\n2. **Binary Search Approach**: We can use binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity:\n   - Set the lower bound (`low`) to the maximum weight of a single package.\n   - Set the upper bound (`high`) to the sum of all package weights.\n   - Perform binary search between these bounds to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within `D` days.\n\n3. **Feasibility Check**: For a given capacity, simulate the shipping process to check if all packages can be shipped within `D` days:\n   - Start with zero days and zero current load.\n   - Iterate through the packages, adding each package to the current day's load.\n   - If adding a package exceeds the current capacity, increment the day count and start a new load with the current package.\n   - If the number of days exceeds `D`, the capacity is too small.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction shipWithinDays(weights, D):\n    low = max(weights)\n    high = sum(weights)\n    \n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if canShipInDays(weights, D, mid):\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    \n    return low\n\nfunction canShipInDays(weights, D, capacity):\n    days = 1\n    current_load = 0\n    \n    for weight in weights:\n        if current_load + weight > capacity:\n            days += 1\n            current_load = 0\n        current_load += weight\n        \n        if days > D:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canShipInDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:\n        days = 1\n        current_load = 0\n        \n        for weight in weights:\n            if current_load + weight > capacity:\n                days += 1\n                current_load = 0\n            current_load += weight\n            \n            if days > D:\n                return False\n        \n        return True\n    \n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:\n        low = max(weights)\n        high = sum(weights)\n        \n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if self.canShipInDays(weights, D, mid):\n                high = mid\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        \n        return low\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **canShipInDays**: This helper function checks if it's possible to ship all packages within `D` days given a specific ship capacity.

The search space is defined between the maximum weight of a single package (since the ship must at least carry the heaviest package) and a calculated upper bound. My solution used the sum of all weights as the upper bound, while the official solution uses `max(weights) * len(weights) // D`, which is a tighter bound and can potentially reduce the number of iterations in the binary search.\n\n2. **Feasibility Check**: Both solutions include a mechanism to check if a given capacity can ship all packages within `D` days. This involves simulating the loading process and counting the number of days required. If the number of days exceeds `D`, the capacity is too small.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The official solution's use of a tighter upper bound (`max(weights) * len(weights) // D`) is a subtle optimization that can lead to fewer iterations in the binary search, especially when `D` is large relative to the number of packages. This is a useful insight for similar problems where the search space can be intelligently reduced.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe official solution is slightly more optimized in terms of the initial bounds for the binary search, which can lead to faster convergence. This is a valuable lesson in problem-solving: always consider if the search space can be reduced based on problem constraints or characteristics. Overall, the approach and logic in both solutions are sound and effectively solve the problem."
