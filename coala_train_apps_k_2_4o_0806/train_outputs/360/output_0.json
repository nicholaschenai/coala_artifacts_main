    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. These packages need to be shipped from one port to another within a given number of days, `D`. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded on any given day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to determine the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows all packages to be shipped within `D` days.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: The ship's capacity must be at least as large as the heaviest package, as we cannot split packages. The maximum capacity could be the sum of all package weights if we were to ship all packages in one day.\n\n2. **Binary Search Approach**: We can use binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity:\n   - Set the lower bound (`low`) to the maximum weight of a single package.\n   - Set the upper bound (`high`) to the sum of all package weights.\n   - Perform binary search between these bounds to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within `D` days.\n\n3. **Feasibility Check**: For a given capacity, simulate the shipping process to check if all packages can be shipped within `D` days:\n   - Start with zero days and zero current load.\n   - Iterate through the packages, adding each package to the current day's load.\n   - If adding a package exceeds the current capacity, increment the day count and start a new load with the current package.\n   - If the number of days exceeds `D`, the capacity is too small.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction shipWithinDays(weights, D):\n    low = max(weights)\n    high = sum(weights)\n    \n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if canShipInDays(weights, D, mid):\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    \n    return low\n\nfunction canShipInDays(weights, D, capacity):\n    days = 1\n    current_load = 0\n    \n    for weight in weights:\n        if current_load + weight > capacity:\n            days += 1\n            current_load = 0\n        current_load += weight\n        \n        if days > D:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canShipInDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:\n        days = 1\n        current_load = 0\n        \n        for weight in weights:\n            if current_load + weight > capacity:\n                days += 1\n                current_load = 0\n            current_load += weight\n            \n            if days > D:\n                return False\n        \n        return True\n    \n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:\n        low = max(weights)\n        high = sum(weights)\n        \n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if self.canShipInDays(weights, D, mid):\n                high = mid\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        \n        return low\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **canShipInDays**: This helper function checks if it's possible to ship all packages within `D` days given a specific ship capacity. It iterates through the weights, simulating the loading process and counting the days needed.\n  \n- **shipWithinDays**: This function uses binary search to find the minimum ship capacity. It adjusts the search bounds based on whether the current mid-point capacity can ship all packages within `D` days. The search continues until the bounds converge, at which point `low` will be the minimum required capacity.",
