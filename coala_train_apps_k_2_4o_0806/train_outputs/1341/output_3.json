    "raw_msg": "To solve the problem correctly, we need to focus on identifying the number of ways to remove a contiguous subsequence such that the remaining sequence is strictly increasing. The previous approach was incorrect because it didn't properly account for the conditions under which the remaining sequence is strictly increasing.\n\n### Correct Solution Approach\n\n1. **Identify Increasing Segments**:\n   - Traverse the sequence to identify segments where the sequence is strictly increasing. These segments are crucial because removing elements from these segments can potentially make the remaining sequence strictly increasing.\n\n2. **Calculate Possible Removals**:\n   - For each increasing segment, calculate the number of ways to remove a contiguous subsequence such that the remaining sequence is strictly increasing. This involves considering the boundaries of the segment and ensuring that the remaining sequence is still increasing.\n\n3. **Sum Up the Valid Removals**:\n   - Sum up all the valid removals for each segment to get the total number of ways for the sequence.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the entire sequence and calculate the number of ways to remove a contiguous subsequence such that the remaining sequence is strictly increasing. Here's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef calculateWays(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, A = test_case\n        \n        # Step 1: Identify increasing segments\n        increasing_segments = []\n        start = 0\n        while start < N:\n            end = start\n            while end + 1 < N and A[end] < A[end + 1]:\n                end += 1\n            if end > start:\n                increasing_segments.append((start, end))\n            start = end + 1\n        \n        # Step 2: Calculate possible removals\n        total_ways = 0\n        for start, end in increasing_segments:\n            length = end - start + 1\n            # We can remove any contiguous subsequence from this segment\n            # except the whole segment itself\n            total_ways += (length * (length + 1)) // 2 - 1\n        \n        results.append(total_ways)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index+1:index+1+N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n    \n    calculateWays(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Increasing Segments**: We identify segments of the array where the sequence is strictly increasing. These segments are the only parts where removing elements can potentially make the remaining sequence strictly increasing.\n  \n- **Calculate Removals**: For each increasing segment, calculate the number of ways to remove a contiguous subsequence. This is done by considering all possible contiguous subsequences within the segment, except for the entire segment itself.\n\n- **Output the Results**: For each test case, output the total number of valid removals.",
