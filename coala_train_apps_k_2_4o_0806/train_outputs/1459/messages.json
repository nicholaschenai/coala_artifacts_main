The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to a given number \\( M \\). The task is to compute this perimeter with high precision.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope \\( M \\):**\n   - A line with slope \\( M \\) can be represented as \\( y = Mx + c \\).\n   - For a rectangle with one side having this slope, the opposite side will have the same slope, and the other two sides will have a slope of \\(-1/M\\) (perpendicular).\n\n2. **Transforming the Coordinate System:**\n   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope \\( M \\).

This insight led to the realization that for each test case, the solution involves finding the largest integer `k` such that `k*k <= N`, where `N` is the number of boxes.\n\n    Initially, the solution failed due to incorrect input handling and function execution. The input was read inside a function that was never called, resulting in no output.

This approach ensures the script runs correctly when executed directly.\n\n    The use of `math.isqrt(N)` was a key improvement, providing an efficient and precise way to compute the integer square root, which is crucial for determining the number of rooms that can be completely tiled.

The core concept involved transforming the coordinate system to align with the given slope, which required understanding and applying geometric transformations, specifically rotations.\n\nInitially, the approach used a simple transformation that did not correctly align the rectangle with the slope \\( M \\). The correct approach involved using a rotation matrix derived from the angle \\(\\theta\\), where \\(\\theta = \\arctan(M)\\). This rotation matrix allowed us to transform the points such that the rectangle's sides were aligned with the specified slope.\n\nThe key learning was the importance of correctly applying geometric transformations to solve problems involving specific orientations. The use of trigonometric functions to derive the rotation matrix was crucial in aligning the coordinate system with the desired slope. This experience reinforced the need to carefully consider the mathematical foundations when dealing with geometric problems.\n\nThe final solution involved:\n- Calculating the angle \\(\\theta\\) using \\(\\arctan(M)\\).\n- Applying a rotation matrix to transform the points.\n- Finding the bounding box in the transformed space.\n- Calculating the perimeter of the rectangle using the dimensions of this bounding box.\n\nThis approach successfully solved the problem, demonstrating the effectiveness of using geometric transformations to handle orientation constraints."

The key challenge was to correctly transform the coordinate system to align the rectangle with the given slope.\n\n### Insights and Key Learnings:\n\n1. **Coordinate Transformation:**\n   - The official solution uses a transformation based on trigonometric identities to align the rectangle with the slope \\( M \\). This involves calculating the cosine and sine of the angle derived from the slope \\( M \\) using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{cosx} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}}, \\quad \\text{sinx} = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}}\n     \\]\n   - This transformation effectively rotates the coordinate system so that the rectangle's sides are aligned with the desired slope.\n\n2. **Bounding Box Calculation:**\n   - After transforming the points, the solution calculates the bounding box by finding the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates. This gives the dimensions of the rectangle in the transformed space.\n\n3. **Perimeter Calculation:**\n   - The perimeter is then calculated as \\( 2 \\times (\\text{width} + \\text{height}) \\), where width and height are the differences between the maximum and minimum transformed coordinates.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\n\n- My initial approach attempted to use a rotation matrix based on the angle \\(\\theta = \\arctan(M)\\). While this is mathematically sound, the implementation was incorrect due to errors in the transformation equations.\n- The official solution simplifies the transformation by directly using trigonometric identities, which is both efficient and easy to implement.\n- The key takeaway is the importance of correctly transforming the coordinate system to align with the desired geometric properties, and the use of trigonometric identities can simplify this process.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric transformations and their applications in computational geometry. The official solution provided a more straightforward and efficient method to achieve the desired alignment and calculation."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes an integer N and a float M, followed by N pairs of floating-point numbers representing coordinates. It calculates the angle theta using the arctangent of M and computes the cosine and sine of this angle. The function then rotates each coordinate pair by this angle and determines the minimum and maximum x and y values in the rotated coordinate space. It calculates the width and height of the bounding box in this rotated space and computes the perimeter of this box. Finally, it prints the perimeter with a precision of 12 decimal places.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to calculate the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a set of points, with a specific slope for one of its sides. This is particularly relevant in computational geometry, computer graphics, and geographic information systems where spatial data needs to be enclosed or bounded by geometric shapes. The problem also highlights the use of coordinate rotation to align the rectangle with a given slope, which is a common technique in geometry to simplify calculations. Additionally, understanding how to handle large input sizes efficiently with fast I/O operations is crucial in competitive programming and real-time data processing applications."
