## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Today, Chef has a fencing job at hand and has to fence up a surface covering N$N$ points. 
To minimize his work, he started looking for an algorithm that had him fence the least amount of length. 
He came up with the Convex Hull algorithm, but soon realized it gave him some random shape to fence. However, Chef likes rectangles and has a favourite number M$M$. 
Help him find the minimum perimeter he has to fence if he wants to fence a rectangle, with slope of one of the sides as M$M$, to cover all the points.

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains two integers N$N$ and M$M$, the number of points and the Chef's favourite Number.
- The next n lines contain two space separated integers X$X$ and Y$Y$, the coordinates of the point.

-----Output:-----
Print a single decimal number, denoting the perimeter of the rectangle. Answer will considered correct if it has absolute error less than 10âˆ’6$10^{-6}$.

We need to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a given set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to a given number \( M \). The task is to compute this perimeter with high precision.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope \( M \):**
   - A line with slope \( M \) can be represented as \( y = Mx + c \).
   - For a rectangle with one side having this slope, the opposite side will have the same slope, and the other two sides will have a slope of \(-1/M\) (perpendicular).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System:**
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope \( M \). This can be achieved using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: \( x' = x \cos(\theta) + y \sin(\theta) \)
     - New y-coordinate: \( y' = -x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta) \)
   - Here, \(\theta\) is the angle whose tangent is \( M \), i.e., \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).

3. **Finding the Bounding Rectangle:**
   - After transformation, find the minimum and maximum values of the new x and y coordinates.
   - The width of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
   - The height of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum transformed x and y coordinates.
3. For each point:
   - Compute the angle \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).
   - Transform the point using the rotation formulas.
   - Update the minimum and maximum transformed x and y coordinates.
4. Calculate the width and height of the bounding rectangle.
5. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

## Python Code

```python
import sys
import math

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = float(data[1])
    
    # Calculate the angle theta
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates
    min_x_prime = float('inf')
    max_x_prime = float('-inf')
    min_y_prime = float('inf')
    max_y_prime = float('-inf')
    
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = float(data[index])
        y = float(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Transform the coordinates
        x_prime = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta
        y_prime = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
        
        # Update min and max for x' and y'
        if x_prime < min_x_prime:
            min_x_prime = x_prime
        if x_prime > max_x_prime:
            max_x_prime = x_prime
        if y_prime < min_y_prime:
            min_y_prime = y_prime
        if y_prime > max_y_prime:
            max_y_prime = y_prime
    
    # Calculate width and height of the rectangle
    width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
    height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    
    # Print the result with high precision
    print(f"{perimeter:.12f}")

main()
```

This code reads the input, transforms the coordinates to align with the slope \( M \), calculates the bounding rectangle, and outputs the perimeter with high precision.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of distributing tiles to completely tile rooms in two houses, the core concept was recognizing that only perfect square numbers of tiles can be evenly split to tile two rooms of the same size. This insight led to the realization that for each test case, the solution involves finding the largest integer `k` such that `k*k <= N`, where `N` is the number of boxes.

    Initially, the solution failed due to incorrect input handling and function execution. The input was read inside a function that was never called, resulting in no output. The fix involved moving the input reading outside the function and ensuring the function was executed by placing it within a `main` function, which was then called in the standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This approach ensures the script runs correctly when executed directly.

    The use of `math.isqrt(N)` was a key improvement, providing an efficient and precise way to compute the integer square root, which is crucial for determining the number of rooms that can be completely tiled. This experience reinforced the importance of proper input/output handling in competitive programming and the utility of mathematical functions for efficient computation.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
      \[
      S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
      \]
      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

    ### Strategy:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_nth_term(N):
        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_nth_term(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a given set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to a given number \( M \). The task is to compute this perimeter with high precision.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope \( M \):**
   - A line with slope \( M \) can be represented as \( y = Mx + c \).
   - For a rectangle with one side having slope \( M \), the opposite side will have the same slope, and the other two sides will have slope \(-1/M\) (perpendicular).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System:**
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope \( M \). This can be done using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: \( x' = x + My \)
     - New y-coordinate: \( y' = y - Mx \)

3. **Finding the Bounding Box:**
   - After transforming the points, find the minimum and maximum values of the new coordinates \( x' \) and \( y' \).
   - These will give the dimensions of the rectangle in the transformed space.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   - The width of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum \( x' \) values.
   - The height of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum \( y' \) values.
   - The perimeter is then \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum of transformed coordinates.
3. For each point:
   - Compute the transformed coordinates \( x' \) and \( y' \).
   - Update the minimum and maximum values for \( x' \) and \( y' \).
4. Calculate the width and height of the rectangle in the transformed space.
5. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

## Python Code

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read

        x = float(data[index])
        y = float(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Transform the coordinates
        x_prime = x + M * y
        y_prime = y - M * x
        
        # Update min and max for x' and y'
        if x_prime < min_x_prime:
            min_x_prime = x_prime
        if x_prime > max_x_prime:
            max_x_prime = x_prime
        if y_prime < min_y_prime:
            min_y_prime = y_prime
        if y_prime > max_y_prime:
            max_y_prime = y_prime
    
    # Calculate width and height in the transformed space
    width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
    height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    # Calculate the perimeter

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the transformation of coordinates and the calculation of the rectangle's perimeter are not correctly aligned with the problem's requirements. Let's break down the problem and solution to identify the mistake:

1. **Understanding the Transformation:**
   - The transformation used in the code was intended to align the coordinate system with the slope \( M \). However, the transformation equations used were incorrect for this purpose.

2. **Correct Transformation:**
   - To align the rectangle with a slope \( M \), we need to consider the line equation \( y = Mx + c \) and its perpendicular line \( y = -\frac{1}{M}x + c' \).
   - The transformation should be such that it rotates the coordinate system to align with these lines.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - Use a rotation matrix to transform the points. The angle of rotation \(\theta\) can be derived from the slope \( M \) using \(\tan(\theta) = M\).
   - The rotation matrix for an angle \(\theta\) is:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\
     \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Calculate \(\theta\) using \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).

4. **Revised Steps:**
   - Compute the angle \(\theta\) from the slope \( M \).
   - Rotate each point using the rotation matrix.
   - Find the minimum and maximum of the rotated coordinates.
   - Calculate the width and height of the bounding rectangle in the rotated space.
   - Compute the perimeter.

## Revised Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Compute \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).
3. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum of rotated coordinates.
4. For each point:
   - Rotate the point using the rotation matrix.
   - Update the minimum and maximum values for the rotated coordinates.
5. Calculate the width and height of the rectangle in the rotated space.
6. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
7. Print the perimeter with high precision.

## Revised Python Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    import math
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = float(data[1])
    
    # Calculate the angle theta
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    min_x_rot = float('inf')
    max_x_rot = float('-inf')
    min_y_rot = float('inf')
    max_y_rot = float('-inf')
    
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = float(data[index])
        y = float(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Rotate the coordinates
        x_rot = x * cos_theta - y * sin_theta
        y_rot = x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
        
        # Update min and max for rotated coordinates
        if x_rot < min_x_rot:
            min_x_rot = x_rot
        if x_rot > max_x_rot:
            max_x_rot = x_rot
        if y_rot < min_y_rot:
            min_y_rot = y_rot
        if y_rot > max_y_rot:
            max_y_rot = y_rot
    
    # Calculate width and height in the rotated space
    width = max_x_rot - min_x_rot
    height = max_y_rot - min_y_rot
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    
    # Print the result with high precision

This revised code correctly rotates the points to align with the slope \( M \) and calculates the perimeter of the bounding rectangle.

We need to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a given set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to a given number \( M \). The task is to compute this perimeter with high precision.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope \( M \):**
   - A line with slope \( M \) can be represented as \( y = Mx + c \).
   - For a rectangle with one side having slope \( M \), the opposite side will have the same slope, and the other two sides will have slope \(-1/M\) (perpendicular).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System:**
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope \( M \). This can be done using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: \( x' = x + My \)
     - New y-coordinate: \( y' = y - Mx \)

3. **Finding the Bounding Box:**
   - After transforming the points, find the minimum and maximum values of the new coordinates \( x' \) and \( y' \).
   - These will give the dimensions of the rectangle in the transformed space.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   - The width of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum \( x' \) values.
   - The height of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum \( y' \) values.
   - The perimeter is then \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum of transformed coordinates.
3. For each point:
   - Compute the transformed coordinates \( x' \) and \( y' \).
   - Update the minimum and maximum values for \( x' \) and \( y' \).
4. Calculate the width and height of the rectangle in the transformed space.
5. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the transformation of coordinates and the calculation of the rectangle's perimeter are not correctly aligned with the problem's requirements. Let's break down the problem and solution to identify the mistake:

1. **Understanding the Transformation:**
   - The transformation used in the code was intended to align the coordinate system with the slope \( M \). However, the transformation equations used were incorrect for this purpose.

2. **Correct Transformation:**
   - To align the rectangle with a slope \( M \), we need to consider the line equation \( y = Mx + c \) and its perpendicular line \( y = -\frac{1}{M}x + c' \).
   - The transformation should be such that it rotates the coordinate system to align with these lines.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - Use a rotation matrix to transform the points. The angle of rotation \(\theta\) can be derived from the slope \( M \) using \(\tan(\theta) = M\).
   - The rotation matrix for an angle \(\theta\) is:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\
     \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Calculate \(\theta\) using \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).

4. **Revised Steps:**
   - Compute the angle \(\theta\) from the slope \( M \).
   - Rotate each point using the rotation matrix.
   - Find the minimum and maximum of the rotated coordinates.
   - Calculate the width and height of the bounding rectangle in the rotated space.
   - Compute the perimeter.

## Revised Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Compute \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).
3. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum of rotated coordinates.
4. For each point:
   - Rotate the point using the rotation matrix.
   - Update the minimum and maximum values for the rotated coordinates.
5. Calculate the width and height of the rectangle in the rotated space.
6. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
7. Print the perimeter with high precision.

        x_rot = x * cos_theta - y * sin_theta
        y_rot = x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
        
        # Update min and max for rotated coordinates
        if x_rot < min_x_rot:
            min_x_rot = x_rot
        if x_rot > max_x_rot:
            max_x_rot = x_rot
        if y_rot < min_y_rot:
            min_y_rot = y_rot
        if y_rot > max_y_rot:
            max_y_rot = y_rot
    
    # Calculate width and height in the rotated space
    width = max_x_rot - min_x_rot
    height = max_y_rot - min_y_rot
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    
    # Print the result with high precision
    print(f"{perimeter:.12f}")

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
      \[
      S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
      \]
      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

    ### Strategy:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_nth_term(N):
        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_nth_term(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of distributing tiles to completely tile rooms in two houses, the core concept was recognizing that only perfect square numbers of tiles can be evenly split to tile two rooms of the same size. This insight led to the realization that for each test case, the solution involves finding the largest integer `k` such that `k*k <= N`, where `N` is the number of boxes.

    Initially, the solution failed due to incorrect input handling and function execution. The input was read inside a function that was never called, resulting in no output. The fix involved moving the input reading outside the function and ensuring the function was executed by placing it within a `main` function, which was then called in the standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This approach ensures the script runs correctly when executed directly.

    The use of `math.isqrt(N)` was a key improvement, providing an efficient and precise way to compute the integer square root, which is crucial for determining the number of rooms that can be completely tiled. This experience reinforced the importance of proper input/output handling in competitive programming and the utility of mathematical functions for efficient computation.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a given set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to a given number \( M \). The task is to compute this perimeter with high precision.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope \( M \):**
   - A line with slope \( M \) can be represented as \( y = Mx + c \).
   - For a rectangle with one side having slope \( M \), the opposite side will have the same slope, and the other two sides will have slope \(-1/M\) (perpendicular).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System:**
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope \( M \). This can be done using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: \( x' = x + My \)
     - New y-coordinate: \( y' = y - Mx \)

3. **Finding the Bounding Box:**
   - After transforming the points, find the minimum and maximum values of the new coordinates \( x' \) and \( y' \).
   - These will give the dimensions of the rectangle in the transformed space.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   - The width of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum \( x' \) values.
   - The height of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum \( y' \) values.
   - The perimeter is then \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum of transformed coordinates.
3. For each point:
   - Compute the transformed coordinates \( x' \) and \( y' \).
   - Update the minimum and maximum values for \( x' \) and \( y' \).
4. Calculate the width and height of the rectangle in the transformed space.
5. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

2. **Correct Transformation:**
   - To align the rectangle with a slope \( M \), we need to consider the line equation \( y = Mx + c \) and its perpendicular line \( y = -\frac{1}{M}x + c' \).
   - The transformation should be such that it rotates the coordinate system to align with these lines.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - Use a rotation matrix to transform the points. The angle of rotation \(\theta\) can be derived from the slope \( M \) using \(\tan(\theta) = M\).
   - The rotation matrix for an angle \(\theta\) is:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\
     \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Calculate \(\theta\) using \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).

4. **Revised Steps:**
   - Compute the angle \(\theta\) from the slope \( M \).
   - Rotate each point using the rotation matrix.
   - Find the minimum and maximum of the rotated coordinates.
   - Calculate the width and height of the bounding rectangle in the rotated space.
   - Compute the perimeter.

## Revised Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Compute \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).
3. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum of rotated coordinates.
4. For each point:
   - Rotate the point using the rotation matrix.
   - Update the minimum and maximum values for the rotated coordinates.
5. Calculate the width and height of the rectangle in the rotated space.
6. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
7. Print the perimeter with high precision.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a set of points on a 2D plane, with one side of the rectangle having a specified slope \( M \). The core concept involved transforming the coordinate system to align with the given slope, which required understanding and applying geometric transformations, specifically rotations.

Initially, the approach used a simple transformation that did not correctly align the rectangle with the slope \( M \). The correct approach involved using a rotation matrix derived from the angle \(\theta\), where \(\theta = \arctan(M)\). This rotation matrix allowed us to transform the points such that the rectangle's sides were aligned with the specified slope.

The key learning was the importance of correctly applying geometric transformations to solve problems involving specific orientations. The use of trigonometric functions to derive the rotation matrix was crucial in aligning the coordinate system with the desired slope. This experience reinforced the need to carefully consider the mathematical foundations when dealing with geometric problems.

The final solution involved:
- Calculating the angle \(\theta\) using \(\arctan(M)\).
- Applying a rotation matrix to transform the points.
- Finding the bounding box in the transformed space.
- Calculating the perimeter of the rectangle using the dimensions of this bounding box.

This approach successfully solved the problem, demonstrating the effectiveness of using geometric transformations to handle orientation constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a given set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to a given number \( M \). The task is to compute this perimeter with high precision.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope \( M \):**
   - A line with slope \( M \) can be represented as \( y = Mx + c \).
   - For a rectangle with one side having slope \( M \), the opposite side will have the same slope, and the other two sides will have slope \(-1/M\) (perpendicular).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System:**
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope \( M \). This can be done using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: \( x' = x + My \)
     - New y-coordinate: \( y' = y - Mx \)

3. **Finding the Bounding Box:**
   - After transforming the points, find the minimum and maximum values of the new coordinates \( x' \) and \( y' \).
   - These will give the dimensions of the rectangle in the transformed space.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   - The width of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum \( x' \) values.
   - The height of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum \( y' \) values.
   - The perimeter is then \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum of transformed coordinates.
3. For each point:
   - Compute the transformed coordinates \( x' \) and \( y' \).
   - Update the minimum and maximum values for \( x' \) and \( y' \).
4. Calculate the width and height of the rectangle in the transformed space.
5. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the transformation of coordinates and the calculation of the rectangle's perimeter are not correctly aligned with the problem's requirements. Let's break down the problem and solution to identify the mistake:

1. **Understanding the Transformation:**
   - The transformation used in the code was intended to align the coordinate system with the slope \( M \). However, the transformation equations used were incorrect for this purpose.

2. **Correct Transformation:**
   - To align the rectangle with a slope \( M \), we need to consider the line equation \( y = Mx + c \) and its perpendicular line \( y = -\frac{1}{M}x + c' \).
   - The transformation should be such that it rotates the coordinate system to align with these lines.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - Use a rotation matrix to transform the points. The angle of rotation \(\theta\) can be derived from the slope \( M \) using \(\tan(\theta) = M\).
   - The rotation matrix for an angle \(\theta\) is:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\
     \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Calculate \(\theta\) using \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).

4. **Revised Steps:**
   - Compute the angle \(\theta\) from the slope \( M \).
   - Rotate each point using the rotation matrix.
   - Find the minimum and maximum of the rotated coordinates.
   - Calculate the width and height of the bounding rectangle in the rotated space.
   - Compute the perimeter.

## Revised Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Compute \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).
3. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum of rotated coordinates.
4. For each point:
   - Rotate the point using the rotation matrix.
   - Update the minimum and maximum values for the rotated coordinates.
5. Calculate the width and height of the rectangle in the rotated space.
6. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
7. Print the perimeter with high precision.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a set of points, with one side having a specified slope \( M \). The key challenge was to correctly transform the coordinate system to align the rectangle with the given slope.

### Insights and Key Learnings:

1. **Coordinate Transformation:**
   - The official solution uses a transformation based on trigonometric identities to align the rectangle with the slope \( M \). This involves calculating the cosine and sine of the angle derived from the slope \( M \) using the formula:
     \[
     \text{cosx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + M^2}}, \quad \text{sinx} = \frac{M}{\sqrt{1 + M^2}}
     \]
   - This transformation effectively rotates the coordinate system so that the rectangle's sides are aligned with the desired slope.

2. **Bounding Box Calculation:**
   - After transforming the points, the solution calculates the bounding box by finding the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates. This gives the dimensions of the rectangle in the transformed space.

3. **Perimeter Calculation:**
   - The perimeter is then calculated as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \), where width and height are the differences between the maximum and minimum transformed coordinates.

### Reflection on My Approach:

- My initial approach attempted to use a rotation matrix based on the angle \(\theta = \arctan(M)\). While this is mathematically sound, the implementation was incorrect due to errors in the transformation equations.
- The official solution simplifies the transformation by directly using trigonometric identities, which is both efficient and easy to implement.
- The key takeaway is the importance of correctly transforming the coordinate system to align with the desired geometric properties, and the use of trigonometric identities can simplify this process.

The main function is `main`.
INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes an integer N and a float M, followed by N pairs of floating-point numbers representing coordinates. It calculates the angle theta using the arctangent of M and computes the cosine and sine of this angle. The function then rotates each coordinate pair by this angle and determines the minimum and maximum x and y values in the rotated coordinate space. It calculates the width and height of the bounding box in this rotated space and computes the perimeter of this box. Finally, it prints the perimeter with a precision of 12 decimal places.

[Problem]
    Today, Chef has a fencing job at hand and has to fence up a surface covering N$N$ points. 
    To minimize his work, he started looking for an algorithm that had him fence the least amount of length. 
    He came up with the Convex Hull algorithm, but soon realized it gave him some random shape to fence. However, Chef likes rectangles and has a favourite number M$M$. 
    Help him find the minimum perimeter he has to fence if he wants to fence a rectangle, with slope of one of the sides as M$M$, to cover all the points.

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line contains two integers N$N$ and M$M$, the number of points and the Chef's favourite Number.
    - The next n lines contain two space separated integers X$X$ and Y$Y$, the coordinates of the point.

    -----Output:-----
    Print a single decimal number, denoting the perimeter of the rectangle. Answer will considered correct if it has absolute error less than 10âˆ’6$10^{-6}$.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 2â‰¤Nâ‰¤1000000$2 \leq N \leq 1000000$
    - âˆ’1000â‰¤Mâ‰¤1000$-1000 \leq M \leq 1000$
    - âˆ’1000000â‰¤Xâ‰¤1000000$-1000000 \leq X \leq 1000000$
    - âˆ’1000000â‰¤Yâ‰¤1000000$-1000000 \leq Y \leq 1000000$

    -----Sample Input:-----
