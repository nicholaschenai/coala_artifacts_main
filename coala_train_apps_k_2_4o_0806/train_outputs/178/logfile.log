INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) within this list. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements. The task is to determine the length of the longest subsequence where each element is greater than the previous one.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We initialize each element of `dp` to 1 because the minimum length of an increasing subsequence that includes any single element is 1 (the element itself).

For each element in the list, we check all previous elements to see if they are smaller. If they are, we update the `dp` value for the current element to be the maximum of its current value and the `dp` value of the previous element plus one. This way, we build up the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each element.

Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the entire list will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function lengthOfLIS(nums):
    if nums is empty:
        return 0
    
    n = length of nums
    dp = array of size n initialized to 1
    
    for i from 1 to n-1:
        for j from 0 to i-1:
            if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    return max value in dp
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # If the input list is empty, the length of LIS is 0
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        # Initialize the dp array where each element is 1
        # because the smallest LIS ending at each element is the element itself
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [1] * n
        
        # Iterate over each element in the list
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Check all previous elements to find the longest increasing subsequence
            for j in range(i):
                # If the current element is greater than a previous element
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    # Update the dp value for the current element
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
        # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in dp
        return max(dp)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which meets the problem's requirement.

    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a sequence of books numbered from 1 to N. The key insight was recognizing that the problem could be efficiently solved using the concept of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). The books that are already in the correct order form an increasing subsequence, and the minimum number of moves needed is the total number of books minus the length of this LIS.

    The solution involved implementing a function to find the length of the LIS using a binary search approach, which is efficient and works in O(N log N) time complexity. This is crucial given the constraint that N can be as large as 200,000. The binary search helps in maintaining a list that represents the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences of various lengths.

    The main challenge was ensuring the LIS calculation was efficient, and the binary search approach was key to achieving this. The solution was tested and passed all provided test cases, confirming its correctness and efficiency. This approach is a useful pattern for similar problems involving sorting or rearranging sequences with minimal operations.

INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest subsequence where each number is greater than the previous one. The subsequence does not need to be contiguous. We aim to solve this problem with a time complexity of O(n^2).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. Initially, each element in `d` is set to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element, we check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the `d` array.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

       if nums is empty:

INFO - [Task id] 178 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest subsequence where each number is greater than the previous one. The subsequence does not need to be contiguous. We aim to solve this problem with a time complexity of O(n^2).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. Initially, each element in `d` is set to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element, we check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the `d` array.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function lengthOfLIS(nums):
       if nums is empty:
           return 0

       d = array of size n initialized to 1

INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key was to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.

The solution was straightforward, and there were no unexpected errors. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding dynamic programming and how to apply it to problems involving subsequences. The final solution achieved the desired O(n^2) time complexity, which is efficient for this type of problem. Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        n = len(nums)
        d = [1] * n
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
        return max(d)
```

This experience highlighted the effectiveness of dynamic programming in solving subsequence problems and the importance of iterating over elements in a nested manner to build up solutions incrementally.

INFO - [Task id] 178 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest subsequence where each number is greater than the previous one. The subsequence does not need to be contiguous. We aim to solve this problem with a time complexity of O(n^2).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. Initially, each element in `d` is set to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element, we check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the `d` array.

INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] The official solution provides an insightful approach to solving the problem with a time complexity of O(n log n), which is more efficient than the O(n^2) solution I initially implemented. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Use of a Dynamic List (`res`):** 
   - The solution maintains a list `res` that represents the smallest possible last elements of increasing subsequences of various lengths. This list is not the actual subsequence but helps in determining the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

2. **Binary Search for Efficiency:**
   - The solution uses a binary search to find the correct position to replace an element in `res`. This ensures that the list `res` remains sorted and allows for efficient updates. The binary search is implemented in the helper function `binarySearch`.

3. **Building the `res` List:**
   - For each element in the input list `nums`, if the element is greater than the last element in `res`, it is appended to `res`. This extends the longest increasing subsequence.
   - If the element is not greater, the binary search is used to find the position in `res` where this element should replace an existing element. This replacement ensures that `res` contains the smallest possible values, allowing for potential longer subsequences in the future.

4. **Result:**
   - The length of the list `res` at the end of the iteration is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

This approach is efficient and elegant, leveraging the properties of binary search to maintain a sorted list that helps in determining the length of the longest increasing subsequence. It is a great example of how understanding the problem deeply can lead to a more optimal solution.
