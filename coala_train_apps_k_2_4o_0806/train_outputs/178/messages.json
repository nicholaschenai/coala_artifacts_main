        "content": "Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) within this list. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements. The task is to determine the length of the longest subsequence where each element is greater than the previous one.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We initialize each element of `dp` to 1 because the minimum length of an increasing subsequence that includes any single element is 1 (the element itself).\n\nFor each element in the list, we check all previous elements to see if they are smaller. If they are, we update the `dp` value for the current element to be the maximum of its current value and the `dp` value of the previous element plus one. This way, we build up the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each element.\n\nFinally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the entire list will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction lengthOfLIS(nums):\n    if nums is empty:\n        return 0\n    \n    n = length of nums\n    dp = array of size n initialized to 1\n    \n    for i from 1 to n-1:\n        for j from 0 to i-1:\n            if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n    \n    return max value in dp\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # If the input list is empty, the length of LIS is 0\n        if not nums:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Initialize the dp array where each element is 1\n        # because the smallest LIS ending at each element is the element itself\n        n = len(nums)\n        dp = [1] * n\n        \n        # Iterate over each element in the list\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            # Check all previous elements to find the longest increasing subsequence\n            for j in range(i):\n                # If the current element is greater than a previous element\n                if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                    # Update the dp value for the current element\n                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n        \n        # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in dp\n        return max(dp)\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which meets the problem's requirement."

example\n\n        $$\\begin{array}{ll}\n        a &= \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\} \\\\\n        d &= \\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\\}\n        \\end{array}$$\n\n        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\\}$ or $\\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\\{0, 1\\}$ having length 2.\n\n    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.\n    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.\n\n    So let the current index be $i$.\n    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \\dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.\n    Then there are two options:\n\n    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.\n\n    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.\n        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.\n\n        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.\n        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.\n  \n        $$d[i] = \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(1, \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)\\right)$$\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {\n                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;\n                    p[i] = j;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if (d[i] > ans) {\n                ans = d[i];\n                pos = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        vector<int> subseq;\n        while (pos != -1) {\n            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);\n            pos = p[pos];\n        }\n        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());\n        return subseq;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a sequence of books numbered from 1 to N. The key insight was recognizing that the problem could be efficiently solved using the concept of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). The books that are already in the correct order form an increasing subsequence, and the minimum number of moves needed is the total number of books minus the length of this LIS.\n\n    The solution involved implementing a function to find the length of the LIS using a binary search approach, which is efficient and works in O(N log N) time complexity. This is crucial given the constraint that N can be as large as 200,000. The binary search helps in maintaining a list that represents the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences of various lengths.\n\n    The main challenge was ensuring the LIS calculation was efficient, and the binary search approach was key to achieving this. The solution was tested and passed all provided test cases, confirming its correctness and efficiency. This approach is a useful pattern for similar problems involving sorting or rearranging sequences with minimal operations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
