    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a list where each element represents the price of a stock on a particular day. We need to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying and then selling the stock. We cannot hold more than one stock at a time, meaning we must sell the stock before buying again.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can break it down into two main parts:\n   - Calculate the maximum profit achievable with one transaction up to each day.\n   - Calculate the maximum profit achievable with two transactions by considering the profit from the first transaction and the potential profit from a second transaction starting from the next day.\n\n   We can use dynamic programming to keep track of these profits:\n   - Use an array `left_profits` where `left_profits[i]` stores the maximum profit achievable from day 0 to day i with one transaction.\n   - Use another array `right_profits` where `right_profits[i]` stores the maximum profit achievable from day i to the last day with one transaction.\n   - The maximum profit with two transactions is the maximum value of `left_profits[i] + right_profits[i]` for all i.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize left_profits and right_profits arrays with zeros\n   Initialize min_price to the first price in the list\n   Initialize max_price to the last price in the list\n\n   For each day i from 1 to n-1:\n       Update min_price to be the minimum of min_price and prices[i]\n       Update left_profits[i] to be the maximum of left_profits[i-1] and prices[i] - min_price\n\n   For each day i from n-2 to 0:\n       Update max_price to be the maximum of max_price and prices[i]\n       Update right_profits[i] to be the maximum of right_profits[i+1] and max_price - prices[i]\n\n   Initialize max_profit to 0\n   For each day i from 0 to n-1:\n       Update max_profit to be the maximum of max_profit and left_profits[i] + right_profits[i]\n\n   Return max_profit\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n        if not prices:\n            return 0\n        \n        n = len(prices)\n        \n        # Initialize arrays to store the maximum profit up to each day\n        left_profits = [0] * n\n        right_profits = [0] * n\n        \n        # Calculate left_profits\n        min_price = prices[0]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])\n            left_profits[i] = max(left_profits[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)\n        \n        # Calculate right_profits\n        max_price = prices[-1]\n        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])\n            right_profits[i] = max(right_profits[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum profit with at most two transactions\n        max_profit = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            max_profit = max(max_profit, left_profits[i] + right_profits[i])\n        \n        return max_profit\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit by considering the best possible single transaction up to each day and the best possible single transaction from each day to the end, then combines these to find the best two-transaction strategy.",
