We can perform at most one operation where we remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to rearrange the string by moving one character to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order.\n2. **Approach**:\n   - For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.\n   - For each possible new string, check if it is the smallest lexicographically.\n   - Keep track of the smallest string found.\n3. **Optimization Insight**: Since we are allowed only one move, the optimal strategy is to find the smallest character that can be moved to the front or to a position where it results in a smaller string.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the number of test cases `T`.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Read the integer `N` and the string `S`.\n   - Initialize `min_string` as the original string `S`.\n   - For each character in `S`:\n     - Remove the character and try inserting it at every other position.\n     - Form the new string and compare it with `min_string`.\n     - If the new string is smaller, update `min_string`.\n   - After checking all possibilities, store the `min_string` as the result for this test case.\n3. Print the results for all test cases.\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        N, S = test_cases[i]\n        min_string = S\n        \n        # Try removing each character and inserting it at every other position\n        for j in range(N):\n            for k in range(N):\n                if j != k:\n                    # Create a new string by removing S[j] and inserting it at position k\n                    new_string = S[:j] + S[j+1:]\n                    new_string = new_string[:k] + S[j] + new_string[k:]\n                    \n                    # Update min_string if the new string is smaller\n                    if new_string < min_string:\n                        min_string = new_string\n        \n        results.append(min_string)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    S = data[index + 1]\n    test_cases.append((N, S))\n    index += 2\n\n# Get results\nresults = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` processes each test case independently.\n- For each character in the string, it attempts to remove and reinsert it at every other position.\n- It keeps track of the smallest string found during these operations.\n- Finally, it outputs the smallest string for each test case."

If they do, we remove these three characters from the stack.\n        4. **Repeat Until Done**: Continue this process until we have processed all characters in the string.\n        5. **Resulting String**: The characters remaining in the stack form the resulting string after all \"abc\" substrings have been removed.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function remove_abc(string):\n            stack = empty list\n            for each character in string:\n                add character to stack\n                if last three characters in stack form \"abc\":\n                    remove last three characters from stack\n            return join characters in stack to form the resulting string\n\n        function process_test_cases(test_cases):\n            results = empty list\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                result = remove_abc(test_case)\n                add result to results\n            return results\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def remove_abc(s):\n            stack = []\n            for char in s:\n                stack.append(char)\n                # Check if the last three characters form \"abc\"\n                if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n                    # Remove the last three characters\n                    stack.pop()\n                    stack.pop()\n                    stack.pop()\n            # Join the stack to form the resulting string\n            return ''.join(stack)\n\n        def process_test_cases(test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                result = remove_abc(test_case)\n                results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().strip().split()\n\n        # First line is the number of test cases\n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = data[1:T+1]\n\n        # Process each test case\n        results = process_test_cases(test_cases)\n\n        # Output results\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code\n\n        - **remove_abc Function**: This function takes a string and uses a stack to remove all occurrences of the substring \"abc\".

This brute-force approach was feasible given the constraints (maximum string length of 50 and up to 50 test cases).\n\n### Code Snippet\nThe function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` was central to the solution. It iterated over all possible character moves and checked if the resulting string was smaller than the current smallest found:\n\n```python\ndef find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):\n    smallest_string = S\n    N = len(S)\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if i != j:\n                new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]\n                new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]\n                if new_string < smallest_string:\n                    smallest_string = new_string\n    return smallest_string\n```\n\n### Outcome\nThe solution was effective and passed all test cases. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and lexicographical order, as well as the utility of brute-force approaches when constraints are manageable."

My initial approach was similar to the official solution, but the official solution is more concise and efficient in its implementation.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Iterative Character Removal and Reinsertion**: The official solution iterates over each character in the string, removes it, and then attempts to insert it at every possible position in the remaining string. This ensures that all possible single-move permutations are considered.\n\n2. **Use of `min` Function**: The official solution uses the `min` function to keep track of the smallest string found so far. This is a clean and efficient way to compare strings lexicographically.\n\n3. **Conciseness**: The official solution is concise, using nested loops effectively to explore all permutations with a single character move. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly manipulating string slices.\n\n### Reflection:\n\n- The official solution is insightful in its simplicity and efficiency. It demonstrates the power of direct string manipulation and the use of built-in functions like `min` to maintain clarity and performance.\n- My approach was on the right track, but the official solution's use of string slicing and the `min` function is a more elegant way to achieve the same result.\n- This problem reinforces the importance of considering all permutations when dealing with problems that involve rearranging elements to achieve a desired order. It also highlights the utility of Python's string manipulation capabilities in solving such problems efficiently."

It processes each test case by finding the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by moving one character in the string S to a different position. The results for each test case are collected in a list. Finally, the function returns the list of results.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to rearrange characters in a string to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order with minimal operations. This can be applied in text processing, data sorting, and optimization problems where constraints limit the number of operations. Understanding how to manipulate strings efficiently is crucial in competitive programming and algorithm design, especially when dealing with constraints on operations and input size. The solution demonstrates a brute-force approach to explore all possible single-character moves, which is feasible given the problem's constraints, and can be adapted to similar problems with slight variations in constraints or objectives."
