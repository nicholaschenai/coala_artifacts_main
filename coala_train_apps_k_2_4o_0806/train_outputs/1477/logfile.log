INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters. We can perform at most one operation where we remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to rearrange the string by moving one character to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order.
2. **Approach**:
   - For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.
   - For each possible new string, check if it is the smallest lexicographically.
   - Keep track of the smallest string found.
3. **Optimization Insight**: Since we are allowed only one move, the optimal strategy is to find the smallest character that can be moved to the front or to a position where it results in a smaller string.

## Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer `N` and the string `S`.
   - Initialize `min_string` as the original string `S`.
   - For each character in `S`:
     - Remove the character and try inserting it at every other position.
     - Form the new string and compare it with `min_string`.
     - If the new string is smaller, update `min_string`.
   - After checking all possibilities, store the `min_string` as the result for this test case.
3. Print the results for all test cases.

## Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    
    for i in range(T):
        N, S = test_cases[i]
        min_string = S
        
        # Try removing each character and inserting it at every other position
        for j in range(N):
            for k in range(N):
                if j != k:
                    # Create a new string by removing S[j] and inserting it at position k
                    new_string = S[:j] + S[j+1:]
                    new_string = new_string[:k] + S[j] + new_string[k:]
                    
                    # Update min_string if the new string is smaller
                    if new_string < min_string:
                        min_string = new_string
        
        results.append(min_string)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []

for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    S = data[index + 1]
    test_cases.append((N, S))
    index += 2

# Get results
results = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` processes each test case independently.
- For each character in the string, it attempts to remove and reinsert it at every other position.
- It keeps track of the smallest string found during these operations.
- Finally, it outputs the smallest string for each test case.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a string consisting of lowercase English alphabets. The task is to iteratively remove all occurrences of the substring "abc" from the string until no such substring remains. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to efficiently remove the "abc" substrings:

        1. **Iterate through the String**: For each character in the string, we will process it one by one.
        2. **Use a Stack**: We will use a stack to keep track of the characters that are not part of an "abc" substring.
        3. **Check for "abc"**: As we add each character to the stack, we check if the last three characters in the stack form the substring "abc". If they do, we remove these three characters from the stack.
        4. **Repeat Until Done**: Continue this process until we have processed all characters in the string.
        5. **Resulting String**: The characters remaining in the stack form the resulting string after all "abc" substrings have been removed.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function remove_abc(string):
            stack = empty list
            for each character in string:
                add character to stack
                if last three characters in stack form "abc":
                    remove last three characters from stack
            return join characters in stack to form the resulting string

        function process_test_cases(test_cases):
            results = empty list
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                result = remove_abc(test_case)
                add result to results
            return results
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def remove_abc(s):
            stack = []
            for char in s:
                stack.append(char)
                # Check if the last three characters form "abc"
                if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:
                    # Remove the last three characters
                    stack.pop()
                    stack.pop()
                    stack.pop()
            # Join the stack to form the resulting string
            return ''.join(stack)

        def process_test_cases(test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                result = remove_abc(test_case)
                results.append(result)
            return results

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().strip().split()

        # First line is the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = data[1:T+1]

        # Process each test case
        results = process_test_cases(test_cases)

        # Output results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **remove_abc Function**: This function takes a string and uses a stack to remove all occurrences of the substring "abc". It iterates through each character, adding it to the stack, and checks if the last three characters in the stack form "abc". If they do, it removes them.
        - **process_test_cases Function**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `remove_abc` for each test case and collecting the results.
        - **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

    [Task]:
        Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
        He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
        21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
        Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
        12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
        Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
        12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
        Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

        -----Input:-----
        The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

        -----Output:-----
        A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are not in order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can leverage the concept of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). The idea is that the books that are already in the correct order form an increasing subsequence. The minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of this longest increasing subsequence. This is because the books that are not part of the LIS need to be moved to achieve the sorted order.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Function findLISLength(arr):
               Initialize an empty list 'lis'
               For each book in arr:
                   If lis is empty or book is greater than the last element in lis:
                       Append book to lis
                   Else:
                       Find the position in lis where book should be placed to maintain sorted order
                       Replace the element at that position with book
               Return the length of lis

           Function minMovesToSortBooks(N, books):
               lis_length = findLISLength(books)
               Return N - lis_length
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        def findLISLength(arr):
            # This function finds the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
            # using a binary search approach for efficiency.
            lis = []
            for book in arr:
                # If lis is empty or the current book is greater than the last element in lis
                if not lis or book > lis[-1]:
                    lis.append(book)
                else:
                    # Find the position where the current book should be placed
                    # to maintain the sorted order of lis
                    left, right = 0, len(lis) - 1
                    while left < right:
                        mid = (left + right) // 2
                        if lis[mid] < book:
                            left = mid + 1
                        else:
                            right = mid
                    # Replace the element at the found position with the current book
                    lis[left] = book
            # Return the length of the LIS
            return len(lis)

        def minMovesToSortBooks(N, books):
            # Calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence
            lis_length = findLISLength(books)
            # The minimum number of moves is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS
            return N - lis_length

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        N = int(data[0])
        books = list(map(int, data[1:]))

        # Output the result
        print(minMovesToSortBooks(N, books))
        ```

        This solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of moves required to sort the books by finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence and subtracting it from the total number of books.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a string consisting of uppercase English letters. We are allowed to perform at most one operation where we can remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our task is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

### Conceptual Solution

To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify the smallest character**: We should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible.
2. **Positioning**: If the smallest character is not already at the beginning, we should move it to the start. If it is already at the start, we should look for the next smallest character that can be moved to improve the order.
3. **Iterate through the string**: For each character, check if moving it to the start or another position can result in a smaller string.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
    smallest_string = S
    for i from 0 to length of S - 1:
        for j from 0 to length of S - 1:
            if i != j:
                # Create a new string by moving character at i to position j
                new_string = S with character at i removed and inserted at j
                if new_string is lexicographically smaller than smallest_string:
                    smallest_string = new_string
    return smallest_string

function process_test_cases(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, S = test_case
        result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)
        add result to results
    return results
```

## Instructions
Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing at most one operation of removing a character from any position in the string and inserting it back at any other position. The key concept here was to leverage the ability to reposition characters to achieve a smaller lexicographical order.

### Core Concepts and Patterns
- **Lexicographical Order**: Understanding how strings are compared based on character order was crucial. The task was essentially about rearranging characters to achieve the smallest possible order.
- **Character Repositioning**: The problem allowed for one character to be moved, which meant exploring all possible single-character moves to find the optimal configuration.

### Strategy
The strategy involved iterating over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. This brute-force approach was feasible given the constraints (maximum string length of 50 and up to 50 test cases).

### Code Snippet
The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` was central to the solution. It iterated over all possible character moves and checked if the resulting string was smaller than the current smallest found:

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
    smallest_string = S
    N = len(S)
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if i != j:
                new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]
                new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]
                if new_string < smallest_string:
                    smallest_string = new_string
    return smallest_string
```

### Outcome
The solution was effective and passed all test cases. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and lexicographical order, as well as the utility of brute-force approaches when constraints are manageable.

### Explanation of the Code

- **find_lexicographically_smallest_string Function**: This function iterates over all possible pairs of positions in the string, simulating the removal and reinsertion of a character. It checks if the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the current smallest string found.
- **process_test_cases Function**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` for each test case and collecting the results.
- **Main Execution**: The code reads input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for _1 in range(int(input())):
 n=int(input())
 s=input().strip()
 answer=s
 for i in range(len(s)):
  c=s[i]
  string=s[:i]+s[i+1:]
  for j in range(len(string)+1):
   answer=min(answer, string[:j]+c+string[j:])
 print(answer)

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] The problem of finding the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character is a classic example of exploring permutations with constraints. My initial approach was similar to the official solution, but the official solution is more concise and efficient in its implementation.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Iterative Character Removal and Reinsertion**: The official solution iterates over each character in the string, removes it, and then attempts to insert it at every possible position in the remaining string. This ensures that all possible single-move permutations are considered.

2. **Use of `min` Function**: The official solution uses the `min` function to keep track of the smallest string found so far. This is a clean and efficient way to compare strings lexicographically.

3. **Conciseness**: The official solution is concise, using nested loops effectively to explore all permutations with a single character move. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly manipulating string slices.

### Reflection:

- The official solution is insightful in its simplicity and efficiency. It demonstrates the power of direct string manipulation and the use of built-in functions like `min` to maintain clarity and performance.
- My approach was on the right track, but the official solution's use of string slicing and the `min` function is a more elegant way to achieve the same result.
- This problem reinforces the importance of considering all permutations when dealing with problems that involve rearranging elements to achieve a desired order. It also highlights the utility of Python's string manipulation capabilities in solving such problems efficiently.

[Problem]
    You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

    Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

    -----Input-----
    The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
    The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
    The second line contains the string S.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
    - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
    - S will consist of uppercase English letters.

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    2
    4
    DCBA
    7
    XYZZYZZ

    Output:
    ADCB
    XYYZZZZ

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
    Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ
