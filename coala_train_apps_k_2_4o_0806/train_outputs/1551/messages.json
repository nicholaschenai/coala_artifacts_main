Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ...

Using `S`, we form an infinite pyramid where the `N`-th row contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner. We are asked `Q` queries, each asking for the number of occurrences of `T` in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding the Pyramid**:\n           - The `N`-th row of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.\n           - For example, if `S = \"codechef\"`, the 12th row would be `\"codechefcode\"`.\n\n        2. **Finding Occurrences**:\n           - For each query, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row.\n           - This can be done by iterating over the `N`-th row and checking for matches with `T`.\n\n        3. **Efficient Construction**:\n           - Instead of constructing the entire row, we can simulate the cyclic nature of `S` using modulo operations to determine the character at each position.\n\n        4. **Handling Large `N`**:\n           - Since `N` can be very large (up to \\(10^9\\)), we need to avoid constructing the row explicitly. Instead, we simulate the row using indices and modulo operations.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n            results = []\n            len_S = length of S\n            len_T = length of T\n\n            for each query N in queries:\n                count = 0\n                for i from 0 to N - len_T:\n                    match = true\n                    for j from 0 to len_T - 1:\n                        if S[(i + j) % len_S] != T[j]:\n                            match = false\n                            break\n                    if match:\n                        count += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            return results\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n            results = []\n            len_S = len(S)\n            len_T = len(T)\n\n            for N in queries:\n                count = 0\n                # Check each possible starting position for T in the N-th row\n                for i in range(N - len_T + 1):\n                    match = True\n                    # Check if T matches starting at position i\n                    for j in range(len_T):\n                        if S[(i + j) % len_S] != T[j]:\n                            match = False\n                            break\n                    if match:\n                        count += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            return results\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            S = data[0]\n            T = data[1]\n            Q = int(data[2])\n            queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]\n    \n            results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **count_occurrences**: This function takes the string `S`, the string `T`, and a list of queries.

        "content": "In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of determining whether a quote is \"Real Fancy\" or \"regularly fancy\" based on the presence of the word \"not\" as a separate word. The key insight is to split the quote into words and check for the presence of \"not\".\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Word Splitting**: Both solutions use the `split()` method to break the quote into individual words. This is crucial because it ensures that \"not\" is checked as a separate word, not as a substring of another word.\n\n2. **Checking for \"not\"**: The solutions then check if \"not\" is present in the list of words. This is a straightforward and efficient way to determine the fanciness of the quote.\n\n3. **Loop Structure**: The official solution uses a `while` loop to iterate through the test cases, whereas my solution uses a `for` loop. Both are valid approaches, but the `for` loop is often more Pythonic and concise for iterating over a known range.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe problem was straightforward, and both solutions are efficient given the constraints. The use of `split()` and checking membership in a list are common techniques in string processing tasks. This exercise reinforces the importance of understanding how to manipulate strings and lists in Python, which is a fundamental skill in many programming problems."

        "content": "\n[description for function: classify_quotes]\nThe function processes a list of quotes and checks each one to determine if it contains the word \"not\" as a separate word. If a quote contains \"not\", it prints \"Real Fancy\"; otherwise, it prints \"regularly fancy\". The function iterates over each quote, splits it into individual words, and performs the check for the word \"not\". The output is printed directly for each quote based on the presence or absence of the word \"not\".\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to classify or filter text based on the presence of specific words. For instance, in natural language processing tasks, you might need to determine the sentiment or category of a text based on certain keywords. This problem specifically deals with identifying whether a quote contains the word 'not' as a standalone word, which is a common task in text analysis where context and word boundaries are important. This can be applied in developing chatbots, content moderation systems, or any application that requires understanding the context of a sentence based on key terms."
