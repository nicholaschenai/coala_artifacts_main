"I don't have any fancy quotes." - vijju123
Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
You are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 50$

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given quote is "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy". A quote is considered "Real Fancy" if it contains the word "not" as a standalone word. If "not" is not present as a standalone word, the quote is "regularly fancy". We will be given multiple quotes to evaluate.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each quote, we need to check if the word "not" appears as a standalone word.
2. A standalone word means it is surrounded by spaces or is at the beginning or end of the string.
3. We will split each quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words.
4. If "not" is found, the quote is "Real Fancy". Otherwise, it is "regularly fancy".

## Pseudocode

```
function classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for each quote in quotes:
        split the quote into words
        if "not" is in the list of words:
            print "Real Fancy"
        else:
            print "regularly fancy"

read T from input
initialize an empty list for quotes
for i from 1 to T:
    read a quote and append to quotes list

call classify_quotes with T and quotes
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate over each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is a standalone word in the list
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
# Initialize a list to store the quotes
quotes = []
# Read each quote
for _ in range(T):
    quote = input().strip()
    quotes.append(quote)

# Classify each quote
classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and each quote, then checks if "not" is a standalone word in each quote. It prints "Real Fancy" if "not" is found, otherwise "regularly fancy".

    [Task]:
        Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
        - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
        - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
        - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
        He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
        You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where i≤j$i \leq j$.
        For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
        c
        co
        cod
        code
        codec
        codeco

        -----Input:-----
        - The first line contains string S$S$ — consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - The second line contains string T$T$ — consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ — the number of queries.
        - Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a string `S` and a string `T`. Using `S`, we form an infinite pyramid where the `N`-th row contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner. We are asked `Q` queries, each asking for the number of occurrences of `T` in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Pyramid**:
           - The `N`-th row of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.
           - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

        2. **Finding Occurrences**:
           - For each query, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row.
           - This can be done by iterating over the `N`-th row and checking for matches with `T`.

        3. **Efficient Construction**:
           - Instead of constructing the entire row, we can simulate the cyclic nature of `S` using modulo operations to determine the character at each position.

        4. **Handling Large `N`**:
           - Since `N` can be very large (up to \(10^9\)), we need to avoid constructing the row explicitly. Instead, we simulate the row using indices and modulo operations.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
            results = []
            len_S = length of S
            len_T = length of T

            for each query N in queries:
                count = 0
                for i from 0 to N - len_T:
                    match = true
                    for j from 0 to len_T - 1:
                        if S[(i + j) % len_S] != T[j]:
                            match = false
                            break
                    if match:
                        count += 1
                results.append(count)
    
            return results
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
            results = []
            len_S = len(S)

            for N in queries:

                    # Check if T matches starting at position i
                    for j in range(len_T):

        ### Explanation

        - **count_occurrences**: This function takes the string `S`, the string `T`, and a list of queries. For each query, it calculates how many times `T` appears in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.
        - **main**: This function handles input and output. It reads the input, processes the queries, and prints the results.

        There owner watched them for whole day and noted in his sheet where each zebra spitted.
        Now he's in a confusion and wants to know if in the jungle there are two zebra's which spitted at each other.
        Help him solve this task.
        If the zebra is present in position a spits b metres right , he can hit only zebra in position a+b , if such a zebra exists.

        -----Input:-----
        - The first line contains integer t(1<=t<100)- amount of zebras in jungle.
        - Each of following t lines contains two integers a(i) and b(i)(-10^4<=x(i)<=10^4,1<|d(i)|<=2.10^4) - records in owner sheet.
        - a(i) is the position of i-th zebra and b(i) is distance at which the i-th camel spitted.
        Positive values of d(i) correspond to spits right, negative values correspond to spit left.No two zebras may stand in the same position.

        -----Output:-----
        If there are two zebras , which spitted at each other , output YES, otherwise , output NO.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We have a number of zebras in a jungle, each positioned at a unique location. Each zebra can spit a certain distance either to the left or right. We need to determine if there are any two zebras that spit at each other. This means if one zebra spits and hits another, the second zebra should also spit back and hit the first one.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           - For each zebra, calculate the position it can hit by adding its spit distance to its position.
           - Store these positions in a dictionary where the key is the position a zebra can hit, and the value is the position of the zebra that can hit it.
           - For each zebra, check if its position is a key in the dictionary, and if the zebra at that position can hit back the original zebra. If such a pair is found, output "YES". If no such pair is found after checking all zebras, output "NO".

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function check_zebras_spitting(t, zebra_data):
               create an empty dictionary called spit_positions
       
               for each zebra in zebra_data:
                   calculate the hit_position as zebra's position + spit distance
                   store in spit_positions with hit_position as key and zebra's position as value
       
               for each zebra in zebra_data:
                   if zebra's position is in spit_positions:
                       if spit_positions[zebra's position] equals zebra's position + spit distance:
                           return "YES"
       
               return "NO"
           ```

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a number of quotes, and for each quote, we need to determine if it is "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy". A quote is considered "Real Fancy" if it contains the word "not" as a separate word. Otherwise, it is "regularly fancy".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - Read the number of test cases, `T`.
   - For each test case, read the quote `S`.

2. **Check for "not"**:
   - Split the quote `S` into words.
   - Check if the word "not" is present in the list of words.

3. **Output**:
   - If "not" is found, print "Real Fancy".
   - Otherwise, print "regularly fancy".

## Pseudocode

```
function classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for each quote in quotes:
        split the quote into words
        if "not" is in the list of words:
            print "Real Fancy"
        else:
            print "regularly fancy"
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is a separate word in the quote
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])

# The following lines are the quotes
quotes = data[1:T+1]

# Classify each quote
classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into lines. The first line gives us the number of test cases, `T`. The subsequent lines contain the quotes.
- **Word Splitting**: For each quote, we split it into words using the `split()` method, which handles spaces and returns a list of words.
- **Checking for "not"**: We simply check if the word "not" is in the list of words. If it is, the quote is "Real Fancy"; otherwise, it is "regularly fancy".
- **Output**: We print the result for each quote based on the presence of the word "not".

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not" as a separate word. The core concept was to effectively parse and analyze strings to determine the presence of a specific word. The solution involved splitting each quote into words and checking for the presence of "not" in the resulting list.

Key steps included:
- Reading input data and parsing it into individual quotes.
- Using the `split()` method to break each quote into words, which handles spaces and provides a straightforward way to check for the presence of "not".
- Implementing a simple conditional check to determine the output based on whether "not" was found.

The problem was straightforward, and the solution was effective without any unexpected errors. The use of Python's built-in string manipulation functions made the task simple and efficient. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding basic string operations and conditional logic in programming.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of determining whether a quote is "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" based on the presence of the word "not" as a separate word. The key insight is to split the quote into words and check for the presence of "not".

### Key Insights:

1. **Word Splitting**: Both solutions use the `split()` method to break the quote into individual words. This is crucial because it ensures that "not" is checked as a separate word, not as a substring of another word.

2. **Checking for "not"**: The solutions then check if "not" is present in the list of words. This is a straightforward and efficient way to determine the fanciness of the quote.

3. **Loop Structure**: The official solution uses a `while` loop to iterate through the test cases, whereas my solution uses a `for` loop. Both are valid approaches, but the `for` loop is often more Pythonic and concise for iterating over a known range.

### Reflection:

The problem was straightforward, and both solutions are efficient given the constraints. The use of `split()` and checking membership in a list are common techniques in string processing tasks. This exercise reinforces the importance of understanding how to manipulate strings and lists in Python, which is a fundamental skill in many programming problems.

[/Problem]

[Solution]

    def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
        for quote in quotes:
            # Split the quote into words
            words = quote.split()
            # Check if "not" is a separate word in the quote
            if "not" in words:
                print("Real Fancy")
            else:
                print("regularly fancy")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()

    # First line is the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])

    # The following lines are the quotes
    quotes = data[1:T+1]

    # Classify each quote
    classify_quotes(T, quotes)
