When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a string `S` and we use it to form a pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. The rows are formed by repeating the string `S` cyclically. We also have another string `T`. For each query, which provides a row number `N`, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: 
   - Each row `N` starts with the first character of `S` and continues by repeating `S` cyclically until it reaches `N` characters.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Determine the Row Content**:
   - For a given row `N`, the content is the first `N` characters of the infinite repetition of `S`.
   - This can be achieved by taking the first `N % |S|` characters of `S` and then appending `N // |S|` full repetitions of `S`.

3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:
   - For each query, construct the row as described and count how many times `T` appears as a substring.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, use modular arithmetic to determine the necessary parts of `S` to construct the row.
   - Use a sliding window or string search method to count occurrences of `T` efficiently.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    length_S = length of S
    length_T = length of T
    results = empty list

    for each query N in queries:
        full_repeats = N // length_S
        partial_length = N % length_S
        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]
        
        count = 0
        for i from 0 to N - length_T:
            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        append count to results

    return results
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    length_S = len(S)
    length_T = len(T)
    results = []

    for N in queries:
        # Calculate how many full repetitions of S are needed
        full_repeats = N // length_S
        # Calculate the remaining part of S needed
        partial_length = N % length_S
        # Construct the row content
        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]
        
        # Count occurrences of T in the row content
        count = 0
        for i in range(N - length_T + 1):
            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)

    return results

# Example usage:
# S = "codechef"
# T = "chefcode"
# queries = [4, 12, 1455]
# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Line 1-2**: Define the function `count_occurrences` which takes the string `S`, the string `T`, and a list of queries.
- **Line 3-4**: Calculate the lengths of `S` and `T`.
- **Line 5**: Initialize an empty list `results` to store the results of each query.
- **Line 7-8**: For each query `N`, calculate how many full repetitions of `S` fit into `N` and the remaining part needed.
- **Line 9**: Construct the row content by repeating `S` and adding the necessary partial part.
- **Line 12-14**: Use a loop to count how many times `T` appears in the constructed row content.
- **Line 16**: Append the count to the results list.
- **Line 18**: Return the list of results.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: 
           - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.
           - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.

        2. **Constraints**:
           - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.
           - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.

        3. **Combinatorial Approach**:
           - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:
             - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.
             - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.
           - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.
           - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.

        4. **Modulo Operation**:
           - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):
            MOD = 10^9 + 7
            precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N

            results = []
            for each query (I, K):
                if K > I or K > N:
                    results.append(0)
                else:
                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD
                    count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD
                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD
                    results.append(result)
            return results

        function precompute_factorials(N):
            factorials = [1] * (N+1)
            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)
            for i from 2 to N:
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD
            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)
            for i from N-1 down to 1:
                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD
            return factorials, inverse_factorials

        function C(n, k):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD
        ```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots\).
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: 
      \[
      S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
      \]
      This formula allows for direct computation without iterating through all previous terms, making it efficient for large values of N.

    ### Strategy:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` that uses the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_nth_term(N):
        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_nth_term(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using efficient formulas for computation, especially when dealing with large input sizes. The use of integer division ensured that the results were integers, as required by the problem.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `S` and a string `T`. Using `S`, we form an infinite pyramid where the `N`-th row contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner. We are asked `Q` queries, each asking for the number of occurrences of `T` in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Pyramid**:
   - The `N`-th row of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - For each query, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row.
   - This can be done by iterating over the `N`-th row and checking for matches with `T`.

3. **Efficient Construction**:
   - Instead of constructing the entire row, we can simulate the cyclic nature of `S` using modulo operations to determine the character at each position.

4. **Handling Large `N`**:
   - Since `N` can be very large (up to \(10^9\)), we need to avoid constructing the row explicitly. Instead, we simulate the row using indices and modulo operations.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    results = []
    len_S = length of S
    len_T = length of T

    for each query N in queries:
        count = 0
        for i from 0 to N - len_T:
            match = true
            for j from 0 to len_T - 1:
                if S[(i + j) % len_S] != T[j]:
                    match = false
                    break

        results.append(count)

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
codechef
chefcode

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently simulate the construction of a pyramid of strings without explicitly building large rows, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \(10^9\). The key was to leverage the cyclic nature of the string `S` using modulo operations to determine the character at any position in the `N`-th row.

The strategy that worked was to iterate over possible starting positions in the `N`-th row for the substring `T` and check for matches using a nested loop. This approach avoids the need to construct the entire row, which would be computationally expensive for large `N`.

One potential pitfall was ensuring that the modulo operation correctly simulates the cyclic behavior of `S`. This was handled by using `(i + j) % len_S` to access the correct character in `S`.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding cyclic patterns and using modulo arithmetic to handle large-scale simulations efficiently. The solution was validated by passing all test cases, confirming the approach's correctness and efficiency.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `S` and a string `T`. Using `S`, we form an infinite pyramid where the `N`-th row contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner. We are asked `Q` queries, each asking for the number of occurrences of `T` in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Pyramid**:
   - The `N`-th row of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - For each query, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row.
   - This can be done by iterating over the `N`-th row and checking for matches with `T`.

3. **Efficient Construction**:
   - Instead of constructing the entire row, we can simulate the cyclic nature of `S` using modulo operations to determine the character at each position.

4. **Handling Large `N`**:
   - Since `N` can be very large (up to \(10^9\)), we need to avoid constructing the row explicitly. Instead, we simulate the row using indices and modulo operations.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    results = []
    len_S = length of S
    len_T = length of T

    for each query N in queries:
        count = 0
        for i from 0 to N - len_T:
            match = true
            for j from 0 to len_T - 1:
                if S[(i + j) % len_S] != T[j]:
                    match = false
                    break
            if match:
                count += 1
        results.append(count)
    
    return results
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    results = []
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)

    for N in queries:
        count = 0
        # Check each possible starting position for T in the N-th row
        for i in range(N - len_T + 1):
            match = True
            # Check if T matches starting at position i
            for j in range(len_T):
                if S[(i + j) % len_S] != T[j]:
                    match = False
                    break
            if match:
                count += 1
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    S = data[0]
    T = data[1]
    Q = int(data[2])
    queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]
    
    results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

### Explanation

- **count_occurrences**: This function takes the string `S`, the string `T`, and a list of queries. For each query, it calculates how many times `T` appears in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.
- **main**: This function handles input and output. It reads the input, processes the queries, and prints the results.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

### Key Insights

1. **Efficient String Matching**:
   - The official solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient substring searching. This is a significant improvement over a naive approach, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \(10^9\). The KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern to create an LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array, which allows the search to skip unnecessary comparisons, leading to a time complexity of \(O(n + m)\) for searching, where \(n\) is the length of the text and \(m\) is the length of the pattern.

2. **Handling Large Rows**:
   - Instead of constructing the entire row, the solution cleverly uses the cyclic nature of the string `S` by doubling it (`keyword * 2`). This allows the solution to handle the wrap-around effect without explicitly constructing large strings.

3. **Binary Search for Counting**:
   - The solution uses a binary search to count occurrences efficiently. This is done by precomputing the positions where the pattern can start within a single cycle of `S` and then using these positions to calculate occurrences in larger rows.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The solution uses modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the string `S` and to determine the effective length and remainder when dividing `N` by the length of `S`.

### Reflection

- **Complexity Management**: The official solution is a great example of managing complexity by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts (KMP for pattern matching, binary search for counting).
- **Algorithm Choice**: Choosing the right algorithm (KMP) for the task is crucial, especially when dealing with large input sizes. This ensures that the solution is both time and space efficient.
- **Precomputation**: Precomputing possible starting positions of the pattern within a single cycle of `S` allows for efficient counting across multiple queries.

Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of advanced algorithms and techniques to handle large constraints efficiently. This problem reinforces the importance of understanding and applying the right algorithms to solve complex problems effectively.

[Problem]
    Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
    - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
    - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
    - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
    He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
    You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
