    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently simulate the construction of a pyramid of strings without explicitly building large rows, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \\(10^9\\). The key was to leverage the cyclic nature of the string `S` using modulo operations to determine the character at any position in the `N`-th row.\n\nThe strategy that worked was to iterate over possible starting positions in the `N`-th row for the substring `T` and check for matches using a nested loop. This approach avoids the need to construct the entire row, which would be computationally expensive for large `N`.\n\nOne potential pitfall was ensuring that the modulo operation correctly simulates the cyclic behavior of `S`. This was handled by using `(i + j) % len_S` to access the correct character in `S`.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding cyclic patterns and using modulo arithmetic to handle large-scale simulations efficiently. The solution was validated by passing all test cases, confirming the approach's correctness and efficiency.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Efficient String Matching**:\n   - The official solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient substring searching. This is a significant improvement over a naive approach, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \\(10^9\\). The KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern to create an LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array, which allows the search to skip unnecessary comparisons, leading to a time complexity of \\(O(n + m)\\) for searching, where \\(n\\) is the length of the text and \\(m\\) is the length of the pattern.\n\n2. **Handling Large Rows**:\n   - Instead of constructing the entire row, the solution cleverly uses the cyclic nature of the string `S` by doubling it (`keyword * 2`). This allows the solution to handle the wrap-around effect without explicitly constructing large strings.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Counting**:\n   - The solution uses a binary search to count occurrences efficiently. This is done by precomputing the positions where the pattern can start within a single cycle of `S` and then using these positions to calculate occurrences in larger rows.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**:\n   - The solution uses modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the string `S` and to determine the effective length and remainder when dividing `N` by the length of `S`.\n\n### Reflection\n\n- **Complexity Management**: The official solution is a great example of managing complexity by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts (KMP for pattern matching, binary search for counting).\n- **Algorithm Choice**: Choosing the right algorithm (KMP) for the task is crucial, especially when dealing with large input sizes. This ensures that the solution is both time and space efficient.\n- **Precomputation**: Precomputing possible starting positions of the pattern within a single cycle of `S` allows for efficient counting across multiple queries.\n\nOverall, the official solution is insightful in its use of advanced algorithms and techniques to handle large constraints efficiently. This problem reinforces the importance of understanding and applying the right algorithms to solve complex problems effectively.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes two strings, S and T, followed by an integer Q and a list of Q integers representing queries. It then calls another function to determine how many times the string T can be found as a contiguous substring in a cyclically repeated version of S for each query value. The results for each query are collected and printed line by line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze patterns in cyclic sequences or strings, especially when dealing with large datasets or strings that repeat in a predictable manner. It is particularly relevant in competitive programming, text processing, and data analysis tasks where you need to efficiently count occurrences of a substring within a larger, cyclically repeating string. The problem also highlights the importance of understanding modular arithmetic and efficient string matching techniques, which are crucial in optimizing performance for large input sizes, as seen in the constraints of this problem."
