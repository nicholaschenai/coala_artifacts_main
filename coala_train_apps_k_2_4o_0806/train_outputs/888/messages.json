The rows are formed by repeating the string `S` cyclically. We also have another string `T`. For each query, which provides a row number `N`, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: \n   - Each row `N` starts with the first character of `S` and continues by repeating `S` cyclically until it reaches `N` characters.\n   - For example, if `S = \"codechef\"`, the 12th row would be `\"codechefcode\"`.\n\n2. **Determine the Row Content**:\n   - For a given row `N`, the content is the first `N` characters of the infinite repetition of `S`.\n   - This can be achieved by taking the first `N % |S|` characters of `S` and then appending `N // |S|` full repetitions of `S`.\n\n3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:\n   - For each query, construct the row as described and count how many times `T` appears as a substring.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**:\n   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, use modular arithmetic to determine the necessary parts of `S` to construct the row.\n   - Use a sliding window or string search method to count occurrences of `T` efficiently.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    length_S = length of S\n    length_T = length of T\n    results = empty list\n\n    for each query N in queries:\n        full_repeats = N // length_S\n        partial_length = N % length_S\n        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]\n        \n        count = 0\n        for i from 0 to N - length_T:\n            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        append count to results\n\n    return results\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    length_S = len(S)\n    length_T = len(T)\n    results = []\n\n    for N in queries:\n        # Calculate how many full repetitions of S are needed\n        full_repeats = N // length_S\n        # Calculate the remaining part of S needed\n        partial_length = N % length_S\n        # Construct the row content\n        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]\n        \n        # Count occurrences of T in the row content\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(N - length_T + 1):\n            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        results.append(count)\n\n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# S = \"codechef\"\n# T = \"chefcode\"\n# queries = [4, 12, 1455]\n# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Line 1-2**: Define the function `count_occurrences` which takes the string `S`, the string `T`, and a list of queries.\n- **Line 3-4**: Calculate the lengths of `S` and `T`.\n- **Line 5**: Initialize an empty list `results` to store the results of each query.\n- **Line 7-8**: For each query `N`, calculate how many full repetitions of `S` fit into `N` and the remaining part needed.\n- **Line 9**: Construct the row content by repeating `S` and adding the necessary partial part.\n- **Line 12-14**: Use a loop to count how many times `T` appears in the constructed row content.\n- **Line 16**: Append the count to the results list.\n- **Line 18**: Return the list of results."

Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: \n           - A subset of a set of numbers is any combination of those numbers, including the empty set and the set itself.\n           - When a subset is sorted, the position of a number in the subset is determined by its order in the sorted list.\n\n        2. **Constraints**:\n           - We need to find subsets where a specific number `I` is at position `K` in the sorted order.\n           - If `K` is greater than `N`, or if `I` is less than `K`, the result is 0 because it's impossible for `I` to be at position `K`.\n\n        3. **Combinatorial Approach**:\n           - For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset:\n             - There must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset.\n             - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than `I`.\n           - The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers less than `I` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(I-1, K-1)`.\n           - The number of ways to choose any subset of the numbers greater than `I` is `2^(N-I)`.\n\n        4. **Modulo Operation**:\n           - Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10^9 + 7\n            precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N\n\n            results = []\n            for each query (I, K):\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1) % MOD\n                    count_greater = 2^(N-I) % MOD\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        function precompute_factorials(N):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i from 2 to N:\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i from N-1 down to 1:\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        function C(n, k):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries):\n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n            # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n            factorials, inverse_factorials = precompute_factorials(N, MOD)\n    \n            results = []\n            for I, K in queries:\n                if K > I or K > N:\n                    results.append(0)\n                else:\n                    count_less = C(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD)\n                    count_greater = pow(2, N-I, MOD)\n                    result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                    results.append(result)\n            return results\n\n        def precompute_factorials(N, MOD):\n            factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            inverse_factorials = [1] * (N+1)\n            for i in range(2, N+1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % MOD\n            inverse_factorials[N] = pow(factorials[N], MOD-2, MOD)\n            for i in range(N-1, 0, -1):\n                inverse_factorials[i] = (inverse_factorials[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n            return factorials, inverse_factorials\n\n        def C(n, k, factorials, inverse_factorials, MOD):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % MOD) * inverse_factorials[n-k] % MOD\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                queries = []\n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n                    queries.append((I, K))\n        \n                results.extend(calculate_subsets(N, Q, queries))\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently calculates the number of subsets for each query by precomputing factorials and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '3 3', '1 2', '2 1', '3 2'] Output: 0\n        2\n        2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases.

Using `S`, we form an infinite pyramid where the `N`-th row contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner. We are asked `Q` queries, each asking for the number of occurrences of `T` in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Pyramid**:\n   - The `N`-th row of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.\n   - For example, if `S = \"codechef\"`, the 12th row would be `\"codechefcode\"`.\n\n2. **Finding Occurrences**:\n   - For each query, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row.\n   - This can be done by iterating over the `N`-th row and checking for matches with `T`.\n\n3. **Efficient Construction**:\n   - Instead of constructing the entire row, we can simulate the cyclic nature of `S` using modulo operations to determine the character at each position.\n\n4. **Handling Large `N`**:\n   - Since `N` can be very large (up to \\(10^9\\)), we need to avoid constructing the row explicitly.

        "content": "In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently simulate the construction of a pyramid of strings without explicitly building large rows, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \\(10^9\\). The key was to leverage the cyclic nature of the string `S` using modulo operations to determine the character at any position in the `N`-th row.\n\nThe strategy that worked was to iterate over possible starting positions in the `N`-th row for the substring `T` and check for matches using a nested loop. This approach avoids the need to construct the entire row, which would be computationally expensive for large `N`.\n\nOne potential pitfall was ensuring that the modulo operation correctly simulates the cyclic behavior of `S`. This was handled by using `(i + j) % len_S` to access the correct character in `S`.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding cyclic patterns and using modulo arithmetic to handle large-scale simulations efficiently. The solution was validated by passing all test cases, confirming the approach's correctness and efficiency."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Efficient String Matching**:\n   - The official solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient substring searching. This is a significant improvement over a naive approach, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \\(10^9\\). The KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern to create an LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array, which allows the search to skip unnecessary comparisons, leading to a time complexity of \\(O(n + m)\\) for searching, where \\(n\\) is the length of the text and \\(m\\) is the length of the pattern.\n\n2. **Handling Large Rows**:\n   - Instead of constructing the entire row, the solution cleverly uses the cyclic nature of the string `S` by doubling it (`keyword * 2`). This allows the solution to handle the wrap-around effect without explicitly constructing large strings.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Counting**:\n   - The solution uses a binary search to count occurrences efficiently. This is done by precomputing the positions where the pattern can start within a single cycle of `S` and then using these positions to calculate occurrences in larger rows.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**:\n   - The solution uses modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the string `S` and to determine the effective length and remainder when dividing `N` by the length of `S`.\n\n### Reflection\n\n- **Complexity Management**: The official solution is a great example of managing complexity by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts (KMP for pattern matching, binary search for counting).\n- **Algorithm Choice**: Choosing the right algorithm (KMP) for the task is crucial, especially when dealing with large input sizes. This ensures that the solution is both time and space efficient.\n- **Precomputation**: Precomputing possible starting positions of the pattern within a single cycle of `S` allows for efficient counting across multiple queries.\n\nOverall, the official solution is insightful in its use of advanced algorithms and techniques to handle large constraints efficiently. This problem reinforces the importance of understanding and applying the right algorithms to solve complex problems effectively."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes two strings, S and T, followed by an integer Q and a list of Q integers representing queries. It then calls another function to determine how many times the string T can be found as a contiguous substring in a cyclically repeated version of S for each query value. The results for each query are collected and printed line by line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze patterns in cyclic sequences or strings, especially when dealing with large datasets or strings that repeat in a predictable manner. It is particularly relevant in competitive programming, text processing, and data analysis tasks where you need to efficiently count occurrences of a substring within a larger, cyclically repeating string. The problem also highlights the importance of understanding modular arithmetic and efficient string matching techniques, which are crucial in optimizing performance for large input sizes, as seen in the constraints of this problem."
