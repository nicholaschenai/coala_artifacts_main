    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a string `S` and a string `T`. Using `S`, we form an infinite pyramid where the `N`-th row contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner. We are asked `Q` queries, each asking for the number of occurrences of `T` in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Pyramid**:\n   - The `N`-th row of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.\n   - For example, if `S = \"codechef\"`, the 12th row would be `\"codechefcode\"`.\n\n2. **Finding Occurrences**:\n   - For each query, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row.\n   - This can be done by iterating over the `N`-th row and checking for matches with `T`.\n\n3. **Efficient Construction**:\n   - Instead of constructing the entire row, we can simulate the cyclic nature of `S` using modulo operations to determine the character at each position.\n\n4. **Handling Large `N`**:\n   - Since `N` can be very large (up to \\(10^9\\)), we need to avoid constructing the row explicitly. Instead, we simulate the row using indices and modulo operations.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    results = []\n    len_S = length of S\n    len_T = length of T\n\n    for each query N in queries:\n        count = 0\n        for i from 0 to N - len_T:\n            match = true\n            for j from 0 to len_T - 1:\n                if S[(i + j) % len_S] != T[j]:\n                    match = false\n                    break\n            if match:\n                count += 1\n        results.append(count)\n    \n    return results\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    results = []\n    len_S = len(S)\n    len_T = len(T)\n\n    for N in queries:\n        count = 0\n        # Check each possible starting position for T in the N-th row\n        for i in range(N - len_T + 1):\n            match = True\n            # Check if T matches starting at position i\n            for j in range(len_T):\n                if S[(i + j) % len_S] != T[j]:\n                    match = False\n                    break\n            if match:\n                count += 1\n        results.append(count)\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    S = data[0]\n    T = data[1]\n    Q = int(data[2])\n    queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]\n    \n    results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **count_occurrences**: This function takes the string `S`, the string `T`, and a list of queries. For each query, it calculates how many times `T` appears in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n- **main**: This function handles input and output. It reads the input, processes the queries, and prints the results.",
