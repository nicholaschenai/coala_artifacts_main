INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a positive integer `n`. We need to transform `n` into `1` using the fewest number of operations. The operations allowed are:
- If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.
- If `n` is odd, replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers:
- For even numbers, the best operation is to divide by 2, as it reduces the number significantly.
- For odd numbers, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice should be made based on which operation will lead to a faster reduction to `1`.

For odd numbers:
- If `n` is `3`, decrementing to `2` is optimal because `2` can be halved to `1` in one step.
- For other odd numbers, we should consider the binary representation of `n`. If `n + 1` has more trailing zeros than `n - 1`, it is generally better to increment because it will lead to more divisions by 2 in subsequent steps.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a counter `steps` to 0.
2. While `n` is not equal to 1:
   - If `n` is even, divide `n` by 2.
   - If `n` is odd:
     - If `n` is 3, decrement `n` to 2.
     - Otherwise, check the number of trailing zeros in `n + 1` and `n - 1`.
     - If `n + 1` has more trailing zeros, increment `n`.
     - Otherwise, decrement `n`.
   - Increment the `steps` counter.
3. Return the `steps` counter.

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
        steps = 0
        while n != 1:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                # If n is even, divide by 2
                n //= 2
            else:
                # If n is odd
                if n == 3:
                    # Special case for 3, decrement to 2
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    # Check the number of trailing zeros in n+1 and n-1
                    if (n + 1) % 4 == 0 and n != 3:
                        n += 1
                    else:
                        n -= 1
            steps += 1
        return steps
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize `steps` to count the number of operations.
- We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.
- For even `n`, we simply divide by 2.
- For odd `n`, we handle the special case of `3` separately by decrementing to `2`.
- For other odd numbers, we decide between incrementing or decrementing based on the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of `n + 1` and `n - 1`.
- We increment the `steps` counter for each operation performed.
- Finally, we return the total number of steps taken to reduce `n` to `1`.

    Title: Josephus Problem
    Part: 1/1
    # Josephus Problem

    ## Statement

    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.
    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. 
    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.
    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.
    The process stops when one number remains.
    It is required to find the last number.

    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).

    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.
    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \log n)$.
    We want something better though.

    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution

    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.

    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:

    $$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
    n\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\
    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\
    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\
    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\
    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\
    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\
    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\
    \end{array}$$

    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:

    $$J_{n,k} = \left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \bmod n \right) + 1$$

    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$

    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:

    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \bmod n$$

    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.

    ## Implementation

    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;
    }
    ```

    **Non-recursive form** :

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
      	  res = (res + k) % i;
        return res + 1;
    }
    ```

    This formula can also be found analytically.
    Again here we assume 0-indexing.
    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.
    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \bmod n$.
    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \ \bmod n$.

    ## Modeling a $O(k \log n)$ solution

    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.
    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$) in one run without looping over.
    Afterwards we have $n - \lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k)$-th number.
    So we have to shift by that many.
    We can notice that $\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k$ is simply $-n \bmod k$.
    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.
    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.

    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.

    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;
        if (k == 1)
            return n-1;
        if (k > n)
            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;
        int cnt = n / k;
        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);
        res -= n % k;
        if (res < 0)
            res += n;
        else
            res += res / (k - 1);
        return res;
    }
    ```

    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:

    $$ n \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) ^ x = 1, $$

    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:

    $$\ln n + x \ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) = 0,$$ 
    $$x = - \frac{\ln n}{\ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)},$$

    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:

    $$x \approx k \ln n$$

    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \log n)$.

    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$

    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.

    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):

    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$

    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:

    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$

    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, "restarting" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:

    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \left(n-2^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor} \right)$$

    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$

    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler "The Josephus Problem" and Odlyzko, Wilf "Functional iteration and the Josephus problem").
[/Textbook Reference Material]


[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of summing multiples of 10 up to a given number \( N \). However, there are some differences in implementation that are worth noting:

    1. **Efficiency and Simplicity:**
       - The official solution is more concise. It directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to \( N \) by using `n -= n % 10`, which is a straightforward way to adjust \( N \) to the nearest lower multiple of 10.
       - It then divides by 10 and uses the arithmetic series formula in a single line to compute the sum, which is efficient and easy to read.

    2. **Use of Integer Division:**
       - My solution uses integer division (`//`) to ensure that the operations remain within integer arithmetic, which is important for large numbers to avoid floating-point precision issues.
       - The official solution uses regular division (`/`), which in Python 3 results in a float. This is acceptable here because the arithmetic operations are simple and Python handles large integers well, but using integer division is generally safer for integer-only operations.

    3. **Code Readability:**
       - My solution separates the logic into a function and uses comments to explain each step, which can be helpful for understanding and maintaining the code.
       - The official solution is more compact and may be preferred in competitive programming settings where brevity is valued.

    Overall, both solutions are correct and efficient, but the official solution demonstrates a more concise approach that leverages Python's handling of arithmetic operations effectively. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding both concise and verbose coding styles, as well as the implications of using different types of division in Python.

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a positive integer `n`. We need to transform `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:
- If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.
- If `n` is odd, replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach:
1. If `n` is even, the best move is to divide it by 2, as this reduces `n` significantly.
2. If `n` is odd, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice should be made based on which operation will lead to a number that is easier to reduce to 1. Generally, if `n + 1` or `n - 1` results in a number that is divisible by 4, it is preferable because it allows for more divisions by 2 in subsequent steps.

### Pseudocode

```
function integerReplacement(n):
    count = 0
    while n is not 1:
        if n is even:
            n = n / 2
        else:
            if n is 3 or n - 1 is divisible by 4:
                n = n - 1
            else:
                n = n + 1
        count = count + 1
    return count
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n != 1:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                # If n is even, divide by 2
                n //= 2
            else:
                # If n is odd, decide whether to increment or decrement
                # Prefer decrement if n is 3 or n-1 is divisible by 4
                if n == 3 or (n & 2) == 0:
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    n += 1
            count += 1
        return count
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize a counter `count` to track the number of operations.
- We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.
- If `n` is even, we divide it by 2.
- If `n` is odd, we check if `n` is `3` or if `n-1` is divisible by 4. In these cases, decrementing is more beneficial. Otherwise, we increment `n`.
- We increment the `count` for each operation performed.
- Finally, we return the `count` as the minimum number of operations needed.

We are given a positive integer `n`. We need to transform `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:
- If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.
- If `n` is odd, replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach:
1. If `n` is even, the best move is to divide it by 2, as this reduces `n` significantly.
2. If `n` is odd, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice should be made based on which operation will lead to a number that is easier to reduce to 1. Generally, if `n + 1` or `n - 1` results in a number that is divisible by 4, it is preferable because it allows for more divisions by 2 in subsequent steps.

### Pseudocode

```
function integerReplacement(n):
    count = 0
    while n is not 1:
        if n is even:
            n = n / 2
        else:
            if n is 3 or n - 1 is divisible by 4:
                n = n - 1
            else:
                n = n + 1
        count = count + 1
    return count
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n != 1:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                # If n is even, divide by 2
                n //= 2
            else:
                # If n is odd, decide whether to increment or decrement
                # Prefer decrement if n is 3 or n-1 is divisible by 4
                if n == 3 or (n & 2) == 0:
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    n += 1
            count += 1
        return count
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize a counter `count` to track the number of operations.
- We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.
- If `n` is even, we divide it by 2.
- If `n` is odd, we check if `n` is `3` or if `n-1` is divisible by 4. In these cases, decrementing is more beneficial. Otherwise, we increment `n`.
- We increment the `count` for each operation performed.
- Finally, we return the `count` as the minimum number of operations needed.

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The challenge was to determine the optimal choice when `n` is odd to minimize the total number of operations.

The core concept here is a greedy approach, where the decision at each step is made to reduce `n` as quickly as possible. For even numbers, the choice is straightforward: divide by 2. For odd numbers, the decision is based on whether incrementing or decrementing will lead to a number that is more easily reduced in subsequent steps. Specifically, if `n` is 3 or `n-1` is divisible by 4, decrementing is preferred. Otherwise, incrementing is the better choice.

The solution was implemented using a loop that continues until `n` becomes 1, with a counter to track the number of operations. The logic for choosing between incrementing and decrementing was based on bitwise operations to check divisibility by 4, which is efficient and straightforward.

This problem reinforced the importance of making optimal local decisions in a greedy algorithm to achieve a globally optimal solution. The use of bitwise operations for efficiency was also a key takeaway. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness of the approach.

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] The problem of reducing a number `n` to `1` using the minimum number of operations is a classic example of a greedy algorithm. The official solution and my approach both utilize a similar strategy, focusing on whether `n` is even or odd to decide the next step. Here are some key insights from the problem-solving process:

1. **Greedy Approach**: Both solutions use a greedy approach to decide the next operation. When `n` is even, dividing by 2 is the optimal choice. When `n` is odd, the decision to increment or decrement is based on the potential to make `n` divisible by 4, which allows for more efficient reductions in subsequent steps.

2. **Handling Odd Numbers**: The official solution and my approach both recognize that when `n` is odd, the choice between `n + 1` and `n - 1` should be made based on the divisibility by 4. This is because a number that is divisible by 4 can be halved twice consecutively, leading to a faster reduction.

3. **Special Case for `n = 3`**: Both solutions handle the special case where `n = 3` by choosing to decrement, as this leads directly to `2`, which can then be halved to reach `1`.

4. **Iterative vs. Recursive**: The official solution provides a commented-out recursive approach, which is elegant but may not be as efficient as the iterative approach due to potential stack overflow issues with large `n`. The iterative approach is more practical for handling large inputs.

Overall, the problem reinforces the importance of understanding the properties of numbers (such as divisibility) and using them to make optimal decisions in a greedy algorithm. The iterative approach is efficient and straightforward, making it a robust solution for this problem.

[description]
The function calculates the minimum number of operations required to reduce a given integer to 1. If the integer is even, it is divided by 2. If the integer is odd, the function decides whether to increment or decrement the integer based on specific conditions: it decrements if the...,
