    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a positive integer `n`. We need to transform `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:\n- If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.\n- If `n` is odd, replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.\n\nThe task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach:\n1. If `n` is even, the best move is to divide it by 2, as this reduces `n` significantly.\n2. If `n` is odd, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice should be made based on which operation will lead to a number that is easier to reduce to 1. Generally, if `n + 1` or `n - 1` results in a number that is divisible by 4, it is preferable because it allows for more divisions by 2 in subsequent steps.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction integerReplacement(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n is not 1:\n        if n is even:\n            n = n / 2\n        else:\n            if n is 3 or n - 1 is divisible by 4:\n                n = n - 1\n            else:\n                n = n + 1\n        count = count + 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n        count = 0\n        while n != 1:\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                # If n is even, divide by 2\n                n //= 2\n            else:\n                # If n is odd, decide whether to increment or decrement\n                # Prefer decrement if n is 3 or n-1 is divisible by 4\n                if n == 3 or (n & 2) == 0:\n                    n -= 1\n                else:\n                    n += 1\n            count += 1\n        return count\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We initialize a counter `count` to track the number of operations.\n- We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.\n- If `n` is even, we divide it by 2.\n- If `n` is odd, we check if `n` is `3` or if `n-1` is divisible by 4. In these cases, decrementing is more beneficial. Otherwise, we increment `n`.\n- We increment the `count` for each operation performed.\n- Finally, we return the `count` as the minimum number of operations needed.",
