    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to rooms in two houses. Each box `i` contains `i` tiles, and each house has `N` rooms with areas from `1x1` to `NxN`. The goal is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, with the constraint that each room in one house must be paired with a room in the other house, and both must be tiled using the same number of tiles from a single box.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - Each box `i` has `i` tiles.\n   - Each room `i` in a house requires `i*i` tiles to be completely tiled.\n   - We need to find pairs of rooms (one from each house) that can be completely tiled using tiles from a single box.\n\n2. **Strategy**:\n   - For a room `i` to be completely tiled, the number of tiles `i` from the box must be able to tile two rooms, each requiring `i*i` tiles.\n   - This means `i` must be a perfect square because only then can `i` tiles be split evenly to tile two rooms of size `i*i`.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - For each test case, determine the largest integer `k` such that `k*k <= N`.\n   - The number of rooms that can be completely tiled is `k` because only perfect squares can be split evenly to tile two rooms.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each N in test_cases:\n        k = floor(sqrt(N))\n        results.append(k)\n    return results\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        # Calculate the largest integer k such that k*k <= N\n        k = int(N**0.5)\n        results.append(k)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **count_tiled_rooms Function**: This function reads the number of test cases and the value of `N` for each test case. It calculates the largest integer `k` such that `k*k <= N` using the square root function. This `k` represents the number of rooms that can be completely tiled.\n- **Input Handling**: The function reads input from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming environments.\n- **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the number of rooms that can be completely tiled.",
