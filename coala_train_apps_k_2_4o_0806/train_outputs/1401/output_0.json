    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a limited amount of money. Given a list of chocolate prices and a total amount she can spend, we need to determine the maximum number of chocolates she can purchase without exceeding her budget.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To maximize the number of chocolates Anushka can buy, we should start by purchasing the cheapest chocolates first. This way, we can buy more chocolates before reaching the spending limit. We will sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order and then iterate through the sorted list, adding the price of each chocolate to a running total until adding another chocolate would exceed the budget. The number of chocolates added to the total before exceeding the budget is the maximum number Anushka can buy.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n       sort prices in ascending order\n       total_spent = 0\n       count = 0\n       for each price in prices:\n           if total_spent + price <= k:\n               total_spent += price\n               count += 1\n           else:\n               break\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n    # Sort the prices in ascending order to buy cheaper chocolates first\n    prices.sort()\n    \n    total_spent = 0  # Initialize the total amount spent\n    count = 0  # Initialize the count of chocolates bought\n    \n    # Iterate over the sorted prices\n    for price in prices:\n        # Check if adding this chocolate's price exceeds the budget\n        if total_spent + price <= k:\n            total_spent += price  # Add the price to the total spent\n            count += 1  # Increment the count of chocolates bought\n        else:\n            break  # Stop if the budget is exceeded\n    \n    return count  # Return the maximum number of chocolates that can be bought\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy by sorting the prices and iterating through them, ensuring the solution is optimal and runs in O(n log n) time due to the sorting step.",
