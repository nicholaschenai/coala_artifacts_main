[description for function: count_col_triang]
The function takes a list of points, each associated with a color, and calculates several statistics about these points. It first counts the total number of points and groups them by color. For each color group, it calculates the number of non-collinear triangles that can be formed from the points of that color. It keeps track of the maximum number of triangles formed by any color and the colors that achieve this maximum. Finally, it returns a list containing the total number of points, the number of distinct colors, the total number of non-collinear triangles across all colors, and a sorted list of colors that form the maximum number of triangles, followed by the maximum number itself.

This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze geometric properties of points on a plane, particularly when dealing with problems involving collinearity and triangle formation. It is applicable in computational geometry, computer graphics, and spatial data analysis where determining the number of possible triangles from a set of points is required. This can be useful in applications such as geographic information systems (GIS), computer-aided design (CAD), and any field that requires spatial reasoning or pattern recognition. The solution also demonstrates how to handle and process data grouped by categories (in this case, colors), which is a common task in data analysis and programming.
