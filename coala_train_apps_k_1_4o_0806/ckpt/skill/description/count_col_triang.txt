[description for function: count_col_triang]
The function takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a point and its associated color, and calculates the total number of points, the number of distinct colors, and the total number of non-collinear triangles that can be formed within each color group. It also identifies the color(s) that can form the maximum number of such triangles and returns a list containing the total number of points, the number of colors, the total number of triangles, and the color(s) with the maximum triangles along with the count of those triangles. If no triangles can be formed, it returns an empty list for the colors.

This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze geometric properties of points on a plane, particularly when dealing with problems involving collinearity and triangle formation. It is applicable in computational geometry, computer graphics, and spatial data analysis where determining the number of possible triangles from a set of points is necessary. This can be useful in applications such as geographic information systems (GIS), robotics (for path planning and obstacle avoidance), and in any field that requires spatial reasoning and analysis of point distributions. The solution also provides a method to handle and categorize data based on attributes (colors in this case), which is a common requirement in data processing and analysis tasks.
