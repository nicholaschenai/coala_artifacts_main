The following picture shows the distribution of the points in the plane with the required triangles.\n\n![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/sP0l1i1.png)\n\nThe input that we will have for the field of lattice points described above is:\n\n```\n[[[3, -4], \"blue\"],  [[-7, -1], \"red\"], [[7, -6], \"yellow\"], [[2, 5], \"yellow\"],\n [[1, -5], \"red\"],   [[-1, 4], \"red\"],  [[1, 7], \"red\"],     [[-3, 5], \"red\"], \n [[-3, -5], \"blue\"], [[4, 1], \"blue\"] ]\n```\nWe see the following result from it:\n\n```\nColour   Amount of Triangles       Triangles\nYellow         0                    -------\nBlue           1                      AIJ\nRed            10                   BEF,BEG,BEH,BFG,BFH,BGH,EFG,EFH,EHG,FGH\n```\nAs we have 5 different points in red and each combination of 3 points that are not aligned.\n\nWe need a code that may give us the following information in order:\n\n```\n1) Total given points\n2) Total number of colours\n3) Total number of possible triangles\n4) and 5) The colour (or colours, sorted alphabetically) with the highest amount of triangles\n```\n\nIn Python our function will work like:\n\n```\n[10, 3, 11, [\"red\",10]]) == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], \"blue\"],  [[-7, -1], \"red\"], [[7, -6], \"yellow\"], [[2, 5], \"yellow\"], \n                                              [[1, -5], \"red\"],   [[-1, 4], \"red\"],  [[1, 7], \"red\"],     [[-3, 5], \"red\"],\n                                              [[-3, -5], \"blue\"], [[4, 1], \"blue\"] ])\n```\nIn the following case we have some points that are aligned and we have less triangles that can be formed:\n\n```\n[10, 3, 7, [\"red\", 6]] == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], \"blue\"],  [[-7, -1], \"red\"], [[7, -6], \"yellow\"], [[2, 5], \"yellow\"],\n                                            [[1, -5], \"red\"],   [[1, 1], \"red\"],   [[1, 7], \"red\"],     [[1, 4], \"red\"], \n                                            [[-3, -5], \"blue\"], [[4, 1], \"blue\"] ])\n```\nJust to see the change with the previous case we have this:\n\n![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/cCgO7ql.png)\n\nIn the special case that the list of points does not generate an even single triangle, the output will be like this case:\n\n```\n[9, 3, 0, []] == count_col_triang([[[1, -2], \"red\"], [[7, -6], \"yellow\"], [[2, 5], \"yellow\"], [[1, -5], \"red\"],\n                                  [[1, 1], \"red\"],   [[1, 7], \"red\"],     [[1, 4], \"red\"],    [[-3, -5], \"blue\"], \n                                  [[4, 1], \"blue\"] ])\n```\nIt will be this case:\n\n![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/VB7t7Ij.png)\n\nIf in the result we have two or more colours with the same maximum amount of triangles, the last list should be like (e.g)\n\n```\n[35, 6, 35, [\"blue\", \"red\", \"yellow\", 23]]     # having the names of the colours sorted alphabetically\n```\nFor the condition of three algined points A, B, C, you should know that the the following determinant should be 0.\n\n```\n | xA    yA    1|\n | xB    yB    1|    = 0\n | xC    yC    1|\n\n```\nAssumptions:\n\n- In the list you have unique points, so a point can have only one colour.\n\n- All the inputs are valid\n\nEnjoy it!\n\n````if:java\n---\n\n___For java users:___\n\nTwo immutable objects, `ColouredPoint` and `TriangleResult`, have been designed for you in the preloaded part. You will receive inputs as lists of ColouredPoint objects and will return a TriangleResult object. For the last one, you may note the organization of the arguments of the constructor which differs a bit from the description above.\n\nYou may find below the signatures of the available methods of these objects:\n\n````",
        "description": "\n[description for function: count_col_triang]\nThe function takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a point and its associated color, and calculates the total number of points, the number of distinct colors, and the total number of non-collinear triangles that can be formed within each color group. It also identifies the color(s) that can form the maximum number of such triangles and returns a list containing the total number of points, the number of colors, the total number of triangles, and the color(s) with the maximum triangles along with the count of those triangles. If no triangles can be formed, it returns an empty list for the colors.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze geometric properties of points on a plane, particularly when dealing with problems involving collinearity and triangle formation. It is applicable in computational geometry, computer graphics, and spatial data analysis where determining the number of possible triangles from a set of points is necessary. This can be useful in applications such as geographic information systems (GIS), robotics (for path planning and obstacle avoidance), and in any field that requires spatial reasoning and analysis of point distributions. The solution also provides a method to handle and categorize data based on attributes (colors in this case), which is a common requirement in data processing and analysis tasks."
