In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence \"good\" (i.e., sum to zero) for each test case.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Operation**: For each element `A[i]` in the sequence, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.\n\n2. **Sum of the Sequence**: The goal is to make the sum of the sequence zero. If the initial sum of the sequence is `S`, we need to determine if we can adjust the sequence such that the sum becomes zero.\n\n3. **Feasibility Check**: \n   - For each index `i`, we can reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`. \n   - Therefore, the sum `S` can be adjusted by any combination of `i` values.\n   - The key observation is that if the sum of the sequence `S` is divisible by the sum of indices `1 + 2 + ... + N`, then it is possible to make the sequence good.\n\n4. **Implementation Strategy**:\n   - Calculate the sum of the sequence `S`.\n   - Calculate the sum of indices `1 + 2 + ... + N`, which is `N * (N + 1) / 2`.\n   - Check if `S` is divisible by this sum of indices.

The pattern for each test case consists of `K` lines, where each line `i` (0-indexed) should display numbers from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `1` up to `i`. This requires understanding how to manipulate loops to generate sequences in both ascending and descending order.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n    Initially, the logic for generating the pattern was incorrect. The mistake was in the sequence generation, where the numbers were not being appended in the correct order. The expected pattern was misunderstood, leading to incorrect outputs. The key realization was that each line should start with a descending sequence from `i` to `0` and then an ascending sequence from `1` to `i`.\n\n    Another issue was with the output formatting. The solution initially added extra newlines between test cases, which was not required. This was fixed by carefully managing the output to ensure that test cases are separated correctly without trailing newlines.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The final solution correctly implements the pattern generation by:\n    - Using nested loops to construct each line of the pattern.\n    - Ensuring the correct order of numbers for each line.\n    - Managing the output format to match the expected results without extra newlines.\n\n    Here is the corrected code snippet:\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for K in test_cases:\n            pattern = []\n            for i in range(K):\n                line = \"\"\n                # Append numbers from i down to 0\n                for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                    line += str(j)\n                # Append numbers from 1 up to i\n                for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                    line += str(j)\n                pattern.append(line)\n            results.append(\"\\n\".join(pattern))\n        # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases\n        print(\"\\n\\n\".join(results))\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\n    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and carefully managing output formatting in competitive programming problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It iterates over each element in the sequence, adding it to `current_sum`. After adding each element, it checks if `current_sum` is negative. If it is, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop because it's impossible to adjust the sequence to sum to zero.\n\n- **Adjusting the Sum**: After adding each element, the code subtracts the index `i` from `current_sum` to simulate the operation of decreasing the element by its index.\n\n- **Final Check**: After processing all elements, if `possible` is still `True` and `current_sum` is zero, it prints \"YES\". Otherwise, it prints \"NO\". This ensures that the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero."

The pattern for each test case consists of `K` lines, where each line `i` (0-indexed) should display numbers from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `1` up to `i`. This requires understanding how to manipulate loops to generate sequences in both ascending and descending order.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n    Initially, the logic for generating the pattern was incorrect. The mistake was in the sequence generation, where the numbers were not being appended in the correct order. The expected pattern was misunderstood, leading to incorrect outputs. The key realization was that each line should start with a descending sequence from `i` to `0` and then an ascending sequence from `1` to `i`.\n\n    Another issue was with the output formatting. The solution initially added extra newlines between test cases, which was not required. This was fixed by carefully managing the output to ensure that test cases are separated correctly without trailing newlines.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The final solution correctly implements the pattern generation by:\n    - Using nested loops to construct each line of the pattern.\n    - Ensuring the correct order of numbers for each line.\n    - Managing the output format to match the expected results without extra newlines.\n\n    Here is the corrected code snippet:\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for K in test_cases:\n            pattern = []\n            for i in range(K):\n                line = \"\"\n                # Append numbers from i down to 0\n                for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                    line += str(j)\n                # Append numbers from 1 up to i\n                for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                    line += str(j)\n                pattern.append(line)\n            results.append(\"\\n\".join(pattern))\n        # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases\n        print(\"\\n\\n\".join(results))\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\n    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and carefully managing output formatting in competitive programming problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It iterates over each element in the sequence, adding it to `current_sum`. After adding each element, it checks if `current_sum` is less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers. If it is, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop because it's impossible to adjust the sequence to sum to zero.\n\n- **Final Check**: After processing all elements, if `possible` is still `True` and `current_sum` is equal to the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers, it prints \"YES\".

This is because a single negative number cannot be adjusted to zero.\n\n2. **Sum of Positives vs. Negatives**: For sequences with more than one element, the solution calculates the sum of positive numbers (`p`) and the sum of negative numbers (`q`). The sequence can be made to sum to zero if the sum of positive numbers is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the sum of negative numbers. This is because the positive numbers can be decreased to offset the negative numbers.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the sequence to calculate the sums, making it O(N) per test case, which is optimal given the constraints.\n\n#### Why My Approach Failed:\n\n- **Complexity**: My approach involved unnecessary checks and calculations, such as trying to track cumulative sums and adjust them iteratively, which was not needed.\n- **Misinterpretation**: I misunderstood the operation's impact on the sequence, leading to incorrect logic for determining if the sequence could be made to sum to zero.\n\nIn summary, the official solution's simplicity and direct approach to comparing the sums of positive and negative elements provide a clear and efficient way to solve the problem. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and operations clearly before devising a solution."
