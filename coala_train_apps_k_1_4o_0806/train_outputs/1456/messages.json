Given N and an integer K, we need to find a permutation P such that f(P) equals K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation.

In this case, f(P) is the sum of the first N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1.\n\n        3. **Minimum Possible Value of f(P)**: The minimum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in ascending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the last N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N - 1) / 2).\n\n        4. **Feasibility Check**: If K is less than the minimum possible value or greater than the maximum possible value, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.\n\n        5. **Constructing the Permutation**: If K is feasible, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K.

For each pair, it calculates a result using another function and stores the result in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result from the list.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to compute a specific function over a range of integers, particularly when the function involves bitwise operations like XOR. The problem involves finding pairs of integers that satisfy certain conditions, which is a common task in combinatorial problems and cryptography. Understanding how to efficiently compute such functions over large ranges is crucial in competitive programming and algorithm design, especially when dealing with constraints that require optimization to handle large inputs within time limits. The solution also demonstrates how to handle multiple test cases efficiently, which is a common requirement in programming contests."
