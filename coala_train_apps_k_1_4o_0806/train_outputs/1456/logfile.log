INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to solve a problem involving XOR pair representation (XPR) of a number \( N \). For a given number \( N \), we need to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) such that:
- \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \)
- \( A \oplus B = N \)
- \( A \) is the smallest possible value that satisfies the above conditions.

If no such pair exists, \( A = B = -1 \). Otherwise, the function \( F(N) \) returns the value of \( B \) in the XPR of \( N \).

Given two integers \( L \) and \( R \), we need to compute the sum \( G(L, R) = \sum_{i=L}^R F(i) \).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR Properties**: 
   - XOR operation has a property that \( A \oplus A = 0 \) and \( A \oplus 0 = A \).
   - For \( A \oplus B = N \), we can derive \( B = A \oplus N \).

2. **Finding Valid Pairs**:
   - For each \( N \), iterate over possible values of \( A \) from 1 to \( N \).
   - Calculate \( B = A \oplus N \).
   - Check if \( A \leq B \leq N \). If true, this is a valid pair.

3. **Compute \( F(N) \)**:
   - For each \( N \), find the smallest \( A \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \) and \( 1 \leq A \leq B \leq N \).
   - If no such \( A \) exists, \( F(N) = -1 \).

4. **Compute \( G(L, R) \)**:
   - For each test case, compute the sum of \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

## Pseudocode

```
function F(N):
    for A from 1 to N:
        B = A XOR N
        if A <= B <= N:
            return B
    return -1

function G(L, R):
    sum = 0
    for i from L to R:
        sum += F(i)
    return sum

read T
for each test case:
    read L, R
    print G(L, R)
```

## Python Solution

```python
def F(N):
    # Iterate over possible values of A
    for A in range(1, N + 1):
        B = A ^ N  # Calculate B using XOR
        # Check if the pair (A, B) is valid
        if A <= B <= N:
            return B
    return -1  # If no valid pair is found

def G(L, R):
    total_sum = 0
    # Calculate the sum of F(i) for all i from L to R
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        total_sum += F(i)
    return total_sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(G(L, R))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# The main function will be called when the script is executed
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result for each one. The function `F(N)` finds the value of \( B \) for each \( N \), and `G(L, R)` computes the sum of these values over the range \([L, R]\).

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and a function f(P) that sums the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. Given N and an integer K, we need to find a permutation P such that f(P) equals K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this involves N-1 pairs.

        2. **Maximum Possible Value of f(P)**: The maximum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in descending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the first N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1.

        3. **Minimum Possible Value of f(P)**: The minimum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in ascending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the last N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N - 1) / 2).

        4. **Feasibility Check**: If K is less than the minimum possible value or greater than the maximum possible value, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.

        5. **Constructing the Permutation**: If K is feasible, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This involves swapping elements to reduce the sum from the maximum possible value to K.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, K = test_case
                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
                min_possible = (N * (N - 1) / 2)
        
                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
                    print -1
                else:
                    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
                    current_sum = max_possible
                    for i from 0 to N-2:
                        if current_sum == K:
                            break
                        if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1]) >= K:
                            current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1])
                            swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) for a given positive integer \( N \) such that:
- \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \)
- \( A \oplus B = N \)
- \( A \) is the smallest possible value that satisfies the above conditions.

If no such pair exists, \( A = B = -1 \). The function \( F(N) \) returns the value of \( B \) in the pair \( (A, B) \). We then define \( G(L, R) \) as the sum of \( F(i) \) for all integers \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \). Given multiple test cases, each with a range \( [L, R] \), we need to compute \( G(L, R) \) for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR**: The XOR operation has a property that for any two numbers \( A \) and \( B \), \( A \oplus B = N \) implies \( B = A \oplus N \).

2. **Finding \( A \) and \( B \)**:
   - For a given \( N \), iterate over possible values of \( A \) from 1 to \( N \).
   - Calculate \( B = A \oplus N \).
   - Check if \( A \le B \le N \). If true, this is a valid pair.
   - The first valid pair found will have the smallest \( A \).

3. **Function \( F(N) \)**:
   - If a valid pair \( (A, B) \) is found, \( F(N) = B \).
   - If no valid pair is found, \( F(N) = -1 \).

4. **Function \( G(L, R) \)**:
   - For each test case, compute \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \) and sum the results.

5. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Direct computation for each \( N \) in the range \( [L, R] \) is feasible due to the constraints, as each computation involves a simple loop up to \( N \).

## Pseudocode

```

    for A from 1 to N:
        B = A XOR N
        if A <= B <= N:

 ## Problem Restatement

We need to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) for a given positive integer \( N \) such that:
- \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \)
- \( A \oplus B = N \)
- \( A \) is the smallest possible value that satisfies the above conditions.

If no such pair exists, \( A = B = -1 \). The function \( F(N) \) returns the value of \( B \) in the pair \( (A, B) \). We then define \( G(L, R) \) as the sum of \( F(i) \) for all integers \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \). Given multiple test cases, each with a range \( [L, R] \), we need to compute \( G(L, R) \) for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR**: The XOR operation has a property that for any two numbers \( A \) and \( B \), \( A \oplus B = N \) implies \( B = A \oplus N \).

2. **Finding \( A \) and \( B \)**:
   - For a given \( N \), iterate over possible values of \( A \) from 1 to \( N \).
   - Calculate \( B = A \oplus N \).
   - Check if \( A \le B \le N \). If true, this is a valid pair.
   - The first valid pair found will have the smallest \( A \).

3. **Function \( F(N) \)**:
   - If a valid pair \( (A, B) \) is found, \( F(N) = B \).
   - If no valid pair is found, \( F(N) = -1 \).

4. **Function \( G(L, R) \)**:
   - For each test case, compute \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \) and sum the results.

5. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Direct computation for each \( N \) in the range \( [L, R] \) is feasible due to the constraints, as each computation involves a simple loop up to \( N \).

## Pseudocode

```
function compute_F(N):
    for A from 1 to N:
        B = A XOR N
        if A <= B <= N:
            return B
    return -1

    sum = 0

    read T

        read L, R
        result = compute_G(L, R)

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept revolves around understanding the properties of the XOR operation and how it can be used to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \). The challenge was to efficiently compute the function \( G(L, R) \) for multiple test cases, where \( G(L, R) \) is the sum of \( F(i) \) for all integers \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

The key insight was recognizing that for each \( N \), \( B \) can be computed as \( A \oplus N \), and the task is to find the smallest \( A \) such that \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \). This led to a straightforward approach of iterating over possible values of \( A \) and checking the conditions for \( B \).

The solution involved writing a helper function `compute_F(N)` to find \( B \) for each \( N \), and another function `compute_G(L, R)` to sum these values over a range. The main function handled input/output efficiently, which is crucial given the constraints.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding bitwise operations and their properties, as well as the need for efficient input/output handling in competitive programming scenarios. The solution was straightforward once the properties of XOR were leveraged correctly, and no unexpected errors were encountered.

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] The problem of finding the XOR pair representation (XPR) and computing the function \( G(L, R) \) was approached in a straightforward manner in my initial solution. However, the official solution provides a more efficient method, especially for large ranges, by leveraging mathematical insights rather than iterating through each number in the range.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Mathematical Approach**: The official solution uses a mathematical approach to compute the sum of \( F(i) \) for a range without explicitly iterating through each number. This is crucial for handling large ranges efficiently.

2. **Summation and Powers of Two**: The solution calculates the sum of numbers up to \( x \) using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. It then uses properties of powers of two to adjust this sum to account for the XOR operation.

3. **Efficient Range Calculation**: By defining a helper function `GLR(x)`, the solution computes the sum of \( F(i) \) from 1 to \( x \). For a range \( [L, R] \), it calculates \( G(L, R) \) as \( GLR(R) - GLR(L-1) \). This avoids recalculating from scratch for each test case, significantly improving efficiency.

4. **Logarithmic Adjustment**: The solution includes a logarithmic adjustment to account for the number of bits involved in the XOR operation, which is a clever way to handle the constraints of the problem.

### Reflection:

The official solution is insightful in its use of mathematical properties to optimize the computation of \( G(L, R) \). It highlights the importance of looking for patterns and mathematical shortcuts in problems involving operations like XOR, which can often be decomposed into simpler arithmetic operations. This approach is not only more efficient but also scales well with the problem's constraints, making it suitable for large inputs. In future problems, considering mathematical transformations and properties can lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.

[Problem]
    The XOR pair representation (XPR) of a positive integer $N$ is defined as a pair of integers $(A, B)$ such that:
    - $1 \le A \le B \le N$
    - $A \oplus B = N$
    - if there is no way to choose $A$ and $B$ satisfying the above conditions, $A = B = -1$
    - otherwise, the value of $A$ should be the smallest possible
    These conditions uniquely define the XPR. Next, we define a function $F(N)$ = the value of $B$ in $XPR(N)$, and a function $G(L, R) = \sum\limits_{i=L}^R F(i)$.
    You are given $L$ and $R$. Compute $G(L, R)$.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the value of the function $G(L, R)$.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
    - $1 \le L \le R \le 10^9$

    -----Example Input-----

    1 10
    3 6
    4 10
    10 17
    100 159
