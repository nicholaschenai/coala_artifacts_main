        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe have two students, Ram and Shyam, with roll numbers `A` and `B`. They can only cheat if they receive the same set of questions. The sets of questions are distributed based on the roll number modulo `p`, where `p` is the number of different sets. We need to determine how many values of `p` allow Ram and Shyam to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`. This implies that `A-1` and `B-1` must have the same remainder when divided by `p`.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `A - B = k * p`.\n\n3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The above equation implies that `p` must be a divisor of `|A - B|`. Therefore, the number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A - B|`.\n\n4. **Special Case**: If `A == B`, then `A - B = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to an infinite number of solutions. In this case, we return `-1`.\n\n5. **Iterating Over Test Cases**: For each test case, compute `|A - B|` and count its divisors to determine the number of valid `p` values.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return -1\n    count = 0\n    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            if i != n // i:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\nfunction solve(T, test_cases):\n    for each (A, B) in test_cases:\n        diff = abs(A - B)\n        result = count_divisors(diff)\n        print(result)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    # If n is zero, it means A and B are equal, leading to infinite solutions\n    if n == 0:\n        return -1\n    count = 0\n    # Check divisors up to the square root of n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            # If i is not the square root of n, count the complement divisor\n            if i != n // i:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        A = int(data[index])\n        B = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        diff = abs(A - B)\n        result = count_divisors(diff)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the number of valid `p` values for each case. If `A` equals `B`, it outputs `-1` to indicate infinite solutions."

This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.\n\n    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.\n\n    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.\n\n    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The key insight is that they can cheat if `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`, which simplifies to finding the divisors of `|A-B|`.\n\n### Key Insights and Learnings:\n\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: The condition `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` simplifies to `(A-B) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This means `p` must be a divisor of `|A-B|`.\n\n2. **Handling Special Cases**: If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions. This is handled by checking if `A` and `B` are equal and returning `-1`.\n\n3. **Efficient Divisor Counting**: Both my solution and the official solution efficiently count divisors by iterating up to the square root of `|A-B|`. This reduces the time complexity significantly compared to iterating through all numbers up to `|A-B|`.\n\n4. **Function Call**: A simple oversight in my initial solution was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output.

Specifically, it applies to situations where you have two distinct identifiers (like roll numbers) and you want to find out how many different group sizes (or sets) would allow these identifiers to fall into the same group. This is particularly relevant in competitive programming, cryptography, or any field that involves modular arithmetic and divisibility, such as scheduling problems, resource allocation, or network design where entities need to be grouped based on certain conditions."
