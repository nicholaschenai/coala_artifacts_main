[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have two students, Ram and Shyam, with roll numbers `A` and `B`. They can only cheat if they receive the same set of questions. The sets of questions are distributed based on the roll number modulo `p`, where `p` is the number of different sets. We need to determine how many values of `p` allow Ram and Shyam to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`. This implies that `A-1` and `B-1` must have the same remainder when divided by `p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `A - B = k * p`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The above equation implies that `p` must be a divisor of `|A - B|`. Therefore, the number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A - B|`.

4. **Special Case**: If `A == B`, then `A - B = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to an infinite number of solutions. In this case, we return `-1`.

5. **Iterating Over Test Cases**: For each test case, compute `|A - B|` and count its divisors to determine the number of valid `p` values.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_divisors(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve(T, test_cases):
    for each (A, B) in test_cases:
        diff = abs(A - B)
        result = count_divisors(diff)
        print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_divisors(n):
    # If n is zero, it means A and B are equal, leading to infinite solutions
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    # Check divisors up to the square root of n
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            # If i is not the square root of n, count the complement divisor
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        result = count_divisors(diff)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the number of valid `p` values for each case. If `A` equals `B`, it outputs `-1` to indicate infinite solutions.

        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

        1. **Reading Input**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach, but we need to ensure that the input is being processed correctly.

        2. **Output**: The code appends results to a list and then writes them all at once using `sys.stdout.write()`. This should work, but we need to ensure that the results are being computed and stored correctly.

        3. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is likely the reason why no output is being produced. The function needs to be called to execute the logic.

        4. **Logic and Computation**: The logic for computing the number of subsets seems correct based on the problem statement. However, we need to ensure that the precomputation of factorials and inverses is correct and that the binomial coefficient and power of two calculations are accurate.

        5. **Edge Cases**: We should ensure that edge cases, such as when \(K > I\), are handled correctly by returning 0.

        Let's fix the issue by ensuring the `solve()` function is called and verify the logic step-by-step.

        Here's the corrected code:

        ```python
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
            factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverse_factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    
            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD
    
            inverse_factorial[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD - 2, MOD)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverse_factorial[i] = inverse_factorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD
    
            return factorial, inverse_factorial

            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % MOD * inverse_factorial[n - k] % MOD

        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])

                index += 2
        
                for _ in range(Q):
                    I = int(data[index])
                    K = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        binom = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorial, inverse_factorial)
                        power_of_two = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = binom * power_of_two % MOD
                        results.append(result)

        # Call the solve function to execute the solution
        solve()
        ```

        ### Key Fixes:
        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
        - **Verification**: Double-checked the logic for computing binomial coefficients and powers of two to ensure correctness.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions. Each student receives a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers of Ram (`A`) and Shyam (`B`), we need to determine how many values of `p` allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This implies that `(A-1) % p` and `(B-1) % p` must be equal.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) = k * p`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|`.

### Pseudocode

```
function countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1

    return count

 ### Problem Restatement

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions. Each student receives a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers of Ram (`A`) and Shyam (`B`), we need to determine how many values of `p` allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This implies that `(A-1) % p` and `(B-1) % p` must be equal.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) = k * p`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|`.

### Pseudocode

```
function countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

    read T
    for each test case:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

-----Example Input-----

Each student receives a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers of Ram (`A`) and Shyam (`B`), we need to determine how many values of `p` allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This implies that `(A-1) % p` and `(B-1) % p` must be equal.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) = k * p`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.

   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|`.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called after its definition. In Python, functions need to be explicitly called to execute their logic. 

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called after its definition so that it executes and processes the input.

2. **Input Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments. Ensure that the input is being read correctly and processed.

3. **Output**: Ensure that the results are being printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Corrected Solution

Let's make sure to call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure it executes and processes the input as expected.

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        
        if diff == 0:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the solution
solve()
```

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script, ensuring that the logic is executed.
- **Input and Output**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, and results are stored in a list and printed after processing all test cases. This ensures that the output is correctly formatted and displayed.

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script, ensuring that the logic is executed.
- **Input and Output**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, and results are stored in a list and printed after processing all test cases. This ensures that the output is correctly formatted and displayed.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Prefix Sum Optimization**: My approach used a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.

    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.

    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.

    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions. Each student receives a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers of Ram (`A`) and Shyam (`B`), we need to determine how many values of `p` allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This implies that `(A-1) % p` and `(B-1) % p` must be equal.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) = k * p`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|`.

### Pseudocode

```
function countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read A, B
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            print -1
        else:
            print countDivisors(diff)
```

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called after its definition. In Python, functions need to be explicitly called to execute their logic. 

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called after its definition so that it executes and processes the input.

2. **Input Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments. Ensure that the input is being read correctly and processed.

3. **Output**: Ensure that the results are being printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Corrected Solution

Let's make sure to call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure it executes and processes the input as expected.

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        
        if diff == 0:
            results.append(-1)

    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the solution

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

### Key Insights:
- **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
- **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

### Strategies:
- **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
- **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

### Code Snippet:
```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions. Each student receives a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers of Ram (`A`) and Shyam (`B`), we need to determine how many values of `p` allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This implies that `(A-1) % p` and `(B-1) % p` must be equal.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) = k * p`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|`.

### Pseudocode

```
function countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read A, B
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            print -1
        else:
            print countDivisors(diff)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        
        if diff == 0:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called after its definition. In Python, functions need to be explicitly called to execute their logic. 

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called after its definition so that it executes and processes the input.

2. **Input Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments. Ensure that the input is being read correctly and processed.

3. **Output**: Ensure that the results are being printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Corrected Solution

Let's make sure to call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure it executes and processes the input as expected.

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        
        if diff == 0:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the solution
solve()
```

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script, ensuring that the logic is executed.
- **Input and Output**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, and results are stored in a list and printed after processing all test cases. This ensures that the output is correctly formatted and displayed.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of `p` allow Ram and Shyam to receive the same set of questions based on their roll numbers. The key insight is that they can cheat if `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`, which simplifies to finding the divisors of `|A-B|`.

### Key Insights and Learnings:

1. **Understanding the Condition**: The condition `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` simplifies to `(A-B) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This means `p` must be a divisor of `|A-B|`.

2. **Handling Special Cases**: If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions. This is handled by checking if `A` and `B` are equal and returning `-1`.

3. **Efficient Divisor Counting**: Both my solution and the official solution efficiently count divisors by iterating up to the square root of `|A-B|`. This reduces the time complexity significantly compared to iterating through all numbers up to `|A-B|`.

4. **Function Call**: A simple oversight in my initial solution was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output. This highlights the importance of ensuring that all parts of the code are executed as intended.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical conditions and efficiently counting divisors, which are common tasks in competitive programming. The official solution was similar in approach, confirming the correctness of the logic used.

[Problem]
    Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
    - The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
    - If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
    Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
    You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 100$
    - $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$
