    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, and we need to find the largest possible \"good\" subtree. A \"good\" subtree is a connected subgraph of the tree that can be represented by intersecting one-dimensional segments. We need to answer multiple queries, each providing a different tree, and for each query, we need to output the size of the largest good subtree.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. For a subtree to be \"good\", it should be possible to represent it using intersecting segments.\n\n2. **Good Subtree Characteristics**: A good subtree can be represented by segments if it is connected and has a structure that allows for intersections. The largest good subtree will be the one that includes the maximum number of vertices while maintaining this property.\n\n3. **Finding the Largest Good Subtree**: \n   - The largest good subtree in a tree is the entire tree minus one vertex. This is because in a tree, removing any single vertex still leaves a connected graph (a forest of trees).\n   - Therefore, for a tree with `n` vertices, the largest good subtree will have `n-1` vertices.\n\n4. **Handling Multiple Queries**: For each query, simply output `n-1`, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree for that query.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_largest_good_subtree(q, queries):\n    results = []\n    for each query in queries:\n        n = query.number_of_vertices\n        results.append(n - 1)\n    return results\n\nread q from input\nqueries = []\nfor i from 1 to q:\n    read n from input\n    read n-1 edges from input (ignore them)\n    queries.append(n)\nresults = find_largest_good_subtree(q, queries)\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_good_subtree(q, queries):\n    # For each query, the largest good subtree size is n - 1\n    results = []\n    for n in queries:\n        results.append(n - 1)\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    q = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(q):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        # Skip the next n-1 lines of edges\n        index += (n - 1) * 2\n        queries.append(n)\n    \n    results = find_largest_good_subtree(q, queries)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. We parse the number of queries `q` and then for each query, we read `n` and skip the `n-1` edges since they are not needed for the solution.\n- **Logic**: For each tree with `n` vertices, the largest good subtree has `n-1` vertices.\n- **Output**: We print the result for each query.",
