The expression may include:\n- Non-negative integers\n- The plus `+` and minus `-` operators\n- Parentheses `(` and `)`\n- Spaces, which should be ignored\n\nThe expression is always valid, and we cannot use Python's `eval` function.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a stack to handle the parentheses and maintain the current result and sign. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**: \n   - A stack to keep track of results and signs when encountering parentheses.\n   - A variable `result` to store the current result.\n   - A variable `sign` to store the current sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n   - A variable `i` to iterate through the string.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String**:\n   - If the character is a digit, parse the full number and update the result using the current sign.\n   - If the character is a `+`, set the sign to 1.\n   - If the character is a `-`, set the sign to -1.\n   - If the character is `(`, push the current result and sign onto the stack, then reset `result` to 0 and `sign` to 1.\n   - If the character is `)`, pop the sign and previous result from the stack, and update the current result accordingly.\n   - Ignore spaces.\n\n3. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters, the `result` will contain the evaluated value of the expression.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate(s):\n    initialize stack as empty\n    initialize result as 0\n    initialize sign as 1\n    initialize i as 0\n\n    while i < length of s:\n        if s[i] is a digit:\n            initialize num as 0\n            while i < length of s and s[i] is a digit:\n                num = num * 10 + int(s[i])\n                increment i\n            decrement i\n            result += sign * num\n        else if s[i] is '+':\n            sign = 1\n        else if s[i] is '-':\n            sign = -1\n        else if s[i] is '(':\n            push result onto stack\n            push sign onto stack\n            result = 0\n            sign = 1\n        else if s[i] is ')':\n            pop sign from stack\n            pop previous_result from stack\n            result = previous_result + sign * result\n        increment i\n\n    return result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize a stack to handle parentheses\n        stack = []\n        # Initialize the current result and sign\n        result = 0\n        sign = 1\n        i = 0\n        \n        while i < len(s):\n            char = s[i]\n            \n            if char.isdigit():\n                # If the character is a digit, parse the full number\n                num = 0\n                while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():\n                    num = num * 10 + int(s[i])\n                    i += 1\n                # Adjust for the last increment in the loop\n                i -= 1\n                # Update the result with the current number and sign\n                result += sign * num\n            \n            elif char == '+':\n                # Set the sign to positive\n                sign = 1\n            \n            elif char == '-':\n                # Set the sign to negative\n                sign = -1\n            \n            elif char == '(':\n                # Push the current result and sign onto the stack\n                stack.append(result)\n                stack.append(sign)\n                # Reset result and sign for the new sub-expression\n                result = 0\n                sign = 1\n            \n            elif char == ')':\n                # Pop the sign and previous result from the stack\n                prev_sign = stack.pop()\n                prev_result = stack.pop()\n                # Update the result with the evaluated sub-expression\n                result = prev_result + prev_sign * result\n            \n            # Move to the next character\n            i += 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n"

st.pop();\n        int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n        switch (op) {\n            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;\n            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;\n            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;\n            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int evaluate(string& s) {\n        stack<int> st;\n        stack<char> op;\n        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {\n            if (delim(s[i]))\n                continue;\n        \n            if (s[i] == '(') {\n                op.push('(');\n            } else if (s[i] == ')') {\n                while (op.top() != '(') {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.pop();\n            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {\n                char cur_op = s[i];\n                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.push(cur_op);\n            } else {\n                int number = 0;\n                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))\n                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';\n                --i;\n                st.push(number);\n            }\n        }\n\n        while (!op.empty()) {\n            process_op(st, op.top());\n            op.pop();\n        }\n        return st.top();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.\n    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.\n\n    ## Unary operators\n\n    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).\n    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.\n\n    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.\n\n    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).\n    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.\n    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. \n\n    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.\n    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.\n\n    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.\n\n    ## Right-associativity\n\n    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.\n\n    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.\n    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \\wedge b \\wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).\n\n    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?\n    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.\n    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.\n\n    The only line that needs to be replaced is\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))\n    ```\n    with\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && (\n            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||\n            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))\n        ))\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "The problem of evaluating a simple mathematical expression string was straightforward, and my initial approach closely aligned with the official solution. Both solutions utilized a stack to handle parentheses and maintain the correct order of operations, and both iterated through the string character by character to build numbers and apply operations.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n- The use of `ord(c) - ord('0')` to convert a character to its integer value is a neat trick that avoids using `int(c)`. This is a minor optimization but can be useful in environments where performance is critical.\n- The official solution resets the `sign` to `1` after processing a closing parenthesis, which is a good practice to ensure that the sign is correctly initialized for any subsequent operations.\n- The final check `if num:` before adding the last number to the result ensures that any remaining number is added to the result, which is a good safeguard against missing the last number in the expression.\n\nOverall, the problem was a good exercise in using stacks to manage nested operations and ensuring that all parts of the expression are evaluated correctly. The official solution confirmed the effectiveness of the stack-based approach and provided a few minor optimizations that could be useful in similar problems."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThe function evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string, which may include integers, addition, subtraction, and parentheses. It uses a stack to handle nested expressions within parentheses, storing the current result and sign before entering a new sub-expression. As it iterates through the string, it constructs numbers from consecutive digits and applies the current sign to update the result when encountering '+' or '-' operators. When encountering '(', it saves the current state and resets for the sub-expression, and upon encountering ')', it finalizes the sub-expression result and combines it with the saved state. Finally, it adds any remaining number to the result and returns the computed integer value.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to evaluate mathematical expressions programmatically without using built-in functions like eval, which can be unsafe if the input is not controlled. This is particularly relevant in developing calculators, parsers, or interpreters for custom scripting languages where expressions need to be evaluated. Understanding how to handle operator precedence, parentheses, and maintaining state with a stack is crucial in these scenarios. Additionally, this approach can be adapted to handle more complex expressions involving multiplication, division, or other operators by extending the logic."
