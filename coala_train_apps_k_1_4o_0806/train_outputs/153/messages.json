        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem is to determine if a given list of matchstick lengths can be used to form a square. Each matchstick must be used exactly once, and you cannot break any matchstick. The goal is to see if you can arrange the matchsticks such that they form a square with equal side lengths.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Check Total Length**: First, calculate the total length of all matchsticks. If this total is not divisible by 4, it's impossible to form a square, so return `False`.\n\n2. **Determine Side Length**: If the total length is divisible by 4, then each side of the square must be equal to `total_length / 4`.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking approach to try and form the square. Start by sorting the matchsticks in descending order to optimize the process (larger sticks are harder to place, so try them first).\n\n4. **Recursive Function**: Create a recursive function that attempts to place each matchstick into one of the four sides. If a matchstick can fit into a side without exceeding the target side length, place it there and move to the next matchstick.\n\n5. **Base Case**: If all matchsticks are placed successfully, return `True`. If you cannot place a matchstick in any side without exceeding the target length, backtrack and try a different configuration.\n\n6. **Pruning**: If at any point a side becomes exactly equal to the target side length, move to the next side.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction makesquare(nums):\n    if nums is empty or sum(nums) % 4 != 0:\n        return False\n    \n    target_side_length = sum(nums) / 4\n    sort nums in descending order\n    \n    initialize sides as [0, 0, 0, 0]\n    \n    function canFormSquare(index):\n        if index == length of nums:\n            return all sides are equal to target_side_length\n        \n        for each side in sides:\n            if side + nums[index] <= target_side_length:\n                add nums[index] to side\n                if canFormSquare(index + 1):\n                    return True\n                remove nums[index] from side\n            if side is 0:\n                break\n        \n        return False\n    \n    return canFormSquare(0)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def makesquare(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        # If there are no matchsticks, we cannot form a square\n        if not nums:\n            return False\n        \n        # Calculate the total length of all matchsticks\n        total_length = sum(nums)\n        \n        # If the total length is not divisible by 4, we cannot form a square\n        if total_length % 4 != 0:\n            return False\n        \n        # Each side of the square must be of this length\n        target_side_length = total_length // 4\n        \n        # Sort the matchsticks in descending order\n        nums.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        # Initialize the four sides of the square\n        sides = [0] * 4\n        \n        # Helper function to attempt to form the square\n        def canFormSquare(index):\n            # If we've placed all matchsticks, check if all sides are equal to target\n            if index == len(nums):\n                return all(side == target_side_length for side in sides)\n            \n            # Try to place the current matchstick in each side\n            for i in range(4):\n                if sides[i] + nums[index] <= target_side_length:\n                    sides[i] += nums[index]\n                    if canFormSquare(index + 1):\n                        return True\n                    sides[i] -= nums[index]\n                \n                # If a side is 0, no need to try other sides as they are also 0\n                if sides[i] == 0:\n                    break\n            \n            return False\n        \n        # Start the recursive backtracking from the first matchstick\n        return canFormSquare(0)\n```\n\nThis solution uses a backtracking approach to try and fit each matchstick into one of the four sides of the square, ensuring that each side does not exceed the target side length.

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.\n\n    #### Key Insights and Strategies\n\n    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.\n\n    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N = test_case[0]\n            A = test_case[1]\n        \n            current_sum = 0\n            possible = True\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                current_sum += A[i]\n                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n        \n            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is an alternative to the recursive backtracking method and can be more efficient in terms of stack depth, especially in environments with limited recursion depth.\n\n2. **State Representation**: The state in the stack is represented by a tuple containing:\n   - `usedIndexSet`: A set of indices of matchsticks that have been used.\n   - `searchStartFromIndex`: The index from which to start searching for the next matchstick.\n   - `target`: The remaining length needed to complete the current side.\n   - `remainRounds`: The number of sides left to complete.\n\n3. **Early Exit Conditions**: The solution includes checks to quickly exit if the largest matchstick is greater than the target side length or if the total length is not divisible by 4.\n\n4. **Efficient Search**: By sorting the matchsticks in descending order, the solution attempts to fit larger matchsticks first, which can lead to faster pruning of invalid paths.\n\n5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases such as when the number of matchsticks is less than 4 or when the largest matchstick is equal to the target side length.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution's use of an iterative stack-based approach is a valuable alternative to recursive backtracking, especially in scenarios where recursion depth might be a concern. The explicit management of state using a stack can also make the algorithm easier to follow and debug. This experience highlights the importance of considering both recursive and iterative approaches when tackling combinatorial problems, as each has its own advantages and trade-offs."
