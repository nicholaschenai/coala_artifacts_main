This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.\nThe railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.\nThe Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.\nThe minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!\nIn other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.\nFor example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:\n$ $\nStation              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 \nExpected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 \n\n$ $\nIf the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$.\n- $-10^9 \\leq p_i \\leq 10^9$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \\leq N \\leq 4000$\n- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n8\n-20\n90\n-30\n-20\n80\n-70\n-60\n125\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n-5\n6 8\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of their profit/loss values is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of all profits/losses from the start up to station `i`. This allows us to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.\n\n2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we need to find two prefix sums that are closest to each other. The difference between these two prefix sums will give us the sum of the subarray between them.\n\n3. **Sorting for Efficiency**: By sorting the prefix sums, we can efficiently find the two closest sums. The difference between these two sums will be minimized, and we can determine the indices of the subarray by their original positions.\n\n4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, we choose the longest one. This can be naturally handled by checking the length of the subarray when we find two prefix sums with the same difference.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a prefix sum array with the first element as zero.\n2. Iterate through the profits/losses and fill the prefix sum array.\n3. Pair each prefix sum with its index and sort these pairs.\n4. Initialize variables to track the minimum difference and the best indices.\n5. Iterate through the sorted prefix sums:\n   - Calculate the difference between consecutive prefix sums.\n   - If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum and the indices.\n   - If the difference is the same but the subarray is longer, update the indices.\n6. Output the minimum difference and the indices of the best subarray.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_best_segment(N, profits):\n    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums\n    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]\n    \n    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort\n    indexed_prefix_sums = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]\n    indexed_prefix_sums.sort()\n    \n    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the best segment\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_start = 0\n    best_end = 0\n    \n    # Step 4: Find the closest pair of prefix sums\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        current_diff = abs(indexed_prefix_sums[i][0] - indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][0])\n        start_index = min(indexed_prefix_sums[i][1], indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][1])\n        end_index = max(indexed_prefix_sums[i][1], indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][1]) - 1\n        \n        # Check if we found a better segment\n        if current_diff < min_diff or (current_diff == min_diff and (end_index - start_index) > (best_end - best_start)):\n            min_diff = current_diff\n            best_start = start_index\n            best_end = end_index\n    \n    # Step 5: Output the result\n    print(min_diff)\n    print(best_start + 1, best_end + 1)\n\n# Example usage:\n# N = 8\n# profits = [-20, 90, -30, -20, 80, -70, -60, 125]\n# find_best_segment(N, profits)\n```\n\nThis code efficiently finds the segment with the sum closest to zero by leveraging prefix sums and sorting, ensuring it runs in O(N log N) time, which is suitable for the given constraints."

This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.\n\n    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.\n\n    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.\n\n    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using prefix sums and sorting. The key is to leverage the properties of prefix sums to quickly compute subarray sums and find the one closest to zero.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\n1. **Initial Approach**: The initial approach involved calculating prefix sums and iterating over all previous sums to find the closest to zero. This was inefficient and incorrect for large inputs due to the nested iteration over prefix sums.\n\n2. **Sorting Prefix Sums**: A more efficient strategy involved sorting the prefix sums and comparing consecutive differences. This approach reduces the problem to finding the smallest difference between sorted prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray with the sum closest to zero.\n\n3. **Handling Indices**: A persistent challenge was correctly handling the indices to ensure the output was in the required 1-based format. The logic needed to correctly track the start and end of the segment in the original list.\n\n#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n- **Incorrect Segment Calculation**: The main error was in calculating the segment indices. The solution needed to ensure that the indices reflected the actual segment in the original list, not just the difference between prefix sums.\n- **Output Format**: Ensuring the output was in the correct 1-based index format was crucial. Adjustments were made to the indices to meet this requirement.\n\n#### Final Solution\nThe final solution involved:\n- Calculating prefix sums and storing them with their indices.\n- Sorting the prefix sums to efficiently find the closest sums.\n- Iterating over sorted prefix sums to find the segment with the sum closest to zero, while ensuring the longest segment is chosen if there are ties.\n- Correctly outputting the minimum sum and the 1-based indices of the segment.\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of efficient data structures and careful handling of indices in problems involving subarrays and prefix sums."

However, the official solution uses a more sophisticated method by maintaining a sorted list of prefix sums and using binary search to find the closest sums. This is a more efficient way to handle the problem, especially given the constraints.\n\n2. **Binary Search with Bisect**: The official solution uses the `bisect` module to maintain a sorted list of prefix sums. This allows for efficient insertion and searching, which is crucial for handling large inputs. My approach did not leverage this, leading to inefficiencies.\n\n3. **Handling Indices**: The official solution carefully tracks indices using a separate list (`idx`) to ensure that the correct segment is identified. This is a critical step that was not handled correctly in my solution, leading to incorrect segment identification.\n\n4. **Checking Conditions**: The official solution uses a helper function `check` to encapsulate the logic for updating the best segment. This modular approach makes the code cleaner and ensures that all conditions are checked consistently.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: The official solution handles edge cases by checking both the previous and next possible prefix sums, ensuring that the closest sum to zero is found. This is a robust approach that my solution lacked.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient and robust, particularly in its use of binary search and careful handling of indices.
