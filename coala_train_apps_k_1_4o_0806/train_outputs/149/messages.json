Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. The goal is to return the final string after all possible removals have been made.\n\n## Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We can use a stack to help us keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string.\n   - For each character in the string, we check if it matches the character at the top of the stack.\n   - If it matches, we increment the count of that character.\n   - If the count reaches `k`, we remove that character from the stack.\n   - If it doesn't match, we push the new character onto the stack with a count of 1.\n   - After processing all characters, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty stack\n   For each character in the string:\n       If the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack has the same character:\n           Increment the count of the top element\n           If the count equals k:\n               Pop the top element from the stack\n       Else:\n           Push the character with count 1 onto the stack\n   Initialize an empty result string\n   For each element in the stack:\n       Append the character repeated by its count to the result string\n   Return the result string\n   ```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n        stack = []\n        \n        # Iterate over each character in the string\n        for char in s:\n            # If the stack is not empty and the top element has the same character\n            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                # Increment the count of the top element\n                stack[-1][1] += 1\n                # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack\n                if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                    stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # Push the new character with count 1 onto the stack\n                stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n        # Initialize an empty result string\n        result = ''\n        # Reconstruct the string from the stack\n        for char, count in stack:\n            result += char * count\n        \n        # Return the final result string\n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently processes the string in a single pass, using a stack to manage the characters and their counts, ensuring that we can handle the constraints of the problem effectively."

Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.\n\n\n        You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.\n\n        Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].\n\n\n        Examples:\n\n        s = \"3[a]2[bc]\", return \"aaabcbc\".\n        s = \"3[a2[c]]\", return \"accaccacc\".\n        s = \"2[abc]3[cd]ef\", return \"abcabccdcdcdef\".\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n           We are given a string that is encoded using a specific pattern. The pattern involves numbers followed by square brackets containing a substring. The number indicates how many times the substring inside the brackets should be repeated. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns and returning the fully decoded string.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the current state as we parse through the string. We will iterate over each character in the string:\n           - If we encounter a digit, we will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.\n           - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it indicates the start of a new encoded substring, so we push the current state (current string and repeat count) onto the stack.\n           - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded substring. We pop the last state from the stack, repeat the substring the specified number of times, and append it to the previous string.\n           - If we encounter a letter, we simply append it to the current string being built.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function decodeString(s):\n               Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and repeat counts\n               Initialize current_string as an empty string\n               Initialize current_num as 0\n\n               for each character in s:\n                   if character is a digit:\n                       Update current_num to include this digit\n                   else if character is '[':\n                       Push (current_string, current_num) onto the stack\n                       Reset current_string to empty and current_num to 0\n                   else if character is ']':\n                       Pop (prev_string, repeat_count) from the stack\n                       Update current_string to prev_string + (current_string repeated repeat_count times)\n                   else:\n                       Append character to current_string\n\n               return current_string\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n                # Initialize a stack to keep track of previous strings and repeat counts\n                stack = []\n                current_string = \"\"\n                current_num = 0\n\n                # Iterate over each character in the input string\n                for char in s:\n                    if char.isdigit():\n                        # If the character is a digit, update the current number\n                        current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)\n                    elif char == '[':\n                        # If the character is '[', push the current state onto the stack\n                        stack.append((current_string, current_num))\n                        # Reset current_string and current_num for the new context\n                        current_string = \"\"\n                        current_num = 0\n                    elif char == ']':\n                        # If the character is ']', pop the last state from the stack\n                        prev_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                        # Repeat the current_string and append it to the previous string\n                        current_string = prev_string + current_string * repeat_count\n                    else:\n                        # If the character is a letter, append it to the current string\n                        current_string += char\n\n                # Return the fully decoded string\n                return current_string\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses a stack to manage nested structures and handles multiple digits for repeat counts, ensuring the correct decoding of the input string.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['\"3[a]2[bc]\"'] Output: \"aaabcbc\"\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

The solution leveraged a stack to keep track of characters and their counts, which is a common pattern for problems involving removal of adjacent duplicates.\n\nThe strategy that worked was to iterate through the string and use the stack to manage character counts. For each character, if it matched the top of the stack, the count was incremented. If the count reached `k`, the character was removed from the stack.

The key insight is to use the stack to keep track of characters and their counts, allowing us to efficiently manage the removal of duplicates.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Stack Utilization**: Both solutions use a stack to store pairs of characters and their counts. This allows us to efficiently check and update the count of consecutive characters as we iterate through the string.\n\n2. **Handling Duplicates**: When a character matches the top of the stack, we increment the count. If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack, effectively removing the duplicates from the string.\n\n3. **Reconstruction of the Result**: After processing the string, the stack contains the characters and their remaining counts. We reconstruct the final string by repeating each character according to its count.\n\n### Differences and Similarities:\n\n- **Initialization**: The official solution initializes the stack with a dummy element `['*', 0]` to simplify the logic of checking the stack's top element. This avoids the need to check if the stack is empty before accessing its top element. My solution starts with an empty stack and includes a check for emptiness.\n\n- **Efficiency**: Both solutions operate in linear time relative to the length of the string, which is optimal for this problem. The space complexity is also efficient, as the stack only grows with unique sequences of characters.\n\nOverall, the official solution is slightly more elegant due to the use of a dummy element, which simplifies the logic. However, both approaches are fundamentally similar and effective in solving the problem. This exercise reinforced the utility of stacks in managing sequences and conditions efficiently."
