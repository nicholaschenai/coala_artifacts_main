## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
Example 2:
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
Example 3:
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
2 <= k <= 10^4
s only contains lower case English letters.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        
```

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. The goal is to return the final string after all possible removals have been made.

## Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We can use a stack to help us keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string.
   - For each character in the string, we check if it matches the character at the top of the stack.
   - If it matches, we increment the count of that character.
   - If the count reaches `k`, we remove that character from the stack.
   - If it doesn't match, we push the new character onto the stack with a count of 1.
   - After processing all characters, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.

## Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   For each character in the string:
       If the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack has the same character:
           Increment the count of the top element
           If the count equals k:
               Pop the top element from the stack
       Else:
           Push the character with count 1 onto the stack
   Initialize an empty result string
   For each element in the stack:
       Append the character repeated by its count to the result string
   Return the result string
   ```

## Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts
        stack = []
        
        # Iterate over each character in the string
        for char in s:
            # If the stack is not empty and the top element has the same character
            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                # Increment the count of the top element
                stack[-1][1] += 1
                # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack
                if stack[-1][1] == k:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                # Push the new character with count 1 onto the stack
                stack.append([char, 1])
        
        # Initialize an empty result string
        result = ''
        # Reconstruct the string from the stack
        for char, count in stack:
            result += char * count
        
        # Return the final result string
        return result
```

This solution efficiently processes the string in a single pass, using a stack to manage the characters and their counts, ensuring that we can handle the constraints of the problem effectively.

        Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


        The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


        You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

        Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


        Examples:

        s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
        s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
        s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a string that is encoded using a specific pattern. The pattern involves numbers followed by square brackets containing a substring. The number indicates how many times the substring inside the brackets should be repeated. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns and returning the fully decoded string.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the current state as we parse through the string. We will iterate over each character in the string:
           - If we encounter a digit, we will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.
           - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it indicates the start of a new encoded substring, so we push the current state (current string and repeat count) onto the stack.
           - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded substring. We pop the last state from the stack, repeat the substring the specified number of times, and append it to the previous string.
           - If we encounter a letter, we simply append it to the current string being built.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function decodeString(s):
               Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and repeat counts
               Initialize current_string as an empty string
               Initialize current_num as 0

               for each character in s:
                   if character is a digit:
                       Update current_num to include this digit
                   else if character is '[':
                       Push (current_string, current_num) onto the stack
                       Reset current_string to empty and current_num to 0
                   else if character is ']':
                       Pop (prev_string, repeat_count) from the stack
                       Update current_string to prev_string + (current_string repeated repeat_count times)
                   else:
                       Append character to current_string

               return current_string

   We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string. For each character in the string:
   - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.
   - If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack.
   - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.
   - Finally, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function removeDuplicates(s, k):
       Initialize an empty stack
       
       for each character in s:
           if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:
               Increment the count of the top element in the stack
               if count equals k:
                   Pop the top element from the stack
           else:
               Push (character, 1) onto the stack
       
       Initialize result as an empty string
       for each (character, count) in stack:
           Append character repeated count times to result
       
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python

    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently remove sequences of `k` adjacent and identical characters from a string until no more such sequences exist. The solution leveraged a stack to keep track of characters and their counts, which is a common pattern for problems involving removal of adjacent duplicates.

The strategy that worked was to iterate through the string and use the stack to manage character counts. For each character, if it matched the top of the stack, the count was incremented. If the count reached `k`, the character was removed from the stack. If the character was different, it was added to the stack with a count of 1. This approach ensured that the solution operated in linear time, which is efficient given the constraints.

No unexpected errors were encountered, as the stack-based approach is well-suited for this type of problem. The key takeaway is the utility of stacks in managing sequences and counts, especially when dealing with problems that require removal of adjacent duplicates. This pattern can be applied to similar problems in the future.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string. For each character in the string:
   - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.
   - If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack.
   - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.
   - Finally, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function removeDuplicates(s, k):
       Initialize an empty stack
       
       for each character in s:
           if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:
               Increment the count of the top element in the stack
               if count equals k:
                   Pop the top element from the stack
           else:
               Push (character, 1) onto the stack
       
       Initialize result as an empty string
       for each (character, count) in stack:
           Append character repeated count times to result
       
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The problem of removing `k` adjacent duplicates from a string was effectively solved using a stack-based approach, both in my solution and the official solution. The key insight is to use the stack to keep track of characters and their counts, allowing us to efficiently manage the removal of duplicates.

### Key Insights:

1. **Stack Utilization**: Both solutions use a stack to store pairs of characters and their counts. This allows us to efficiently check and update the count of consecutive characters as we iterate through the string.

2. **Handling Duplicates**: When a character matches the top of the stack, we increment the count. If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack, effectively removing the duplicates from the string.

3. **Reconstruction of the Result**: After processing the string, the stack contains the characters and their remaining counts. We reconstruct the final string by repeating each character according to its count.

### Differences and Similarities:

- **Initialization**: The official solution initializes the stack with a dummy element `['*', 0]` to simplify the logic of checking the stack's top element. This avoids the need to check if the stack is empty before accessing its top element. My solution starts with an empty stack and includes a check for emptiness.

- **Efficiency**: Both solutions operate in linear time relative to the length of the string, which is optimal for this problem. The space complexity is also efficient, as the stack only grows with unique sequences of characters.

Overall, the official solution is slightly more elegant due to the use of a dummy element, which simplifies the logic. However, both approaches are fundamentally similar and effective in solving the problem. This exercise reinforced the utility of stacks in managing sequences and conditions efficiently.

It is particularly applicable in text processing tasks where duplicate or repetitive sequences need to be identified and removed, such as data cleaning, text normalization, or compression algorithms. The approach of using a stack to keep track of characters and their counts is a common technique in problems involving sequence removal or pattern matching, making it a valuable strategy in competitive programming and algorithm design.",
