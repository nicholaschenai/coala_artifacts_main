    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string. For each character in the string:\n   - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.\n   - If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack.\n   - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.\n   - Finally, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function removeDuplicates(s, k):\n       Initialize an empty stack\n       \n       for each character in s:\n           if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:\n               Increment the count of the top element in the stack\n               if count equals k:\n                   Pop the top element from the stack\n           else:\n               Push (character, 1) onto the stack\n       \n       Initialize result as an empty string\n       for each (character, count) in stack:\n           Append character repeated count times to result\n       \n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n        stack = []\n        \n        # Iterate over each character in the string\n        for char in s:\n            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character\n                stack[-1][1] += 1  # Increment the count of the top element\n                if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                    # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack\n                    stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # If the stack is empty or the top character is different, push the current character with count 1\n                stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n        # Reconstruct the result string from the stack\n        result = ''\n        for char, count in stack:\n            result += char * count  # Append the character repeated 'count' times\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently manages the removal of `k` adjacent duplicates using a stack, ensuring that the operations are performed in linear time relative to the length of the string.",
