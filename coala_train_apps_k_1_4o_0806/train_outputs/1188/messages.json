He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.\nChef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.\nThere are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.\nNow, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains one integer N.\nNext line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri \u2014 the person whom the ith member reports to.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a list of space-separated integers in ascending order \u2014 the indices of potential killers.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 Ri \u2264 N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.\n- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask #1 [50 points]: N \u2264 10000\n- Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n6\n0 1 1 2 2 3\n\nOutput:\n4 5 6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe reporting structure:\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom a particular member reports. Our task is to identify all the \"minor criminals,\" which are members that no one reports to. These members are potential killers. We need to output their indices in ascending order.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Don**: The Don is the only member who reports to no one, indicated by a 0 in the list.\n2. **Track Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.\n3. **Identify Minor Criminals**: A minor criminal is a member who is not in the set of reported members.\n4. **Output**: Collect all such minor criminals and output their indices in ascending order.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the integer `N` (number of members).\n2. Read the list `R` of size `N` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom member `i+1` reports.\n3. Initialize an empty set `reported_to`.\n4. Iterate over each `Ri` in `R`:\n   - If `Ri` is not 0, add `Ri` to the `reported_to` set.\n5. Initialize an empty list `minor_criminals`.\n6. Iterate over indices from 1 to `N`:\n   - If the index is not in `reported_to`, add it to `minor_criminals`.\n7. Sort `minor_criminals`.\n8. Print the sorted list of `minor_criminals`.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n    \n    # Set to track members who are reported to\n    reported_to = set()\n    \n    # Fill the set with members who are reported to\n    for Ri in R:\n        if Ri != 0:\n            reported_to.add(Ri)\n    \n    # List to store potential killers (minor criminals)\n    minor_criminals = []\n    \n    # Check each member if they are not reported to\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if i not in reported_to:\n            minor_criminals.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the list of minor criminals\n    minor_criminals.sort()\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, minor_criminals)))\n\n```\n\nThis code reads input, processes the reporting structure to identify members who are not reported to by anyone, and outputs their indices in ascending order."

But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.\n        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall.

This is a common problem when the function `solve()` is defined but not called, or when the input/output is not handled correctly.\n\n        2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be called explicitly to execute the logic.\n\n        3. **Output**: The output is expected to be printed, but the feedback indicates that no output was detected. This suggests that the function might not be executed at all.\n\n        ### Steps to Fix\n\n        1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the logic is executed.\n\n        2. **Check Input/Output**: Verify that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.\n\n        3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Although the logic seems correct, ensure that the binary search and set operations are functioning as intended.\n\n        ### Revised Code\n\n        Let's make sure the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly:\n\n        ```python\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n    \n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                Q = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n        \n                a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    x_j = int(data[index])\n                    y_j = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                    if sum_xy in a_set:\n                        results.append(-1)\n                    else:\n                        # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                        low, high = 0, N\n                        while low < high:\n                            mid = (low + high) // 2\n                            if a[mid] > sum_xy:\n                                high = mid\n                            else:\n                                low = mid + 1\n                        results.append(N - low)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.\n        - **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.\n        - **Logic**: The logic remains the same, using a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n    \n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                Q = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n        \n                a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    x_j = int(data[index])\n                    y_j = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                    if sum_xy in a_set:\n                        results.append(-1)\n                    else:\n                        # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                        low, high = 0, N\n                        while low < high:\n                            mid = (low + high) // 2\n                            if a[mid] > sum_xy:\n                                high = mid\n                            else:\n                                low = mid + 1\n                        results.append(N - low)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.\n        - **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.\n        - **Logic**: The logic uses a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.

But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.\n        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.\n        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.\n        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.\n        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.\n        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $1 \\leq T \\leq 2 * 10^2$\n        - $1 \\leq N, Q \\leq 2 * 10^5$\n        - $1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$\n        - $0 \\leq x_j, y_j \\leq 10^9$\n        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$\n        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$\n\n        -----Sample Input-----\n        1\n        2\n        1 3\n        5\n        0 0\n        2 0\n        0 4\n        1 1\n        1 2\n\n        -----Sample Output-----\n        0\n        1\n        2\n        1\n        -1\n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:\n\n        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.\n\n        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.\n\n        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.\n\n        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.\n\n        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        Let's analyze the code and the feedback to identify the issue:\n\n        ### Problem Analysis\n\n        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from or writing to standard IO. This is a common problem when the function `solve()` is defined but not called, or when the input/output is not handled correctly.\n\n        2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be called explicitly to execute the logic.\n\n        3. **Output**: The output is expected to be printed, but the feedback indicates that no output was detected. This suggests that the function might not be executed at all.\n\n        ### Steps to Fix\n\n        1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the logic is executed.\n\n        2. **Check Input/Output**: Verify that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.\n\n        3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Although the logic seems correct, ensure that the binary search and set operations are functioning as intended.\n\n        ### Revised Code\n\n        Let's make sure the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly:\n\n        ```python\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n    \n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                Q = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n        \n                a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    x_j = int(data[index])\n                    y_j = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                    if sum_xy in a_set:\n                        results.append(-1)\n                    else:\n                        # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                        low, high = 0, N\n                        while low < high:\n                            mid = (low + high) // 2\n                            if a[mid] > sum_xy:\n                                high = mid\n                            else:\n                                low = mid + 1\n                        results.append(N - low)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.\n        - **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.\n        - **Logic**: The logic remains the same, using a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n    \n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                Q = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n        \n                a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    x_j = int(data[index])\n                    y_j = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                    if sum_xy in a_set:\n                        results.append(-1)\n                    else:\n                        # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                        low, high = 0, N\n                        while low < high:\n                            mid = (low + high) // 2\n                            if a[mid] > sum_xy:\n                                high = mid\n                            else:\n                                low = mid + 1\n                        results.append(N - low)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.\n        - **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.\n        - **Logic**: The logic uses a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.

The key concept was to find members who are not reported to by anyone, as these are the potential killers. The problem tested the ability to process input data, use sets for efficient membership checking, and handle input/output in a competitive programming context.\n\nInitially, the solution correctly identified potential killers by iterating through the list of reports and using a set to track members who are reported to. However, the solution failed to pass tests because it did not handle input and output correctly. The function was defined but not called with actual input, and the results were not printed to standard output.\n\nThe fix involved reading input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`, parsing the input data, and then calling the function with this data. The output was then printed as a space-separated string of integers. This adjustment ensured the solution worked in an automated testing environment.\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of correctly handling input and output in programming contests and similar environments. It also reinforced the utility of sets for efficient membership checking when dealing with problems involving unique elements."

This approach is straightforward and efficient, leveraging the properties of sets for quick membership checks.\n\n3. **Official Solution:**\n   - The official solution constructs a dictionary to represent the reporting structure as a tree. Each member is a key, and the value is a list of members who report to them. It then identifies members with empty lists (i.e., no one reports to them) as potential killers.\n   - This approach is insightful as it explicitly models the hierarchy, which could be useful for more complex queries about the structure. However, it might be slightly more complex in terms of implementation compared to using a set.\n\n4. **Comparison and Insights:**\n   - Both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides a more explicit representation of the hierarchy, which could be beneficial for understanding the structure or extending the problem.\n   - My approach is simpler and directly addresses the problem requirements without additional data structures, which is efficient for this specific task.\n\n5. **Takeaways:**\n   - When dealing with hierarchical data, consider both direct approaches (like using sets) and more structured approaches (like using dictionaries to model trees) depending on the problem's complexity and potential extensions.\n   - Always ensure that input/output handling is correctly implemented, especially in competitive programming environments where this is a common source of errors."

        "content": "\n[description for function: findPotentialKillers]\nThe function identifies potential killers in a group of members based on their reporting structure. It takes the total number of members and a list of reports, where each member reports to another member or the Don (indicated by 0). It creates a set of members who are reported to and then checks each member to see if they are not in this set, indicating they are not reported to by anyone. These members are considered potential killers. The function then sorts this list of potential killers in ascending order and returns it.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to identify elements in a hierarchical structure that do not have any dependencies or connections pointing to them. This is common in organizational structures, dependency graphs, and network analysis. For instance, in a corporate setting, identifying employees who do not have any subordinates can help in understanding the organizational hierarchy. In software dependency graphs, finding packages or modules that are not depended upon by others can help in identifying unused or isolated components. This problem also applies to social network analysis, where identifying individuals who are not followed by anyone can provide insights into network dynamics."
