    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia has a hierarchical structure with one Don at the top who reports to no one. Each member reports to exactly one other member. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom the corresponding member reports. Our task is to find all members who are not reported to by anyone, as these are the potential killers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, identify all members who are reported to by others. This can be done by iterating through the list of reports and marking each reported member.\n   - Then, identify members who are not in the list of reported members. These members are the potential killers.\n   - Finally, output the indices of these potential killers in ascending order.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function findPotentialKillers(N, reports):\n       create a set called reported_to to keep track of members who are reported to\n       \n       for each member i from 1 to N:\n           if reports[i] is not 0:\n               add reports[i] to reported_to\n       \n       create a list called potential_killers\n       \n       for each member i from 1 to N:\n           if i is not in reported_to:\n               add i to potential_killers\n       \n       sort potential_killers in ascending order\n       \n       return potential_killers\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef findPotentialKillers(N, reports):\n    # Create a set to track members who are reported to\n    reported_to = set()\n    \n    # Iterate over each member's report\n    for i in range(N):\n        # If the member reports to someone (not the Don)\n        if reports[i] != 0:\n            # Add the reported member to the set\n            reported_to.add(reports[i])\n    \n    # List to store potential killers\n    potential_killers = []\n    \n    # Check each member to see if they are not reported to\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if i not in reported_to:\n            # If not reported to, add to potential killers\n            potential_killers.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the potential killers in ascending order\n    potential_killers.sort()\n    \n    # Return the list of potential killers\n    return potential_killers\n\n# Example usage:\n# N = 6\n# reports = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n# print(findPotentialKillers(N, reports))  # Output: [4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `findPotentialKillers` that takes the number of members `N` and a list `reports` indicating who each member reports to. It identifies and returns a sorted list of members who are not reported to by anyone, which are the potential killers.",
