## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

-----Subtasks-----

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a mafia organization with a hierarchical structure. Each member reports to exactly one other member, except for the Don, who reports to no one. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom a particular member reports. Our task is to identify all the "minor criminals," which are members that no one reports to. These members are potential killers. We need to output their indices in ascending order.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Don**: The Don is the only member who reports to no one, indicated by a 0 in the list.
2. **Track Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.
3. **Identify Minor Criminals**: A minor criminal is a member who is not in the set of reported members.
4. **Output**: Collect all such minor criminals and output their indices in ascending order.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the integer `N` (number of members).
2. Read the list `R` of size `N` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom member `i+1` reports.
3. Initialize an empty set `reported_to`.
4. Iterate over each `Ri` in `R`:
   - If `Ri` is not 0, add `Ri` to the `reported_to` set.
5. Initialize an empty list `minor_criminals`.
6. Iterate over indices from 1 to `N`:
   - If the index is not in `reported_to`, add it to `minor_criminals`.
7. Sort `minor_criminals`.
8. Print the sorted list of `minor_criminals`.

### Python Code

```python
def find_potential_killers():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    # Set to track members who are reported to
    reported_to = set()
    
    # Fill the set with members who are reported to
    for Ri in R:
        if Ri != 0:
            reported_to.add(Ri)
    
    # List to store potential killers (minor criminals)
    minor_criminals = []
    
    # Check each member if they are not reported to
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to:
            minor_criminals.append(i)
    
    # Sort the list of minor criminals
    minor_criminals.sort()
    
    # Print the result
    print(" ".join(map(str, minor_criminals)))

```

This code reads input, processes the reporting structure to identify members who are not reported to by anyone, and outputs their indices in ascending order.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case.

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        -----Sample Input-----
        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the code and the feedback to identify the issue:

        ### Problem Analysis

        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from or writing to standard IO. This is a common problem when the function `solve()` is defined but not called, or when the input/output is not handled correctly.

        2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be called explicitly to execute the logic.

        3. **Output**: The output is expected to be printed, but the feedback indicates that no output was detected. This suggests that the function might not be executed at all.

        ### Steps to Fix

        1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the logic is executed.

        2. **Check Input/Output**: Verify that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

        3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Although the logic seems correct, ensure that the binary search and set operations are functioning as intended.

        ### Revised Code

        Let's make sure the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly:

        ```python
        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
    
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                index += 1
                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
                index += N
                Q = int(data[index])
                index += 1
        
                a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall
        
                for _ in range(Q):
                    x_j = int(data[index])
                    y_j = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
                    if sum_xy in a_set:
                        results.append(-1)
                    else:
                        # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                        low, high = 0, N
                        while low < high:
                            mid = (low + high) // 2
                            if a[mid] > sum_xy:
                                high = mid
                            else:
                                low = mid + 1
                        results.append(N - low)
    
            sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

        # Call the solve function to execute the logic
        solve()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
        - **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.
        - **Logic**: The logic remains the same, using a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia has a hierarchical structure with one Don at the top who reports to no one. Each member reports to exactly one other member. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom the corresponding member reports. Our task is to find all members who are not reported to by anyone, as these are the potential killers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, identify all members who are reported to by others. This can be done by iterating through the list of reports and marking each reported member.
   - Then, identify members who are not in the list of reported members. These members are the potential killers.
   - Finally, output the indices of these potential killers in ascending order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function findPotentialKillers(N, reports):
       create a set called reported_to to keep track of members who are reported to
       
       for each member i from 1 to N:
           if reports[i] is not 0:
               add reports[i] to reported_to
       
       create a list called potential_killers
       
       for each member i from 1 to N:
           if i is not in reported_to:
               add i to potential_killers
       
       sort potential_killers in ascending order
       
       return potential_killers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def findPotentialKillers(N, reports):
    # Create a set to track members who are reported to
    reported_to = set()
    
    # Iterate over each member's report
    for i in range(N):
        # If the member reports to someone (not the Don)
        if reports[i] != 0:
            # Add the reported member to the set
            reported_to.add(reports[i])
    
    # List to store potential killers
    potential_killers = []
    
    # Check each member to see if they are not reported to
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to:
            # If not reported to, add to potential killers
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers in ascending order

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia has a hierarchical structure with one Don at the top who reports to no one. Each member reports to exactly one other member. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom the corresponding member reports. Our task is to find all members who are not reported to by anyone, as these are the potential killers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, identify all members who are reported to by others. This can be done by iterating through the list of reports and marking each reported member.
   - Then, identify members who are not in the list of reported members. These members are the potential killers.
   - Finally, output the indices of these potential killers in ascending order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function findPotentialKillers(N, reports):
       create a set called reported_to to keep track of members who are reported to
       
       for each member i from 1 to N:
           if reports[i] is not 0:
               add reports[i] to reported_to
       
       create a list called potential_killers
       
       for each member i from 1 to N:
           if i is not in reported_to:
               add i to potential_killers

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of two lines: the first line is an integer `N`, the number of members, and the second line is a space-separated list of integers representing the reporting structure.
   - The output should be a space-separated list of indices of potential killers in ascending order.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The function `findPotentialKillers` is designed to take `N` and `reports` as arguments and return a list of potential killers.
   - The function correctly identifies members who are not reported to by anyone and returns them in sorted order.

3. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The problem seems to be with how the input is being read and how the output is being printed.
   - The function `findPotentialKillers` is defined but not called with actual input from standard input.
   - The output is not being printed to standard output.

4. **Correcting the Mistake:**
   - We need to read the input from standard input, call the function with this input, and then print the result to standard output.

Let's fix the code by adding the necessary input/output handling:

```python
def findPotentialKillers(N, reports):
    # Create a set to track members who are reported to
    reported_to = set()
    
    # Iterate over each member's report
    for i in range(N):
        # If the member reports to someone (not the Don)
        if reports[i] != 0:
            # Add the reported member to the set
            reported_to.add(reports[i])
    
    # List to store potential killers
    potential_killers = []
    
    # Check each member to see if they are not reported to
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to:
            # If not reported to, add to potential killers
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers in ascending order
    potential_killers.sort()
    
    # Return the list of potential killers
    return potential_killers

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# First line is the number of members
N = int(data[0])

# Second line is the list of reports
reports = list(map(int, data[1:]))

# Get the list of potential killers
potential_killers = findPotentialKillers(N, reports)

# Print the result as space-separated integers
print(" ".join(map(str, potential_killers)))
```

This code now includes reading from standard input and printing to standard output, which should resolve the issue with the test environment.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        -----Sample Input-----
        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the code and the feedback to identify the issue:

        ### Problem Analysis

        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from or writing to standard IO. This is a common problem when the function `solve()` is defined but not called, or when the input/output is not handled correctly.

        2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be called explicitly to execute the logic.

        3. **Output**: The output is expected to be printed, but the feedback indicates that no output was detected. This suggests that the function might not be executed at all.

        ### Steps to Fix

        1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the logic is executed.

        2. **Check Input/Output**: Verify that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

        3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Although the logic seems correct, ensure that the binary search and set operations are functioning as intended.

        ### Revised Code

        Let's make sure the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly:

        ```python
        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
    
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                index += 1
                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
                index += N
                Q = int(data[index])
                index += 1
        
                a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall
        
                for _ in range(Q):
                    x_j = int(data[index])
                    y_j = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
                    if sum_xy in a_set:
                        results.append(-1)
                    else:
                        # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                        low, high = 0, N
                        while low < high:
                            mid = (low + high) // 2
                            if a[mid] > sum_xy:
                                high = mid
                            else:
                                low = mid + 1
                        results.append(N - low)
    
            sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

        # Call the solve function to execute the logic
        solve()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
        - **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.
        - **Logic**: The logic remains the same, using a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask #1 [50 points]: N â‰¤ 10000

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] 
## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia has a hierarchical structure with one Don at the top who reports to no one. Each member reports to exactly one other member. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom the corresponding member reports. Our task is to find all members who are not reported to by anyone, as these are the potential killers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, identify all members who are reported to by others. This can be done by iterating through the list of reports and marking each reported member.
   - Then, identify members who are not in the list of reported members. These members are the potential killers.
   - Finally, output the indices of these potential killers in ascending order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function findPotentialKillers(N, reports):
       create a set called reported_to to keep track of members who are reported to
       
       for each member i from 1 to N:

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of two lines: the first line is an integer `N`, the number of members, and the second line is a space-separated list of integers representing the reporting structure.
   - The output should be a space-separated list of indices of potential killers in ascending order.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The function `findPotentialKillers` is designed to take `N` and `reports` as arguments and return a list of potential killers.
   - The function correctly identifies members who are not reported to by anyone and returns them in sorted order.

3. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The problem seems to be with how the input is being read and how the output is being printed.
   - The function `findPotentialKillers` is defined but not called with actual input from standard input.
   - The output is not being printed to standard output.

4. **Correcting the Mistake:**
   - We need to read the input from standard input, call the function with this input, and then print the result to standard output.

Let's fix the code by adding the necessary input/output handling:

# Get the list of potential killers
potential_killers = findPotentialKillers(N, reports)

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to identify potential killers in a mafia organization based on a hierarchical reporting structure. The key concept was to find members who are not reported to by anyone, as these are the potential killers. The problem tested the ability to process input data, use sets for efficient membership checking, and handle input/output in a competitive programming context.

Initially, the solution correctly identified potential killers by iterating through the list of reports and using a set to track members who are reported to. However, the solution failed to pass tests because it did not handle input and output correctly. The function was defined but not called with actual input, and the results were not printed to standard output.

The fix involved reading input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`, parsing the input data, and then calling the function with this data. The output was then printed as a space-separated string of integers. This adjustment ensured the solution worked in an automated testing environment.

This experience highlighted the importance of correctly handling input and output in programming contests and similar environments. It also reinforced the utility of sets for efficient membership checking when dealing with problems involving unique elements.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia has a hierarchical structure with one Don at the top who reports to no one. Each member reports to exactly one other member. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom the corresponding member reports. Our task is to find all members who are not reported to by anyone, as these are the potential killers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, identify all members who are reported to by others. This can be done by iterating through the list of reports and marking each reported member.
   - Then, identify members who are not in the list of reported members. These members are the potential killers.
   - Finally, output the indices of these potential killers in ascending order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function findPotentialKillers(N, reports):
       create a set called reported_to to keep track of members who are reported to
       
       for each member i from 1 to N:
           if reports[i] is not 0:
               add reports[i] to reported_to
       
       create a list called potential_killers
       
       for each member i from 1 to N:
           if i is not in reported_to:
               add i to potential_killers
       
       sort potential_killers in ascending order
       
       return potential_killers

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task was to identify members of a mafia organization who are not reported to by anyone, based on a given reporting structure. These members are potential killers.

2. **My Approach:**
   - I used a set to track members who are reported to and then identified members who are not in this set. This approach is straightforward and efficient, leveraging the properties of sets for quick membership checks.

3. **Official Solution:**
   - The official solution constructs a dictionary to represent the reporting structure as a tree. Each member is a key, and the value is a list of members who report to them. It then identifies members with empty lists (i.e., no one reports to them) as potential killers.
   - This approach is insightful as it explicitly models the hierarchy, which could be useful for more complex queries about the structure. However, it might be slightly more complex in terms of implementation compared to using a set.

4. **Comparison and Insights:**
   - Both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides a more explicit representation of the hierarchy, which could be beneficial for understanding the structure or extending the problem.
   - My approach is simpler and directly addresses the problem requirements without additional data structures, which is efficient for this specific task.

5. **Takeaways:**
   - When dealing with hierarchical data, consider both direct approaches (like using sets) and more structured approaches (like using dictionaries to model trees) depending on the problem's complexity and potential extensions.
   - Always ensure that input/output handling is correctly implemented, especially in competitive programming environments where this is a common source of errors.

These members are considered potential killers. The function then sorts this list of potential killers in ascending order and returns it.

[Problem]
    Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
    Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
    There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
    Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

    -----Input-----
    The first line of input contains one integer N.
    Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

    -----Output-----
    Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
    - 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
    - It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

    -----Subtasks-----
    - Subtask #1 [50 points]: N â‰¤ 10000
    - Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    6
    0 1 1 2 2 3

    Output:
    4 5 6

    -----Explanation-----
