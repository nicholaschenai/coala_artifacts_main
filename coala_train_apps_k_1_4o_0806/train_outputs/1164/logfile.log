## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on the number of subtasks where the number of contestants solving it decreases as the score increases. The difficulty of a problem is represented as a pair of integers, where the first integer is the count of such subtasks and the second is the problem's index. We need to sort the problems by difficulty, first by the count of decreasing subtasks and then by the problem index if counts are equal.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each problem, pair the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
2. Sort these pairs by score to ensure the subtasks are in increasing order of score.
3. Count the number of times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.
4. Store the difficulty as a tuple of this count and the problem index.
5. Sort all problems by their difficulty tuples.
6. Output the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    for i from 0 to P-1:
        scores = problems[2*i]
        contestants = problems[2*i + 1]
        subtask_pairs = zip(scores, contestants)
        sorted_subtasks = sort(subtask_pairs by score)
        count_decreasing = 0
        for j from 0 to S-2:
            if sorted_subtasks[j][1] > sorted_subtasks[j+1][1]:
                count_decreasing += 1
        difficulties.append((count_decreasing, i+1))
    sort difficulties by (count_decreasing, index)
    return indices from sorted difficulties

read P, S
read problems as list of lists
result = calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems)
for each index in result:
    print index
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    
    for i in range(P):
        scores = problems[2 * i]
        contestants = problems[2 * i + 1]
        
        # Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
        subtask_pairs = list(zip(scores, contestants))
        subtask_pairs.sort()  # Sort by score automatically
        
        # Count the number of decreasing contestant numbers
        count_decreasing = 0
        for j in range(S - 1):
            if subtask_pairs[j][1] > subtask_pairs[j + 1][1]:
                count_decreasing += 1
        
        # Store the difficulty as a tuple (count_decreasing, problem_index)
        difficulties.append((count_decreasing, i + 1))
    
    # Sort difficulties by (count_decreasing, problem_index)
    difficulties.sort()
    
    # Extract and return the sorted problem indices
    return [index for _, index in difficulties]

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

P = int(data[0])
S = int(data[1])

problems = []
index = 2
for _ in range(2 * P):
    problems.append(list(map(int, data[index:index + S])))
    index += S

# Calculate and print the result
result = calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems)
for index in result:
    print(index)
```

This solution reads input, processes each problem to determine its difficulty, sorts the problems by difficulty, and outputs the indices in the required order.

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a contest with multiple problems, each containing several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is determined by counting how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We need to sort the problems by their difficulty, where a problem is considered more difficult if it has more such decreases, or if the number of decreases is the same, the problem with the higher index is considered more difficult.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of problems `P` and the number of subtasks `S`. For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.

2. **Calculate Difficulty**: For each problem, sort the subtasks by score. Count the number of times the number of contestants decreases as the score increases.

3. **Sort Problems**: Sort the problems based on the difficulty measure `(n, i)`, where `n` is the number of decreases and `i` is the problem index.

4. **Output**: Print the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_difficulty(problems):
    difficulties = []
    for each problem in problems:
        sort subtasks by score
        count decreases in number of contestants
        store (count, index) in difficulties
    sort difficulties by (count, index)
    return sorted indices

read P, S
initialize problems list
for i from 1 to P:
    read scores
    read number of contestants
    add (scores, contestants) to problems
sorted_indices = calculate_difficulty(problems)
for index in sorted_indices:
    print index
```

### Python Code

```python
def calculate_difficulty(problems):
    difficulties = []
    for index, (scores, contestants) in enumerate(problems):
        # Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
        paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))
        # Extract the sorted contestants based on sorted scores
        sorted_contestants = [c for _, c in paired]
        
        # Count the number of decreases
        decrease_count = 0
        for j in range(len(sorted_contestants) - 1):
            if sorted_contestants[j] > sorted_contestants[j + 1]:
                decrease_count += 1
        
        # Store the difficulty as a tuple (decrease_count, index)
        difficulties.append((decrease_count, index + 1))
    
    # Sort by decrease_count, and by index in case of ties
    difficulties.sort()
    
    # Extract the sorted indices
    sorted_indices = [index for _, index in difficulties]
    return sorted_indices

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    P = int(data[0])
    S = int(data[1])
    
    problems = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(P):
        scores = list(map(int, data[index:index + S]))
        contestants = list(map(int, data[index + S:index + 2 * S]))
        problems.append((scores, contestants))

    sorted_indices = calculate_difficulty(problems)
    for idx in sorted_indices:
        print(idx)

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to determine the difficulty of problems based on the number of decreases in the number of contestants solving subtasks as the score increases. The challenge was to correctly sort the problems based on this difficulty measure.

The strategy that worked involved:
1. Parsing the input to extract scores and contestant numbers for each problem.
2. Sorting the subtasks of each problem by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers.
3. Using a tuple `(decrease_count, index)` to represent the difficulty, which allowed for easy sorting of problems by difficulty and index.

A key insight was recognizing that sorting the subtasks by score simplifies the process of counting decreases in contestant numbers. This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially with the number of problems being as large as 100,000.

The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into these steps, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt. This problem reinforced the importance of sorting and tuple-based sorting for handling complex sorting criteria.

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

 final_list += sorted(scores[val])

for val in final_list :
 print(val)


INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights:

1. **Data Structures**: The official solution uses a dictionary to map scores to the number of contestants, which is a neat way to handle the association between scores and contestants. This approach is similar to my use of `zip` to pair scores and contestants, but the dictionary provides direct access to the number of contestants for a given score.

2. **Sorting and Counting**: Both solutions involve sorting the scores and counting the number of decreases in the number of contestants. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to compare consecutive elements, which is a clean and efficient way to count decreases.

3. **Handling Ties**: The official solution uses a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score and then sorts these groups. This is an effective way to handle ties, ensuring that problems with the same difficulty are sorted by their indices.

4. **Output**: The official solution constructs a final list of problem indices by iterating over sorted difficulty scores and their associated problem indices. This approach is clear and ensures the correct order of output.

Overall, both solutions are similar in logic and efficiency. The official solution's use of dictionaries for grouping and sorting is a useful technique for handling ties and organizing data, which can be applied to similar problems in the future.

    Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
    The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
    - Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
    - Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
    - Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
    - For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
    You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

    -----Output-----
    Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le P \le 100,000$
    - $2 \le S \le 30$
    - $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
    - $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
    - in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
    Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

    -----Example Input-----
