The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.\n    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.\n    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countDivisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        i = 1\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n            i += 1\n        return count\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            A = int(data[index])\n            B = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            diff = abs(A - B)\n        \n            if diff == 0:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                results.append(countDivisors(diff))\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This approach is similar to my use of `zip` to pair scores and contestants, but the dictionary provides direct access to the number of contestants for a given score.\n\n2. **Sorting and Counting**: Both solutions involve sorting the scores and counting the number of decreases in the number of contestants. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to compare consecutive elements, which is a clean and efficient way to count decreases.\n\n3. **Handling Ties**: The official solution uses a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score and then sorts these groups. This is an effective way to handle ties, ensuring that problems with the same difficulty are sorted by their indices.\n\n4. **Output**: The official solution constructs a final list of problem indices by iterating over sorted difficulty scores and their associated problem indices. This approach is clear and ensures the correct order of output.\n\nOverall, both solutions are similar in logic and efficiency.

It processes this data to create a list of problems, where each problem consists of a pair of lists: scores and corresponding contestant identifiers. It then calls another function to calculate the difficulty of each problem based on the number of decreases in contestant identifiers when sorted by scores. Finally, it prints the indices of the problems sorted by their calculated difficulty.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to rank or sort items based on a custom difficulty metric that involves multiple attributes. Specifically, it applies to situations where you have a set of tasks or problems, each with multiple components or subtasks, and you need to determine the difficulty based on the performance of participants on these subtasks. The method of sorting by a pair of values, where the primary value is a count of certain conditions (like decreases in performance) and the secondary value is an identifier, is a common pattern in competitive programming and algorithm design. This approach can be adapted to other contexts where a similar ranking or sorting mechanism is needed, such as evaluating project complexity, prioritizing tasks, or analyzing performance metrics."
