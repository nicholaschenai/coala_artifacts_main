    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was to determine the difficulty of problems based on the number of decreases in the number of contestants solving subtasks as the score increases. The challenge was to correctly sort the problems based on this difficulty measure.\n\nThe strategy that worked involved:\n1. Parsing the input to extract scores and contestant numbers for each problem.\n2. Sorting the subtasks of each problem by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers.\n3. Using a tuple `(decrease_count, index)` to represent the difficulty, which allowed for easy sorting of problems by difficulty and index.\n\nA key insight was recognizing that sorting the subtasks by score simplifies the process of counting decreases in contestant numbers. This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially with the number of problems being as large as 100,000.\n\nThe solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into these steps, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt. This problem reinforced the importance of sorting and tuple-based sorting for handling complex sorting criteria.",
    "reflection": "The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights:\n\n1. **Data Structures**: The official solution uses a dictionary to map scores to the number of contestants, which is a neat way to handle the association between scores and contestants. This approach is similar to my use of `zip` to pair scores and contestants, but the dictionary provides direct access to the number of contestants for a given score.\n\n2. **Sorting and Counting**: Both solutions involve sorting the scores and counting the number of decreases in the number of contestants. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to compare consecutive elements, which is a clean and efficient way to count decreases.\n\n3. **Handling Ties**: The official solution uses a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score and then sorts these groups. This is an effective way to handle ties, ensuring that problems with the same difficulty are sorted by their indices.\n\n4. **Output**: The official solution constructs a final list of problem indices by iterating over sorted difficulty scores and their associated problem indices. This approach is clear and ensures the correct order of output.\n\nOverall, both solutions are similar in logic and efficiency. The official solution's use of dictionaries for grouping and sorting is a useful technique for handling ties and organizing data, which can be applied to similar problems in the future.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes the number of problems and the number of scores per problem, followed by the scores and contestant identifiers for each problem. It processes this data to create a list of problems, where each problem consists of a pair of lists: scores and corresponding contestant identifiers. It then calls another function to calculate the difficulty of each problem based on the number of decreases in contestant identifiers when sorted by scores. Finally, it prints the indices of the problems sorted by their calculated difficulty.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to rank or sort items based on a custom difficulty metric that involves multiple attributes. Specifically, it applies to situations where you have a set of tasks or problems, each with multiple components or subtasks, and you need to determine the difficulty based on the performance of participants on these subtasks. The method of sorting by a pair of values, where the primary value is a count of certain conditions (like decreases in performance) and the secondary value is an identifier, is a common pattern in competitive programming and algorithm design. This approach can be adapted to other contexts where a similar ranking or sorting mechanism is needed, such as evaluating project complexity, prioritizing tasks, or analyzing performance metrics."
