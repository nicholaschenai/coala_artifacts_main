He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.\nMr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.\nEg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5\nOnly Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.\nEach room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.\n- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.\n- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.\n\n-----Output:-----\nMaximum money obtained.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5\n- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4\n- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100\n- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 1\n3\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n12\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nFor the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. \nThis is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each room is initially locked, and only the two rooms at the ends can be unlocked first. He has a limited number of keys, and each key can unlock one room. Once a room is unlocked, he can unlock its adjacent rooms. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect using the given number of keys.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initial Access**: Mr. Krabs can start unlocking from either the leftmost or the rightmost room.\n2. **Unlocking Strategy**: After unlocking a room, he can only unlock its adjacent rooms.\n3. **Maximizing Money**: To maximize the money, Mr. Krabs should choose the sequence of rooms that yields the highest sum of money with the given number of keys.\n4. **Sliding Window Approach**: Use a sliding window technique to evaluate the maximum sum of money that can be collected by unlocking a contiguous sequence of rooms starting from either end.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize `max_money` to 0.\n2. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the left end.\n3. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the right end.\n4. Use a sliding window to adjust the sum by moving one room from the left end to the right end:\n   - For each possible split of keys between the left and right ends:\n     - Calculate the sum of money by taking some rooms from the left and the rest from the right.\n     - Update `max_money` if the current sum is greater.\n5. Output `max_money`.\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_money(n, A, k):\n    # Initialize the maximum money to 0\n    max_money = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the left\n    left_sum = sum(A[:k])\n    max_money = max(max_money, left_sum)\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the right\n    right_sum = sum(A[-k:])\n    max_money = max(max_money, right_sum)\n    \n    # Use a sliding window to calculate the maximum money obtainable\n    # by taking some rooms from the left and the rest from the right\n    current_left_sum = 0\n    current_right_sum = sum(A[-k:])\n    \n    for i in range(k):\n        current_left_sum += A[i]\n        current_right_sum -= A[n - k + i]\n        current_sum = current_left_sum + current_right_sum\n        max_money = max(max_money, current_sum)\n    \n    return max_money\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nn = int(data[0])\nA = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\nk = int(data[n+1])\n\n# Output the result\nprint(max_money(n, A, k))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We first calculate the sum of the first `k` rooms from both the left and right ends.\n- We then use a sliding window approach to adjust the sum by moving one room from the left end to the right end, updating the maximum sum found.\n- The function `max_money` returns the maximum sum of money that can be collected with the given number of keys."

These chocolates have the following prices: 1, 12, 5, 10.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        ## Analysis of the Issue\n\n        The code logic itself is correct, but the issue arises from the way input and output are handled. The problem statement specifies that the solution should read from standard input and write to standard output, which is typical for competitive programming environments. The current implementation defines a function but does not handle input/output directly.\n\n        ## Steps to Correct the Solution\n\n        1. **Input Handling**: Read the input directly from standard input. This involves reading the number of chocolates, the budget, and the list of prices.\n        2. **Output Handling**: Print the result directly to standard output.\n        3. **Function Call**: Ensure that the function is called with the appropriate arguments derived from the input.\n\n        ## Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n            # Sort the prices in ascending order\n            prices.sort()\n    \n            # Initialize the count of chocolates and the total money spent\n            count = 0\n            total_spent = 0\n    \n            # Iterate over the sorted prices\n            for price in prices:\n                # Check if the current price can be added without exceeding the budget\n                if total_spent + price <= k:\n                    total_spent += price  # Add the price to the total spent\n                    count += 1  # Increment the count of chocolates\n                else:\n                    break  # Stop if the budget is exceeded\n    \n            # Return the maximum number of chocolates that can be bought\n            return count\n\n        # Read input from standard input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        # Parse the input\n        n = int(data[0])\n        k = int(data[1])\n        prices = list(map(int, data[2:]))\n\n        # Call the function and print the result\n        result = maxChocolates(n, k, prices)\n        print(result)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Input Handling**: The `sys.stdin.read` function is used to read all input at once, which is then split into a list of strings. The first two elements are parsed as integers for `n` and `k`, and the rest are converted into a list of integers representing the prices.\n        - **Output Handling**: The result from the `maxChocolates` function is printed directly.\n        - **Function Call**: The function is called with the parsed input values, ensuring that the logic is executed and the result is outputted correctly.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n            # Sort the prices in ascending order\n            prices.sort()\n    \n            # Initialize the count of chocolates and the total money spent\n            count = 0\n            total_spent = 0\n    \n            # Iterate over the sorted prices\n            for price in prices:\n                # Check if the current price can be added without exceeding the budget\n                if total_spent + price <= k:\n                    total_spent += price  # Add the price to the total spent\n                    count += 1  # Increment the count of chocolates\n                else:\n                    break  # Stop if the budget is exceeded\n    \n            # Return the maximum number of chocolates that can be bought\n            return count\n\n        # Read input from standard input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        # Parse the input\n        n = int(data[0])\n        k = int(data[1])\n        prices = list(map(int, data[2:]))\n\n        # Call the function and print the result\n        result = maxChocolates(n, k, prices)\n        print(result)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Input Handling**: The code reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is suitable for competitive programming environments where input is provided in bulk. The input is split into a list of strings, and the first two elements are parsed as integers for `n` (number of chocolates) and `k` (budget). The remaining elements are converted into a list of integers representing the prices of chocolates.\n        - **Function Logic**: The `maxChocolates` function sorts the prices and iterates through them, adding prices to the total spent as long as the budget is not exceeded. It counts the number of chocolates that can be bought within the budget.\n        - **Output**: The result from the function is printed directly, which is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['7 50', '1 12 5 111 200 1000 10'] Output: 4\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

The core concept was to use a sliding window technique to efficiently calculate the maximum sum of money that could be obtained by unlocking `k` consecutive rooms starting from either end of the row of rooms.\n\nThe key insight was to consider two main strategies: starting from the leftmost room and moving right, or starting from the rightmost room and moving left.

This method involved iteratively moving one room from the left sum to the right sum and updating the maximum money obtained.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the utility of the sliding window technique for problems involving subarray sums and constraints on the number of elements that can be selected.
