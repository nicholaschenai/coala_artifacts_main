    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nMr. Krabs wants to maximize the amount of money he can steal from a row of rooms. Each room is initially locked, and he can only unlock rooms using keys. He can start unlocking from either of the two corner rooms. Each key can unlock one room, and to unlock an inner room, an adjacent room must be unlocked first. Given the number of rooms, the money in each room, and the number of keys, we need to determine the maximum money Mr. Krabs can obtain.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initial Access**: Mr. Krabs can start unlocking from either the first or the last room.\n2. **Key Usage**: Each key can unlock one room, and unlocking must proceed from an already unlocked room to an adjacent one.\n3. **Maximize Money**: We need to find a strategy to use the keys such that the total money collected is maximized.\n4. **Strategy**: Consider two scenarios:\n   - Start unlocking from the leftmost room and move right.\n   - Start unlocking from the rightmost room and move left.\n5. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use a sliding window of size `k` to calculate the maximum money that can be collected by unlocking `k` consecutive rooms starting from either end.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize `max_money` to 0.\n2. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the left.\n3. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the right.\n4. Use a sliding window to adjust the sums by moving one room from the opposite end to the current end:\n   - For each possible split of keys between the left and right ends, calculate the total money.\n   - Update `max_money` if the current total is greater.\n5. Return `max_money`.\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef maxMoney(n, A, k):\n    # Initialize max_money to 0\n    max_money = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the left\n    left_sum = sum(A[:k])\n    max_money = max(max_money, left_sum)\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the right\n    right_sum = sum(A[-k:])\n    max_money = max(max_money, right_sum)\n    \n    # Use a sliding window to calculate the maximum money\n    # by considering different splits of keys between left and right\n    current_left_sum = left_sum\n    current_right_sum = 0\n    \n    for i in range(k):\n        # Move one room from the left to the right\n        current_left_sum -= A[k - 1 - i]\n        current_right_sum += A[-(i + 1)]\n        \n        # Calculate the total money for this split\n        current_total = current_left_sum + current_right_sum\n        max_money = max(max_money, current_total)\n    \n    return max_money\n\n# Read input from standard input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse the input\nn = int(data[0])\nA = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\nk = int(data[n+1])\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = maxMoney(n, A, k)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initial Sums**: We calculate the sum of the first `k` rooms from both the left and right ends.\n- **Sliding Window**: We adjust the sums by moving one room from the left sum to the right sum iteratively, updating the maximum money possible.\n- **Output**: The maximum money Mr. Krabs can obtain with `k` keys is printed.",
