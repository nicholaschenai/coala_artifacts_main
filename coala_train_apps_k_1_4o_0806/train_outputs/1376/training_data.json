    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Duck Distribution Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem involves distributing a fixed number of ducks of various colors into boxes, with constraints on the number of ducks per box and the number of distinct colors allowed. The key challenge is to ensure that each box contains exactly `K` ducks and at most two distinct colors, while also ensuring that all ducks are placed in the boxes.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\nInitially, the strategy was to use a greedy approach by filling each box with the most abundant color first and then using a second color if needed. This approach seemed logical but required careful handling of the order in which colors were selected and placed in boxes.\n\nOne of the main challenges was ensuring the output format matched the expected results, particularly the order of colors in each box. The problem allows any valid solution, but the test cases expected a specific order, which was not initially considered.\n\n#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\nThe primary error encountered was related to the output order of colors in the boxes. The solution initially did not account for the specific order expected in the test cases. This was fixed by ensuring that the output order of colors in each box was consistent, swapping the order if necessary to match the expected format.\n\nAdditionally, the logic for filling boxes needed to be adjusted to ensure that the list of colors was re-sorted after each box was filled, maintaining the priority of filling boxes with the most available colors first.\n\n#### Final Solution\nThe final solution involved:\n- Sorting the colors by their count to prioritize filling boxes with the most available colors.\n- Filling each box with the most available color and using a second color if needed.\n- Re-sorting the list of colors after each box was filled to maintain optimal filling.\n- Ensuring the output order of colors in each box was consistent with the expected results.\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering output format requirements and the need for dynamic sorting in greedy algorithms to maintain optimal solutions.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Greedy Approach**: The problem can be effectively solved using a greedy approach. The idea is to always try to fill a box with as many ducks of a single color as possible, and then use a second color if needed. This ensures that each box is filled optimally with respect to the constraints.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution handles edge cases, such as when there are exactly two colors and specific constraints on `N` and `K`, by using a dictionary to map the original indices of colors. This ensures that the output format is consistent with the expected results.\n\n3. **Iterative Filling**: The solution iteratively fills each box by checking the available ducks of each color and adjusting the counts accordingly. This is done in a loop until all boxes are filled, ensuring that the constraints are met.\n\n### Why the Official Solution Works\n\n- **Correct Logic**: The official solution correctly implements the logic to fill each box with at most two colors, ensuring that the total number of ducks in each box is exactly `K`.\n- **Output Consistency**: By maintaining a mapping of original indices, the solution ensures that the output format is consistent with the expected results, which was a point of failure in my previous attempts.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints by using a simple loop and condition checks, making it suitable for large input sizes.\n\n### Learnings\n\n- **Importance of Output Format**: Ensuring that the output format matches the expected results is crucial, especially in competitive programming. This includes maintaining the order of colors and ensuring the correct number of ducks per color.\n- **Iterative Problem Solving**: Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and iteratively solving each part can lead to a more robust solution.\n- **Handling Edge Cases**: Always consider edge cases and special conditions in the problem statement to ensure the solution is comprehensive.\n\nIn summary, the official solution provides a clear and efficient approach to solving the problem by focusing on a greedy strategy and maintaining output consistency. This experience highlights the importance of careful problem analysis and iterative solution development.",
