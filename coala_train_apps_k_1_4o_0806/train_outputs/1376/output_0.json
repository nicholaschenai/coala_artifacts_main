    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nSalmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors. We need to find a valid distribution for each test case.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the values of `N` and `K`, followed by the list of duck counts for each color.\n\n2. **Distribution Strategy**:\n   - Use a greedy approach to fill the boxes.\n   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes with as many ducks of that color as possible.\n   - If a box cannot be completely filled with one color, use a second color to fill the remaining space.\n   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.\n\n3. **Output**: For each test case, output the distribution of ducks in each box, ensuring that each box contains exactly `K` ducks and at most two distinct colors.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N, K\n        read duck_counts\n        \n        initialize a list to store the result for each box\n        \n        while there are ducks left to place:\n            find the color with the most ducks remaining\n            fill as many boxes as possible with this color\n            if a box cannot be completely filled, find another color to fill the remaining space\n            \n            update the result list with the distribution for each box\n            \n        output the result for each test case\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case[0]\n        duck_counts = case[1]\n        \n        # List to store the result for each box\n        boxes = []\n        \n        # While there are ducks left to place\n        while sum(duck_counts) > 0:\n            # Find the color with the most ducks remaining\n            max_color = max(range(len(duck_counts)), key=lambda i: duck_counts[i])\n            \n            # Fill as many boxes as possible with this color\n            while duck_counts[max_color] > 0 and len(boxes) < N:\n                if duck_counts[max_color] >= K:\n                    # Fill a box completely with this color\n                    boxes.append((max_color, K, 0, 0))\n                    duck_counts[max_color] -= K\n                else:\n                    # Fill the box partially and find another color to fill the rest\n                    remaining_space = K - duck_counts[max_color]\n                    second_color = next(i for i in range(len(duck_counts)) if i != max_color and duck_counts[i] > 0)\n                    \n                    if duck_counts[second_color] >= remaining_space:\n                        boxes.append((max_color, duck_counts[max_color], second_color, remaining_space))\n                        duck_counts[second_color] -= remaining_space\n                        duck_counts[max_color] = 0\n                    else:\n                        # If the second color can't fill the remaining space, swap roles\n                        boxes.append((max_color, duck_counts[max_color], second_color, duck_counts[second_color]))\n                        duck_counts[max_color] -= (K - duck_counts[second_color])\n                        duck_counts[second_color] = 0\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(boxes)\n    \n    # Output the results\n    for result in results:\n        for box in result:\n            print(box[0], box[1], box[2], box[3])\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 1\n# test_cases = [((2, 4), [3, 4, 1])]\n# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes each test case to distribute the ducks into boxes, and outputs the result.
