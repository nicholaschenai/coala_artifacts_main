    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). The walls are represented as line segments from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i) for each wall i. For each starting position (x_j, y_j) of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are in his path to the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Walls**: Each wall is represented by the line x + y = a_i. If Chef's starting point (x_j, y_j) satisfies this equation for any wall, he is on the wall, and we return -1.\n\n2. **Count Walls**: If Chef is not on a wall, we need to count how many walls he crosses. This is equivalent to counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: Since the a_i values are sorted, we can use binary search to efficiently find how many walls Chef needs to break.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. For each test case:\n   - Read the number of walls `N` and the list of wall positions `a`.\n   - Read the number of queries `Q`.\n   - For each query:\n     - Read the starting position `(x_j, y_j)`.\n     - Calculate `sum_xy = x_j + y_j`.\n     - If `sum_xy` is in the list `a`, print `-1`.\n     - Otherwise, use binary search to find the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `sum_xy` and print this count.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        Q = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        \n        a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall\n        \n        for _ in range(Q):\n            x_j = int(data[index])\n            y_j = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            \n            sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n            if sum_xy in a_set:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                low, high = 0, N\n                while low < high:\n                    mid = (low + high) // 2\n                    if a[mid] > sum_xy:\n                        high = mid\n                    else:\n                        low = mid + 1\n                results.append(N - low)\n    \n    sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n```\n\nThis code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging binary search to count the number of walls Chef needs to break, and uses a set to quickly determine if Chef starts on a wall.",
