## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
1 3
5
0 0
2 0
0 4
1 1
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
0
1
2
1
-1

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to help Chef reach Dr. Doof by determining how many walls Chef needs to break through. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, each starting from a point on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis. For each starting position of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are in his path to the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Walls**: Each wall is represented by a line segment from `(a_i, 0)` to `(0, a_i)`. The equation of such a line is `x + y = a_i`.

2. **Chef's Position**: For each query, Chef starts at `(x_j, y_j)`. We need to check:
   - If `x_j + y_j = a_i` for any `a_i`, Chef is on a wall, and we return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, count how many `a_i` are greater than `x_j + y_j` because these are the walls Chef needs to break through.

3. **Efficient Search**: Since the `a_i` values are sorted, we can use binary search to efficiently determine how many walls Chef needs to break through.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_queries(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = number of walls
        a = list of wall positions
        Q = number of queries
        queries = list of starting positions

        for each query (x_j, y_j):
            sum_xy = x_j + y_j

            if sum_xy is in a:
                print -1
            else:
                count = number of a_i greater than sum_xy
                print count

function main():
    read T
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        read N
        read list a of size N
        read Q
        read list of queries of size Q
        test_cases.append((N, a, Q, queries))
    
    process_queries(T, test_cases)
```

### Python Code

```python
def process_queries(T, test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, a, Q, queries = test_case
        
        for x_j, y_j in queries:
            sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
            # Check if sum_xy is on any wall
            if sum_xy in a:
                print(-1)
            else:
                # Use binary search to find the number of walls to break
                # Find the first index where a[i] > sum_xy
                low, high = 0, N
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if a[mid] > sum_xy:
                        high = mid
                    else:
                        low = mid + 1
                
                # The number of walls to break is from index `low` to the end
                print(N - low)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    test_cases = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        Q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        queries = []
        for _ in range(Q):
            x_j = int(data[index])
            y_j = int(data[index + 1])
            queries.append((x_j, y_j))
            index += 2
        test_cases.append((N, a, Q, queries))
    
    process_queries(T, test_cases)

```

This code reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the number of walls Chef needs to break through for each query. It uses binary search to efficiently determine the number of walls in Chef's path.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$.

Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). The walls are represented as line segments from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i) for each wall i. For each starting position (x_j, y_j) of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are in his path to the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Walls**: Each wall is represented by the line x + y = a_i. If Chef's starting point (x_j, y_j) satisfies this equation for any wall, he is on the wall, and we return -1.

2. **Count Walls**: If Chef is not on a wall, we need to count how many walls he crosses. This is equivalent to counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.

3. **Efficient Search**: Since the a_i values are sorted, we can use binary search to efficiently find how many walls Chef needs to break.

### Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read the number of walls `N` and the list of wall positions `a`.
   - Read the number of queries `Q`.
   - For each query:
     - Read the starting position `(x_j, y_j)`.
     - Calculate `sum_xy = x_j + y_j`.
     - If `sum_xy` is in the list `a`, print `-1`.
     - Otherwise, use binary search to find the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `sum_xy` and print this count.

### Python Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        Q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall
        
        for _ in range(Q):
            x_j = int(data[index])
            y_j = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
            if sum_xy in a_set:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                low, high = 0, N
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if a[mid] > sum_xy:
                        high = mid
                    else:
                        low = mid + 1
                results.append(N - low)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

```

This code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging binary search to count the number of walls Chef needs to break, and uses a set to quickly determine if Chef starts on a wall.

     - Otherwise, use binary search to find the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `sum_xy` and print this count.

### Python Code

    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])

                low, high = 0, N
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if a[mid] > sum_xy:
                        high = mid
                    else:
                        low = mid + 1
                results.append(N - low)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

```

This code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging binary search to count the number of walls Chef needs to break, and uses a set to quickly determine if Chef starts on a wall.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
1 3
5
0 0
2 0
0 4
1 1
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
0
1
2
1
-1

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 970 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). The walls are represented as line segments from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i) for each wall i. For each starting position (x_j, y_j) of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are in his path to the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Walls**: Each wall is represented by the line x + y = a_i. If Chef's starting point (x_j, y_j) satisfies this equation for any wall, he is on the wall, and we return -1.

2. **Count Walls**: If Chef is not on a wall, we need to count how many walls he crosses. This is equivalent to counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.

3. **Efficient Search**: Since the a_i values are sorted, we can use binary search to efficiently find how many walls Chef needs to break.

### Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read the number of walls `N` and the list of wall positions `a`.
   - Read the number of queries `Q`.
   - For each query:
     - Read the starting position `(x_j, y_j)`.
     - Calculate `sum_xy = x_j + y_j`.
     - If `sum_xy` is in the list `a`, print `-1`.
     - Otherwise, use binary search to find the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `sum_xy` and print this count.

### Python Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        Q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall
        
        for _ in range(Q):
            x_j = int(data[index])
            y_j = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
            if sum_xy in a_set:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                low, high = 0, N
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if a[mid] > sum_xy:
                        high = mid
                    else:
                        low = mid + 1
                results.append(N - low)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] Let's analyze the code and the feedback to identify the issue:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from or writing to standard IO. This is a common problem when the function `solve()` is defined but not called, or when the input/output is not handled correctly.

2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be called explicitly to execute the logic.

3. **Output**: The output is expected to be printed, but the feedback indicates that no output was detected. This suggests that the function might not be executed at all.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the logic is executed.

2. **Check Input/Output**: Verify that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Although the logic seems correct, ensure that the binary search and set operations are functioning as intended.

### Revised Code

Let's make sure the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly:

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        Q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall
        
        for _ in range(Q):
            x_j = int(data[index])
            y_j = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
            if sum_xy in a_set:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                low, high = 0, N
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if a[mid] > sum_xy:
                        high = mid
                    else:
                        low = mid + 1
                results.append(N - low)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
- **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.
- **Logic**: The logic remains the same, using a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.

We need to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). The walls are represented as line segments from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i) for each wall i. For each starting position (x_j, y_j) of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are in his path to the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Walls**: Each wall is represented by the line x + y = a_i. If Chef's starting point (x_j, y_j) satisfies this equation for any wall, he is on the wall, and we return -1.

2. **Count Walls**: If Chef is not on a wall, we need to count how many walls he crosses. This is equivalent to counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.

   - Read the number of queries `Q`.

                results.append(N - low)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

```

This code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging binary search to count the number of walls Chef needs to break, and uses a set to quickly determine if Chef starts on a wall.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 970 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and the feedback to identify the issue:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from or writing to standard IO. This is a common problem when the function `solve()` is defined but not called, or when the input/output is not handled correctly.

2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be called explicitly to execute the logic.

3. **Output**: The output is expected to be printed, but the feedback indicates that no output was detected. This suggests that the function might not be executed at all.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the logic is executed.

2. **Check Input/Output**: Verify that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Although the logic seems correct, ensure that the binary search and set operations are functioning as intended.

### Revised Code

Let's make sure the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly:

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        Q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall
        
        for _ in range(Q):
            x_j = int(data[index])
            y_j = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
            if sum_xy in a_set:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                low, high = 0, N
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if a[mid] > sum_xy:
                        high = mid
                    else:
                        low = mid + 1
                results.append(N - low)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
- **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.
- **Logic**: The logic remains the same, using a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.

Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Prefix Sum Optimization**: My approach used a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.

    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.

    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.

    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
1 3
5
0 0
2 0
0 4
1 1
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
0
1
2
1
-1

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 970 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). The walls are represented as line segments from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i) for each wall i. For each starting position (x_j, y_j) of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are in his path to the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Walls**: Each wall is represented by the line x + y = a_i. If Chef's starting point (x_j, y_j) satisfies this equation for any wall, he is on the wall, and we return -1.

2. **Count Walls**: If Chef is not on a wall, we need to count how many walls he crosses. This is equivalent to counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.

3. **Efficient Search**: Since the a_i values are sorted, we can use binary search to efficiently find how many walls Chef needs to break.

### Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read the number of walls `N` and the list of wall positions `a`.
   - Read the number of queries `Q`.
   - For each query:
     - Read the starting position `(x_j, y_j)`.
     - Calculate `sum_xy = x_j + y_j`.
     - If `sum_xy` is in the list `a`, print `-1`.
     - Otherwise, use binary search to find the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `sum_xy` and print this count.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 970 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and the feedback to identify the issue:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from or writing to standard IO. This is a common problem when the function `solve()` is defined but not called, or when the input/output is not handled correctly.

2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be called explicitly to execute the logic.

3. **Output**: The output is expected to be printed, but the feedback indicates that no output was detected. This suggests that the function might not be executed at all.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the logic is executed.

2. **Check Input/Output**: Verify that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Although the logic seems correct, ensure that the binary search and set operations are functioning as intended.

### Revised Code

Let's make sure the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly:

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        Q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall

            x_j = int(data[index])
            y_j = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
            if sum_xy in a_set:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                low, high = 0, N

    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

# Call the solve function to execute the logic

```

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
- **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.
- **Logic**: The logic remains the same, using a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] In this problem, the main task was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, given a set of walls represented by line segments in the first quadrant. The key concepts involved were understanding geometric line equations and efficiently searching through sorted data.

### Core Concepts and Patterns

1. **Geometric Representation**: Each wall is represented by the line equation x + y = a_i. If Chef's starting point satisfies this equation, he is on the wall.

2. **Efficient Search**: Given that the wall positions (a_i) are sorted, binary search is an optimal strategy to quickly determine how many walls Chef needs to break.

### Strategies and Fixes

- **Initial Approach**: The initial solution correctly implemented the logic but failed to execute due to not calling the function. This highlighted the importance of ensuring that the function is invoked, especially in competitive programming environments where the main function is not automatically executed.

- **Input/Output Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write` was crucial for handling large input and output efficiently, which is a common requirement in competitive programming.

- **Set for Quick Checks**: Using a set to check if Chef starts on a wall was an effective strategy to quickly determine if the output should be -1.

### Unexpected Errors

The main error was not calling the `solve()` function, which resulted in no output being detected. This was a simple oversight but served as a reminder to always ensure that the main logic is executed.

Overall, this problem reinforced the importance of efficient searching techniques like binary search and the need for careful input/output handling in performance-critical applications.

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
1 3
5
0 0
2 0
0 4
1 1
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
0
1
2
1
-1

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 970 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). The walls are represented as line segments from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i) for each wall i. For each starting position (x_j, y_j) of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are in his path to the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Walls**: Each wall is represented by the line x + y = a_i. If Chef's starting point (x_j, y_j) satisfies this equation for any wall, he is on the wall, and we return -1.

2. **Count Walls**: If Chef is not on a wall, we need to count how many walls he crosses. This is equivalent to counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.

3. **Efficient Search**: Since the a_i values are sorted, we can use binary search to efficiently find how many walls Chef needs to break.

### Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read the number of walls `N` and the list of wall positions `a`.
   - Read the number of queries `Q`.
   - For each query:
     - Read the starting position `(x_j, y_j)`.
     - Calculate `sum_xy = x_j + y_j`.
     - If `sum_xy` is in the list `a`, print `-1`.
     - Otherwise, use binary search to find the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `sum_xy` and print this count.

### Python Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        Q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall
        
        for _ in range(Q):
            x_j = int(data[index])
            y_j = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
            if sum_xy in a_set:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                low, high = 0, N
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if a[mid] > sum_xy:
                        high = mid
                    else:
                        low = mid + 1
                results.append(N - low)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

The problem involved determining how many walls Chef needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, given a set of walls represented by line segments. The challenge was to efficiently determine if Chef starts on a wall and, if not, how many walls he needs to cross.

#### Key Insights:

1. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: Both my solution and the official solution use binary search to efficiently determine the number of walls Chef needs to break. This is crucial given the constraints, as it reduces the complexity from linear to logarithmic time for each query.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution explicitly checks if the sum of coordinates is less than the smallest wall or greater than the largest wall, which are edge cases that can be handled directly without binary search. This is a small optimization that can save some computation time.

3. **Set for Quick Lookup**: My solution used a set to quickly check if Chef starts on a wall, which is a common technique to achieve O(1) average time complexity for membership tests.

4. **Function Decomposition**: The official solution uses a helper function `posSearch` to encapsulate the binary search logic. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand, as the search logic is separated from the main flow of the program.

#### Lessons Learned:

- **Function Modularity**: Breaking down the problem into smaller functions can make the code cleaner and more maintainable. The `posSearch` function in the official solution is a good example of this practice.

- **Edge Case Handling**: Explicitly handling edge cases outside of the main logic can simplify the core algorithm and improve performance slightly.

- **Efficient I/O Handling**: Both solutions use efficient input/output handling, which is crucial in competitive programming to deal with large datasets.

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient searching techniques like binary search and the value of modular code design.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes a list of integers representing wall positions and a series of queries. For each query, it checks if the sum of two given coordinates is equal to any wall position; if so, it appends -1 to the results. If not, it performs a binary search to count how many wall positions are greater than the sum of the coordinates and appends this count to the results. Finally, it outputs the results for all queries across all test cases.

[Problem]
    You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
    Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

    -----Input-----
    - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
    - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
    - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
    - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
    - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

    -----Output-----
    For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
    - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
    - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
    - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
    - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
    - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

    -----Sample Input-----
    1
    2
    1 3
    5
    0 0
    2 0
    0 4
    1 1
    1 2

    -----Sample Output-----
    0
    1
    2
    1
    -1

    -----Explanation-----
    The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

    If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

    If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

    If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

    If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

    As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.
