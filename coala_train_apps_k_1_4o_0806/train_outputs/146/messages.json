Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such encoded patterns. The input string is guaranteed to be valid, meaning it will not contain any malformed brackets or unexpected characters.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo decode the string, we need to process it character by character. We can use a stack to help manage nested encoded patterns. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and numbers.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string:\n   - If the character is a digit, build the complete number (since numbers can have multiple digits).\n   - If the character is `[`, push the current number and the current string onto the stack, then reset them.\n   - If the character is `]`, pop from the stack to get the last string and the number, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last string.\n   - If the character is a letter, append it to the current string.\n3. At the end of the iteration, the current string will contain the fully decoded string.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction decodeString(s):\n    stack = []\n    current_string = \"\"\n    current_number = 0\n\n    for each character in s:\n        if character is a digit:\n            update current_number\n        else if character is '[':\n            push (current_string, current_number) to stack\n            reset current_string to \"\"\n            reset current_number to 0\n        else if character is ']':\n            pop (last_string, number) from stack\n            current_string = last_string + (current_string repeated number times)\n        else:\n            append character to current_string\n\n    return current_string\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        # Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and numbers\n        stack = []\n        current_string = \"\"\n        current_number = 0\n\n        # Iterate over each character in the input string\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                # If the character is a digit, update the current number\n                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)\n            elif char == '[':\n                # If the character is '[', push the current string and number onto the stack\n                stack.append((current_string, current_number))\n                # Reset the current string and number\n                current_string = \"\"\n                current_number = 0\n            elif char == ']':\n                # If the character is ']', pop from the stack\n                last_string, number = stack.pop()\n                # Repeat the current string 'number' times and append to the last string\n                current_string = last_string + current_string * number\n            else:\n                # If the character is a letter, append it to the current string\n                current_string += char\n\n        # Return the fully decoded string\n        return current_string\n```\n"

For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line `i` (0-indexed) contains a sequence of numbers starting from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `0` up to `i`. The pattern should be printed for each test case.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.\n        2. **Pattern Generation**:\n           - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.\n           - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):\n             - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.\n             - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.\n           - Print the generated pattern for each test case.\n        3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n            for each K in test_cases:\n                for i from 0 to K-1:\n                    line = \"\"\n                    for j from i down to 0:\n                        line += str(j)\n                    for j from 1 to i:\n                        line += str(j)\n                    print(line)\n                print a newline to separate test cases\n\n        read T from input\n        read test_cases from input\n        generate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n\n        ### Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n            for K in test_cases:\n                for i in range(K):\n                    line = \"\"\n                    # Append numbers from i down to 0\n                    for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                    # Append numbers from 1 up to i\n                    for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                    print(line)\n                # Print a newline to separate test cases\n                print()\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\n        generate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code\n\n        - **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `K` for each test case.\n        - **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, we generate `K` lines.

The pattern involves numbers followed by square brackets containing a substring. The number indicates how many times the substring inside the brackets should be repeated. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns and returning the fully decoded string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the current state as we parse through the string. We will iterate over each character in the string:\n   - If we encounter a digit, we will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.\n   - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it indicates the start of a new encoded substring, so we push the current state (current string and repeat count) onto the stack.\n   - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded substring. We pop the last state from the stack, repeat the substring the specified number of times, and append it to the previous string.\n   - If we encounter a letter, we simply append it to the current string being built.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function decodeString(s):\n       Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and repeat counts\n       Initialize current_string as an empty string\n       Initialize current_num as 0\n\n       for each character in s:\n           if character is a digit:\n               Update current_num to include this digit\n           else if character is '[':\n               Push (current_string, current_num) onto the stack\n               Reset current_string to empty and current_num to 0\n           else if character is ']':\n               Pop (prev_string, repeat_count) from the stack\n               Update current_string to prev_string + (current_string repeated repeat_count times)\n           else:\n               Append character to current_string\n\n       return current_string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        # Initialize a stack to keep track of previous strings and repeat counts\n        stack = []\n        current_string = \"\"\n        current_num = 0\n\n        # Iterate over each character in the input string\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                # If the character is a digit, update the current number\n                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)\n            elif char == '[':\n                # If the character is '[', push the current state onto the stack\n                stack.append((current_string, current_num))\n                # Reset current_string and current_num for the new context\n                current_string = \"\"\n                current_num = 0\n            elif char == ']':\n                # If the character is ']', pop the last state from the stack\n                prev_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                # Repeat the current_string and append it to the previous string\n                current_string = prev_string + current_string * repeat_count\n            else:\n                # If the character is a letter, append it to the current string\n                current_string += char\n\n        # Return the fully decoded string\n        return current_string\n```\n\nThis solution uses a stack to manage nested structures and handles multiple digits for repeat counts, ensuring the correct decoding of the input string."

When a closing bracket `]` is encountered, we pop the last state from the stack, repeat the current string the specified number of times, and append it to the previous string.\n\nKey points to remember:\n- Use a stack to manage nested structures.\n- Handle multi-digit numbers for repeat counts by accumulating digits.\n- Reset the current string and number when entering a new bracketed section.\n\nThis approach efficiently decodes the string by leveraging the stack to manage the nested and sequential nature of the encoded input.

This is a common approach for problems involving nested or hierarchical data, such as parsing expressions with parentheses or brackets.\n\n2. **Handling Numbers**: The official solution uses a string `num` to accumulate digits until a non-digit character is encountered. This is a slightly different approach compared to my solution, where I directly updated `current_num` by multiplying the existing value by 10 and adding the new digit. Both methods are valid, but the official solution's approach might be more intuitive for handling multi-digit numbers.\n\n3. **Stack Initialization**: The official solution initializes the stack with a default entry `[\"\", 1]`. This ensures that there is always a base string to append to, which simplifies the logic when popping from the stack. This is a clever way to handle the initial state and avoid special cases for the first segment of the string.\n\n4. **Appending to the Current String**: In the official solution, characters are directly appended to the string at the top of the stack. This is a concise way to manage the current string being built, as it eliminates the need for a separate `current_string` variable.\n\nOverall, the official solution is slightly more concise and elegant, particularly in its initialization of the stack and handling of numbers. These insights can be useful for similar problems involving nested structures or parsing tasks."

When a ']' is encountered, it pops the last saved state from the stack, repeats the current string by the saved count, and appends it to the saved string.
