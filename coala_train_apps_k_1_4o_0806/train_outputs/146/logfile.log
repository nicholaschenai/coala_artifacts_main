## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string that is encoded using a specific format: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a substring that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such encoded patterns. The input string is guaranteed to be valid, meaning it will not contain any malformed brackets or unexpected characters.

## Conceptual Solution

To decode the string, we need to process it character by character. We can use a stack to help manage nested encoded patterns. Here's the plan:

1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and numbers.
2. Iterate over each character in the string:
   - If the character is a digit, build the complete number (since numbers can have multiple digits).
   - If the character is `[`, push the current number and the current string onto the stack, then reset them.
   - If the character is `]`, pop from the stack to get the last string and the number, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last string.
   - If the character is a letter, append it to the current string.
3. At the end of the iteration, the current string will contain the fully decoded string.

## Pseudocode

```
function decodeString(s):
    stack = []
    current_string = ""
    current_number = 0

    for each character in s:
        if character is a digit:
            update current_number
        else if character is '[':
            push (current_string, current_number) to stack
            reset current_string to ""
            reset current_number to 0
        else if character is ']':
            pop (last_string, number) from stack
            current_string = last_string + (current_string repeated number times)
        else:
            append character to current_string

    return current_string
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and numbers
        stack = []
        current_string = ""
        current_number = 0

        # Iterate over each character in the input string
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # If the character is a digit, update the current number
                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                # If the character is '[', push the current string and number onto the stack
                stack.append((current_string, current_number))
                # Reset the current string and number
                current_string = ""
                current_number = 0
            elif char == ']':
                # If the character is ']', pop from the stack
                last_string, number = stack.pop()
                # Repeat the current string 'number' times and append to the last string
                current_string = last_string + current_string * number
            else:
                # If the character is a letter, append it to the current string
                current_string += char

        # Return the fully decoded string
        return current_string

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to generate a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line `i` (0-indexed) contains a sequence of numbers starting from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `0` up to `i`. The pattern should be printed for each test case.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
        2. **Pattern Generation**:
           - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
           - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
             - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
             - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
           - Print the generated pattern for each test case.
        3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
            for each K in test_cases:
                for i from 0 to K-1:
                    line = ""
                    for j from i down to 0:
                        line += str(j)
                    for j from 1 to i:
                        line += str(j)
                    print(line)
                print a newline to separate test cases

        read T from input
        read test_cases from input
        generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
        ```

        ### Python Code

        ```python
        def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
            for K in test_cases:
                for i in range(K):
                    line = ""
                    # Append numbers from i down to 0
                    for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                        line += str(j)
                    # Append numbers from 1 up to i
                    for j in range(1, i + 1):
                        line += str(j)
                    print(line)
                # Print a newline to separate test cases
                print()

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

        generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `K` for each test case.
        - **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, we generate `K` lines. Each line is constructed by concatenating numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
        - **Output**: After generating the pattern for each test case, we print a newline to separate the outputs of different test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string that is encoded using a specific pattern. The pattern involves numbers followed by square brackets containing a substring. The number indicates how many times the substring inside the brackets should be repeated. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns and returning the fully decoded string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the current state as we parse through the string. We will iterate over each character in the string:
   - If we encounter a digit, we will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.
   - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it indicates the start of a new encoded substring, so we push the current state (current string and repeat count) onto the stack.
   - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded substring. We pop the last state from the stack, repeat the substring the specified number of times, and append it to the previous string.
   - If we encounter a letter, we simply append it to the current string being built.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function decodeString(s):
       Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and repeat counts
       Initialize current_string as an empty string
       Initialize current_num as 0

       for each character in s:
           if character is a digit:
               Update current_num to include this digit
           else if character is '[':
               Push (current_string, current_num) onto the stack
               Reset current_string to empty and current_num to 0
           else if character is ']':
               Pop (prev_string, repeat_count) from the stack
               Update current_string to prev_string + (current_string repeated repeat_count times)
           else:
               Append character to current_string

       return current_string
   ```

                current_num = 0
            elif char == ']':
                # If the character is ']', pop the last state from the stack
                prev_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()
                # Repeat the current_string and append it to the previous string

INFO - [Task id] 146 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string that is encoded using a specific pattern. The pattern involves numbers followed by square brackets containing a substring. The number indicates how many times the substring inside the brackets should be repeated. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns and returning the fully decoded string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the current state as we parse through the string. We will iterate over each character in the string:
   - If we encounter a digit, we will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.
   - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it indicates the start of a new encoded substring, so we push the current state (current string and repeat count) onto the stack.
   - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded substring. We pop the last state from the stack, repeat the substring the specified number of times, and append it to the previous string.
   - If we encounter a letter, we simply append it to the current string being built.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function decodeString(s):
       Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and repeat counts
       Initialize current_string as an empty string
       Initialize current_num as 0

       for each character in s:
           if character is a digit:
               Update current_num to include this digit
           else if character is '[':

           else if character is ']':
               Pop (prev_string, repeat_count) from the stack
               Update current_string to prev_string + (current_string repeated repeat_count times)

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] In this problem, I tackled the task of decoding a string that follows a specific encoding pattern using a stack-based approach. The core concept here is to manage nested structures and repeat counts effectively, which is a common pattern in problems involving parsing and decoding.

The strategy that worked involved using a stack to keep track of the current state (the current string being built and the repeat count) whenever we encounter an opening bracket `[`. This allows us to handle nested encoded strings by pushing the current context onto the stack and resetting for the new context. When a closing bracket `]` is encountered, we pop the last state from the stack, repeat the current string the specified number of times, and append it to the previous string.

Key points to remember:
- Use a stack to manage nested structures.
- Handle multi-digit numbers for repeat counts by accumulating digits.
- Reset the current string and number when entering a new bracketed section.

This approach efficiently decodes the string by leveraging the stack to manage the nested and sequential nature of the encoded input. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and robustness.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] In reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

1. **Stack Utilization**: Both my solution and the official solution effectively use a stack to manage nested structures. This is a common approach for problems involving nested or hierarchical data, such as parsing expressions with parentheses or brackets.

2. **Handling Numbers**: The official solution uses a string `num` to accumulate digits until a non-digit character is encountered. This is a slightly different approach compared to my solution, where I directly updated `current_num` by multiplying the existing value by 10 and adding the new digit. Both methods are valid, but the official solution's approach might be more intuitive for handling multi-digit numbers.

3. **Stack Initialization**: The official solution initializes the stack with a default entry `["", 1]`. This ensures that there is always a base string to append to, which simplifies the logic when popping from the stack. This is a clever way to handle the initial state and avoid special cases for the first segment of the string.

4. **Appending to the Current String**: In the official solution, characters are directly appended to the string at the top of the stack. This is a concise way to manage the current string being built, as it eliminates the need for a separate `current_string` variable.

Overall, the official solution is slightly more concise and elegant, particularly in its initialization of the stack and handling of numbers. These insights can be useful for similar problems involving nested structures or parsing tasks.

    Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


    Examples:

    s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
    s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
    s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".
