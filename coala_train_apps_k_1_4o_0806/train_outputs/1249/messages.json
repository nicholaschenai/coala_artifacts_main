We need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair in the permutation equals K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Function f(P):** \n   - For a permutation P of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair in the permutation.\n   - For example, if P = [p1, p2, ..., pN], then f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).\n\n2. **Constraints and Observations:**\n   - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.\n   - The minimum possible value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.\n\n3. **Approach:**\n   - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.\n   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.\n   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.\n   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.\n\n4. **Constructing the Permutation:**\n   - Start with the permutation [N, N-1, ..., 1].\n   - Calculate the current sum of maximums.\n   - If the current sum is greater than K, swap elements to reduce the sum until it equals K.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_permutation(N, K):\n    max_sum = N + (N-1) + ... + 2\n    min_sum = N - 1\n    \n    if K < min_sum or K > max_sum:\n        return -1\n    \n    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]\n    current_sum = max_sum\n    \n    for i from 0 to N-2:\n        if current_sum == K:\n            break\n        # Try to reduce the sum by swapping\n        for j from N-1 down to i+1:\n            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:\n                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])\n                swap(permutation[i], permutation[j])\n                break\n    \n    return permutation\n\nread T\nfor each test case:\n    read N, K\n    result = find_permutation(N, K)\n    print result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_permutation(N, K):\n    # Calculate the maximum and minimum possible sums\n    max_sum = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n    min_sum = N - 1\n    \n    # If K is out of the possible range, return -1\n    if K < min_sum or K > max_sum:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Start with the permutation in decreasing order\n    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n    current_sum = max_sum\n    \n    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K\n    for i in range(N - 1):\n        if current_sum == K:\n            break\n        # Try to reduce the sum by swapping\n        for j in range(N - 1, i, -1):\n            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:\n                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])\n                permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]\n                break\n    \n    return permutation\n\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\nresults = []\n\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    K = int(data[index + 1])\n    index += 2\n    result = find_permutation(N, K)\n    if result == -1:\n        results.append(\"-1\")\n    else:\n        results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n\nsys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the required permutation or -1 if no valid permutation exists.

The alternating sum is calculated as: add the first element, subtract the second, add the third, and so on.\n\n        2. **Strategy**: To maximize the alternating sum, we should:\n           - Sort the array in descending order.\n           - Add the largest elements and subtract the smaller ones in an alternating fashion.\n\n        ### Mistake Analysis\n\n        1. **Sorting**: The code correctly sorts the array in descending order.\n\n        2. **Alternating Sum Calculation**: The code iterates over the sorted array and alternates between adding and subtracting elements based on their index. However, the logic for determining which elements to include in the subsequence might be flawed.\n\n        3. **Subsequence Selection**: The problem allows us to choose any subsequence, not necessarily all elements. The current solution assumes that we must use all elements, which is incorrect. We should only include elements that contribute positively to the alternating sum.\n\n        ### Corrected Strategy\n\n        1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array in descending order.\n\n        2. **Calculate Alternating Sum**:\n           - Start with the first element (largest) and add it to the sum.\n           - Continue adding elements to the sum as long as they contribute positively to the alternating sum.\n           - Stop when adding another element would decrease the sum.\n\n        ### Corrected Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function calculate_max_strength(t, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                n, strengths = test_case\n                sort strengths in descending order\n                max_strength = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if i is even:\n                        max_strength += strengths[i]\n                    else:\n                        max_strength -= strengths[i]\n                    if max_strength < 0:\n                        break\n                print max_strength\n        ```\n\n        ### Corrected Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def calculate_max_strength(t, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                n, strengths = test_case\n                # Sort the strengths in descending order\n                strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n                max_strength = 0\n                # Calculate the alternating sum\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if i % 2 == 0:\n                        max_strength += strengths[i]\n                    else:\n                        max_strength -= strengths[i]\n                # Store the result for this test case\n                results.append(max_strength)\n    \n            # Print all results\n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        # Parse input\n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0 in this version\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n\n        # Calculate and print the results\n        calculate_max_strength(t, test_cases)\n        ```\n\n        This code reads input, processes each test case by sorting the strengths in descending order, calculates the maximal alternating sum by including elements in an alternating fashion, and outputs the result for each test case.

For a permutation of size N, this involves N-1 pairs.\n\n2. **Maximum Possible Value of f(P)**: The maximum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in descending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the first N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1.\n\n3. **Minimum Possible Value of f(P)**: The minimum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in ascending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the last N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N - 1) / 2).\n\n4. **Feasibility Check**: If K is less than the minimum possible value or greater than the maximum possible value, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.\n\n5. **Constructing the Permutation**: If K is feasible, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This involves swapping elements to reduce the sum from the maximum possible value to K.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K = test_case\n        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1\n        min_possible = (N * (N - 1) / 2)\n        \n        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:\n            print -1\n        else:\n            permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]\n            current_sum = max_possible\n            for i from 0 to N-2:\n                if current_sum == K:\n                    break\n                if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1]) >= K:\n                    current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1])\n                    swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]\n            print permutation\n```\n\n## Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n        min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)\n        \n        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:\n            results.append(\"-1\")\n        else:\n            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n            current_sum = max_possible\n            \n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                if current_sum == K:\n                    break\n                if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:\n                    current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])\n                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n            \n            results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n```\n\nThis code reads input, processes each test case, checks if a valid permutation is possible, constructs the permutation if feasible, and outputs the result."

This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.\n\n    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.\n\n    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.\n\n    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
