## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a number of test cases. For each test case, we have two integers, N and K. We need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair in the permutation equals K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):** 
   - For a permutation P of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair in the permutation.
   - For example, if P = [p1, p2, ..., pN], then f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

2. **Constraints and Observations:**
   - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.
   - The minimum possible value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.

3. **Approach:**
   - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

4. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - Start with the permutation [N, N-1, ..., 1].
   - Calculate the current sum of maximums.
   - If the current sum is greater than K, swap elements to reduce the sum until it equals K.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(N, K):
    max_sum = N + (N-1) + ... + 2
    min_sum = N - 1
    
    if K < min_sum or K > max_sum:
        return -1
    
    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
    current_sum = max_sum
    
    for i from 0 to N-2:
        if current_sum == K:
            break
        # Try to reduce the sum by swapping
        for j from N-1 down to i+1:
            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                swap(permutation[i], permutation[j])
                break
    
    return permutation

read T
for each test case:
    read N, K
    result = find_permutation(N, K)
    print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_permutation(N, K):
    # Calculate the maximum and minimum possible sums
    max_sum = sum(range(2, N + 1))
    min_sum = N - 1
    
    # If K is out of the possible range, return -1
    if K < min_sum or K > max_sum:
        return -1
    
    # Start with the permutation in decreasing order
    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
    current_sum = max_sum
    
    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
    for i in range(N - 1):
        if current_sum == K:
            break
        # Try to reduce the sum by swapping
        for j in range(N - 1, i, -1):
            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]
                break
    
    return permutation

import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    K = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    result = find_permutation(N, K)
    if result == -1:
        results.append("-1")
    else:
        results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))

sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the required permutation or -1 if no valid permutation exists. The function `find_permutation` constructs the permutation by starting with the maximum possible sum and adjusting it to match K.

        This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

        Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

        But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

        First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

        As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

        The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

        Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

        Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

        Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

        Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!


        -----Input-----

        Each test contains multiple test cases.

        The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

        The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

        The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

        $i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

        It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


        -----Output-----

        For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.


        -----Example-----
        Input
        3
        3 0
        1 3 2
        2 0
        1 2
        7 0
        1 2 5 4 3 6 7

        Output
        3
        2
        9



        -----Note-----

        In third test case we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be $5‚àí3+7=9$.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's carefully analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

        ### Problem Analysis

        1. **Alternating Sum**: The goal is to maximize the alternating sum of a subsequence. The alternating sum is calculated as: add the first element, subtract the second, add the third, and so on.

        2. **Strategy**: To maximize the alternating sum, we should:
           - Sort the array in descending order.
           - Add the largest elements and subtract the smaller ones in an alternating fashion.

        ### Mistake Analysis

        1. **Sorting**: The code correctly sorts the array in descending order.

        2. **Alternating Sum Calculation**: The code iterates over the sorted array and alternates between adding and subtracting elements based on their index. However, the logic for determining which elements to include in the subsequence might be flawed.

        3. **Subsequence Selection**: The problem allows us to choose any subsequence, not necessarily all elements. The current solution assumes that we must use all elements, which is incorrect. We should only include elements that contribute positively to the alternating sum.

        ### Corrected Strategy

        1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array in descending order.

        2. **Calculate Alternating Sum**:
           - Start with the first element (largest) and add it to the sum.
           - Continue adding elements to the sum as long as they contribute positively to the alternating sum.
           - Stop when adding another element would decrease the sum.

        ### Corrected Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_max_strength(t, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                n, strengths = test_case
                sort strengths in descending order
                max_strength = 0
                for i in range(n):
                    if i is even:
                        max_strength += strengths[i]
                    else:
                        max_strength -= strengths[i]
                    if max_strength < 0:
                        break
                print max_strength
        ```

        ### Corrected Python Code

        ```python
        def calculate_max_strength(t, test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                n, strengths = test_case
                # Sort the strengths in descending order
                strengths.sort(reverse=True)
                max_strength = 0
                # Calculate the alternating sum
                for i in range(n):
                    if i % 2 == 0:
                        max_strength += strengths[i]
                    else:
                        max_strength -= strengths[i]
                # Store the result for this test case
                results.append(max_strength)
    
            # Print all results
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        # Parse input
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0 in this version
            index += 2
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
            test_cases.append((n, strengths))

        # Calculate and print the results
        calculate_max_strength(t, test_cases)
        ```

        This code reads input, processes each test case by sorting the strengths in descending order, calculates the maximal alternating sum by including elements in an alternating fashion, and outputs the result for each test case. The logic now correctly handles the selection of elements to maximize the alternating sum.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's address the issue with the solution by revisiting the problem requirements and ensuring the logic aligns with the intended strategy. The key mistake was assuming that we must use all elements in the alternating sum, which is not necessary. We should only include elements that contribute positively to the alternating sum.

        Here's the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def calculate_max_strength(t, test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                n, strengths = test_case
                # Sort the strengths in descending order
                strengths.sort(reverse=True)
                max_strength = 0
                # Calculate the alternating sum
                for i in range(n):
                    if i % 2 == 0:
                        max_strength += strengths[i]
                    else:
                        max_strength -= strengths[i]
                # Store the result for this test case
                results.append(max_strength)
    
            # Print all results
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        # Parse input
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0 in this version
            index += 2
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
            test_cases.append((n, strengths))

        # Calculate and print the results
        calculate_max_strength(t, test_cases)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads all input at once and splits it into manageable parts. It then parses the number of test cases and the strengths of Pok√©mon for each test case.

        2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the strengths are sorted in descending order to maximize the alternating sum.

        3. **Alternating Sum Calculation**: The code iterates over the sorted strengths, adding and subtracting them in an alternating fashion to calculate the maximal alternating sum.

        4. **Output**: The results for each test case are stored and printed at the end.

        This solution should correctly calculate the maximal alternating sum for each test case by considering only the elements that contribute positively to the sum.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and a function f(P) that sums the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. Given N and an integer K, we need to find a permutation P such that f(P) equals K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this involves N-1 pairs.

2. **Maximum Possible Value of f(P)**: The maximum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in descending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the first N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1.

3. **Minimum Possible Value of f(P)**: The minimum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in ascending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the last N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N - 1) / 2).

4. **Feasibility Check**: If K is less than the minimum possible value or greater than the maximum possible value, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.

5. **Constructing the Permutation**: If K is feasible, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This involves swapping elements to reduce the sum from the maximum possible value to K.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case
        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
        min_possible = (N * (N - 1) / 2)
        
        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
            print -1
        else:
            permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
            current_sum = max_possible
            for i from 0 to N-2:
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1]) >= K:
                    current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1])
                    swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and a function f(P) that sums the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. Given N and an integer K, we need to find a permutation P such that f(P) equals K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this involves N-1 pairs.

2. **Maximum Possible Value of f(P)**: The maximum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in descending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the first N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1.

3. **Minimum Possible Value of f(P)**: The minimum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in ascending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the last N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N - 1) / 2).

4. **Feasibility Check**: If K is less than the minimum possible value or greater than the maximum possible value, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.

5. **Constructing the Permutation**: If K is feasible, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This involves swapping elements to reduce the sum from the maximum possible value to K.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code is designed to read from standard input and write to standard output. However, the function `find_permutation` is defined but never called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed, leading to no output.

2. **Permutation Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the permutation is based on starting with a descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This logic seems correct in principle, but it needs to be executed to verify its correctness.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for whether a permutation can achieve the desired sum K is based on comparing K with the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P). This part seems logically sound.

4. **Execution**: The main issue is that the function is not being executed, which is why no output is being produced.

To fix the problem, we need to ensure that the function is called and executed properly. Let's adjust the code to ensure it runs as expected:

```python
def find_permutation():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)
        
        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_possible
            
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:
                    current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

# Call the function to execute the logic
find_permutation()
```

### Key Changes:
- **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the function processes it as expected.
- **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.

This should address the issue of no output being produced and allow the code to be tested properly.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and a function f(P) that sums the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. Given N and an integer K, we need to find a permutation P such that f(P) equals K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this involves N-1 pairs.

2. **Maximum Possible Value of f(P)**: The maximum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in descending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the first N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1.

3. **Minimum Possible Value of f(P)**: The minimum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in ascending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the last N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N - 1) / 2).

4. **Feasibility Check**: If K is less than the minimum possible value or greater than the maximum possible value, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.

5. **Constructing the Permutation**: If K is feasible, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This involves swapping elements to reduce the sum from the maximum possible value to K.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case
        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
        min_possible = (N * (N - 1) / 2)
        
        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
            print -1
        else:
            permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
            current_sum = max_possible
            for i from 0 to N-2:
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1]) >= K:
                    current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1])
                    swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
            print permutation
```

## Final Python Code

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0

    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)
        
        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_possible
            
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:
                    current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")
```

This code reads input, processes each test case, checks if a valid permutation is possible, constructs the permutation if feasible, and outputs the result.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code is designed to read from standard input and write to standard output. However, the function `find_permutation` is defined but never called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed, leading to no output.

2. **Permutation Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the permutation is based on starting with a descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This logic seems correct in principle, but it needs to be executed to verify its correctness.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for whether a permutation can achieve the desired sum K is based on comparing K with the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P). This part seems logically sound.

4. **Execution**: The main issue is that the function is not being executed, which is why no output is being produced.

To fix the problem, we need to ensure that the function is called and executed properly. Let's adjust the code to ensure it runs as expected:

```python
def find_permutation():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)
        
        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_possible
            
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:
                    current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

# Call the function to execute the logic
find_permutation()
```

### Key Changes:
- **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the function processes it as expected.
- **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.

This should address the issue of no output being produced and allow the code to be tested properly.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Prefix Sum Optimization**: My approach used a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.

    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.

    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.

    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.

You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and a function f(P) that sums the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. Given N and an integer K, we need to find a permutation P such that f(P) equals K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this involves N-1 pairs.

2. **Maximum Possible Value of f(P)**: The maximum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in descending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the first N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1.

3. **Minimum Possible Value of f(P)**: The minimum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in ascending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the last N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N - 1) / 2).

4. **Feasibility Check**: If K is less than the minimum possible value or greater than the maximum possible value, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.

5. **Constructing the Permutation**: If K is feasible, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This involves swapping elements to reduce the sum from the maximum possible value to K.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case
        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
        min_possible = (N * (N - 1) / 2)
        
        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
            print -1
        else:
            permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
            current_sum = max_possible
            for i from 0 to N-2:
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1]) >= K:
                    current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1])
                    swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
            print permutation
```

                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")
```

This code reads input, processes each test case, checks if a valid permutation is possible, constructs the permutation if feasible, and outputs the result.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code is designed to read from standard input and write to standard output. However, the function `find_permutation` is defined but never called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed, leading to no output.

2. **Permutation Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the permutation is based on starting with a descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This logic seems correct in principle, but it needs to be executed to verify its correctness.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for whether a permutation can achieve the desired sum K is based on comparing K with the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P). This part seems logically sound.

4. **Execution**: The main issue is that the function is not being executed, which is why no output is being produced.

To fix the problem, we need to ensure that the function is called and executed properly. Let's adjust the code to ensure it runs as expected:

```python
def find_permutation():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)
        
        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_possible
            
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:
                    current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

# Call the function to execute the logic
find_permutation()
```

### Key Changes:
- **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the function processes it as expected.
- **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.

This should address the issue of no output being produced and allow the code to be tested properly.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function f(P) equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. The challenge was to determine if such a permutation exists and to construct it if possible.

### Key Concepts:
- **Function f(P)**: Understanding that f(P) is the sum of the maximums of consecutive pairs in a permutation.
- **Feasibility Check**: Calculating the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P) for a given N to quickly determine if a permutation achieving K is possible.
- **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which gives the maximum f(P)) and adjusting it to achieve the desired K by swapping elements.

### Strategies:
- **Descending Order Start**: Begin with the permutation in descending order to start with the maximum possible f(P).
- **Adjusting the Permutation**: Swap elements to reduce the sum from the maximum possible value to K, ensuring the sum decreases correctly.

### Challenges and Fixes:
- **Function Execution**: Initially, the function was defined but not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
- **Efficient I/O Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write` for efficient input and output handling, especially given the constraints on the sum of N across test cases.

The final solution efficiently checks the feasibility of achieving K and constructs the permutation if possible, handling large inputs and outputs effectively. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and efficient I/O handling in competitive programming.

For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and a function f(P) that sums the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. Given N and an integer K, we need to find a permutation P such that f(P) equals K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this involves N-1 pairs.

2. **Maximum Possible Value of f(P)**: The maximum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in descending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the first N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1.

3. **Minimum Possible Value of f(P)**: The minimum value of f(P) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in ascending order. In this case, f(P) is the sum of the last N-1 natural numbers, which is (N * (N - 1) / 2).

4. **Feasibility Check**: If K is less than the minimum possible value or greater than the maximum possible value, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.

5. **Constructing the Permutation**: If K is feasible, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This involves swapping elements to reduce the sum from the maximum possible value to K.

```

### Key Changes:
- **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the function processes it as expected.
- **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.

This should address the issue of no output being produced and allow the code to be tested properly.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this permutation problem, there are several key insights and lessons learned:

1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem involves finding a permutation of numbers that satisfies a specific sum condition. The constraints on the sum, derived from the properties of permutations, are crucial for determining if a solution is possible. The official solution effectively uses these constraints to quickly rule out impossible cases.

2. **Efficient Input/Output Handling**: Given the large potential size of input and output, efficient handling using `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` is necessary. This was a point of improvement in my initial solution, which was corrected in the final version.

3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution uses a systematic approach to construct the permutation by starting from a known configuration (ascending order) and making adjustments to reach the desired sum. This involves understanding the maximum and minimum possible values of the function f(P) and adjusting the permutation accordingly.

4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution iteratively adjusts the permutation to achieve the desired sum by swapping elements. This is a more structured approach compared to my initial attempt, which was less systematic in handling the adjustments.

5. **Edge Cases**: Handling edge cases, such as when N is 1 or when the desired sum is exactly the minimum or maximum possible, is crucial. The official solution includes specific checks for these scenarios, ensuring robustness.

Overall, the experience highlighted the importance of understanding problem constraints, efficient I/O handling, and systematic approaches to constructing solutions. These insights are valuable for tackling similar permutation and combinatorial problems in the future.

The main function is `find_permutation`.
INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] The function reads input data to determine the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers, N and K. It calculates the maximum and minimum possible sums of a permutation of numbers from 1 to N. If K is outside this range, it appends "-1" to the results. Otherwise, it starts with the permutation in descending order and attempts to adjust it to achieve the sum K by swapping adjacent elements. The results for all test cases are then printed, each on a new line.

[Problem]
    For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
    You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
    Note f([1]) = 0.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
    - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
    Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
    - 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
    - Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
    - 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    3
    4 12
    2 2
    5 14

    Output:
    -1
    1 2
    5 4 3 2 1

    -----Explanation-----
    Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
    Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
    Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.
