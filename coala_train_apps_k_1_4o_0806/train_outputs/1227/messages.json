For each test case, we are given the colors of the six sides in a specific order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. We need to determine if there are three sides that are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color. If such a set of sides exists, we output \"YES\"; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the sets of three adjacent sides on a cube. The cube has the following sets of three adjacent sides:\n1. Front, Left, Top\n2. Front, Right, Top\n3. Front, Left, Bottom\n4. Front, Right, Bottom\n5. Back, Left, Top\n6. Back, Right, Top\n7. Back, Left, Bottom\n8. Back, Right, Bottom\n\nFor each test case, we will check these sets to see if any of them have the same color on all three sides. If we find such a set, we output \"YES\"; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the number of test cases, T.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Read the six colors in the order: front, back, left, right, top, bottom.\n   - Check the following sets of three adjacent sides:\n     - (front, left, top)\n     - (front, right, top)\n     - (front, left, bottom)\n     - (front, right, bottom)\n     - (back, left, top)\n     - (back, right, top)\n     - (back, left, bottom)\n     - (back, right, bottom)\n   - If any of these sets have the same color on all three sides, output \"YES\".\n   - Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_adjacent_sides(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        front, back, left, right, top, bottom = case\n        \n        # Check all possible sets of three adjacent sides\n        if (front == left == top) or (front == right == top) or \\\n           (front == left == bottom) or (front == right == bottom) or \\\n           (back == left == top) or (back == right == top) or \\\n           (back == left == bottom) or (back == right == bottom):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().splitlines()\n\nT = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = [line.split() for line in data[1:T+1]]\n\n# Get results\nresults = check_adjacent_sides(T, test_cases)\n\n# Output results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes each test case to check for three adjacent sides with the same color, and outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly."

The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.\n\n    #### Key Insights and Strategies\n\n    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.\n\n    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N = test_case[0]\n            A = test_case[1]\n        \n            current_sum = 0\n            possible = True\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                current_sum += A[i]\n                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n        \n            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Specifically, it requires identifying sets of three adjacent sides that form a corner and checking if they are painted the same color. The key is to correctly map the indices of the cube's sides to these adjacent sets.\n\n#### Strategies and Errors\nInitially, the solution correctly identified the sets of adjacent sides using the indices:\n- Front, Left, Top: indices 0, 2, 4\n- Front, Right, Top: indices 0, 3, 4\n- Back, Left, Bottom: indices 1, 2, 5\n- Back, Right, Bottom: indices 1, 3, 5\n\nDespite this, the solution failed to produce the correct output due to a misunderstanding of the input processing or logical errors in the condition checks. The repeated attempts did not address the core issue, which was likely related to how the input was being parsed or how the conditions were evaluated.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n- **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is parsed correctly. Misreading the input format can lead to incorrect results.\n- **Logical Conditions**: Double-check the logical conditions used to evaluate the problem's requirements. Even if the indices are correct, the logic must be applied correctly.\n- **Debugging**: When a solution doesn't work as expected, break down the problem and verify each part of the logic and input handling separately.\n\nIn future problems, it will be crucial to verify both the input handling and the logical conditions thoroughly to ensure they align with the problem's requirements."

The challenge lies in correctly identifying the sets of adjacent sides and checking their colors.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Adjacency Sets**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent all possible sets of three adjacent sides on a cube. This is a comprehensive approach that ensures all possible combinations are checked.\n\n2. **Indexing**: The solution uses 1-based indexing in the tuples, which is adjusted by subtracting 1 when accessing the list of colors. This is a small but crucial detail that ensures the correct sides are being compared.\n\n3. **Set for Uniqueness**: The use of a set to check if all three sides in a tuple have the same color is efficient. If the length of the set is 1, it means all three sides are the same color.\n\n4. **Early Exit**: The solution breaks out of the loop as soon as a matching set is found, which is efficient and reduces unnecessary checks.\n\n### Why My Approach Failed\n\nMy approach failed because I incorrectly identified the sets of adjacent sides. I assumed only four specific sets of sides, but the official solution considers all possible combinations of three adjacent sides. This oversight led to incorrect results for some test cases.\n\n### Learning Points\n\n- **Comprehensive Checking**: When dealing with geometric problems, ensure all possible configurations are considered. The official solution's use of a list of tuples to represent all adjacency sets is a robust approach.\n\n- **Indexing**: Pay attention to indexing, especially when converting between 1-based and 0-based systems.\n\n- **Efficiency**: Using data structures like sets to check for uniqueness can simplify the logic and improve efficiency.\n\nThis experience highlights the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem's geometric constraints and ensuring all possible configurations are considered in the solution."
