INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... and need to find the N'th number in this series for multiple test cases. The series is defined by a specific pattern, and we need to determine this pattern to compute the N'th term efficiently.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   - By examining the differences between consecutive terms, we can identify a pattern:
     - 1 - 0 = 1
     - 5 - 1 = 4
     - 14 - 5 = 9
     - 30 - 14 = 16
     - 55 - 30 = 25
   - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

2. **Formulate the Series**:
   - The N'th term can be expressed as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.
   - The formula for the N'th term is: `S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (N-1)^2`.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Use the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
   - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term in constant time.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula and output the result.

## Pseudocode

```
function sum_of_squares(n):
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) // 6

function find_nth_term(N):
    if N == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return sum_of_squares(N-1)

read T
for each test case:
    read N
    result = find_nth_term(N)
    print result
```

## Python Code

```python
def sum_of_squares(n):
    # Calculate the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6

def find_nth_term(N):
    # If N is 1, the term is 0
    if N == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        # Otherwise, calculate the sum of squares up to (N-1)
        return sum_of_squares(N - 1)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = find_nth_term(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

main()
```

This code reads input from standard input, computes the N'th term for each test case using the derived formula, and outputs the results. The use of the sum of squares formula ensures that each term is computed efficiently in constant time.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Pattern Generation Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. The pattern for each test case consists of `K` lines, where each line `i` (0-indexed) should display numbers from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `1` up to `i`. This requires understanding how to manipulate loops to generate sequences in both ascending and descending order.

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the logic for generating the pattern was incorrect. The mistake was in the sequence generation, where the numbers were not being appended in the correct order. The expected pattern was misunderstood, leading to incorrect outputs. The key realization was that each line should start with a descending sequence from `i` to `0` and then an ascending sequence from `1` to `i`.

    Another issue was with the output formatting. The solution initially added extra newlines between test cases, which was not required. This was fixed by carefully managing the output to ensure that test cases are separated correctly without trailing newlines.

    #### Correct Solution
    The final solution correctly implements the pattern generation by:
    - Using nested loops to construct each line of the pattern.
    - Ensuring the correct order of numbers for each line.
    - Managing the output format to match the expected results without extra newlines.

    Here is the corrected code snippet:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for K in test_cases:
            pattern = []
            for i in range(K):
                line = ""
                # Append numbers from i down to 0
                for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                    line += str(j)
                # Append numbers from 1 up to i
                for j in range(1, i + 1):
                    line += str(j)
                pattern.append(line)
            results.append("\n".join(pattern))
        # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases
        print("\n\n".join(results))

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and carefully managing output formatting in competitive programming problems.

   - These differences are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

2. **Formulate the Series**:
   - The N'th term can be calculated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.
   - The formula for the N'th term is: `S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (N-1)^2`.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

### Key Concepts and Patterns:
- The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.
- The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.

### Strategy:
- I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.
- This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).

### Implementation:
- I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.
- The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.

This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the N'th number in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... Given a number of test cases, each with a single integer N, we need to output the N'th number in this series.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   - The differences between consecutive terms are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
   - These differences are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

2. **Formulate the Series**:
   - The N'th term can be calculated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.
   - The formula for the N'th term is: `S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (N-1)^2`.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Use the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.

4. **Implementation**:
   - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula and output the result.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_nth_term(N):
    return (N-1) * N * (2*N-1) // 6

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = calculate_nth_term(N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def calculate_nth_term(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
    return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = calculate_nth_term(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
main()
```

This solution efficiently calculates the N'th term in the series for each test case using the sum of squares formula, ensuring it handles up to 10,000 test cases and values of N efficiently.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    n=int(input())
    if n==1:
        print("0")
    else:
        n=n-2
        l=(n+1)*(2*n+3)*(n+2)/6
        print(int(l))


INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:

1. **Formula Derivation**:
   - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
   - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.

2. **Handling the First Term**:
   - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.

4. **Code Simplicity**:
   - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.

Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.
