    "summary": "In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n- The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.\n- The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n\n### Strategy:\n- I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.\n- This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).\n\n### Implementation:\n- I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.\n- The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.",
    "reflection": "The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:\n\n1. **Formula Derivation**:\n   - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n   - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.\n\n2. **Handling the First Term**:\n   - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.\n\n3. **Efficiency**:\n   - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.\n\n4. **Code Simplicity**:\n   - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.\n\nOverall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases, followed by T integers. For each integer N, it calculates the N'th term using a specific formula and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to generate or identify terms in a specific mathematical series, particularly one that involves a pattern based on the sum of squares. The problem demonstrates how to derive a formula for the N'th term of a series and efficiently compute it for large inputs, which is common in competitive programming and algorithm design. Understanding this pattern can help in solving similar problems where a sequence is defined by a mathematical formula, especially when dealing with constraints that require efficient computation."
