    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to solve a problem where we are given multiple test cases. For each test case, we have a sequence of numbers. For each number in the sequence, we need to find its largest prime factor. Then, we need to determine which of these largest prime factors appears most frequently. If there is a tie, we should return the largest prime factor among the most frequent ones.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**: For each number in the sequence, determine its largest prime factor.\n2. **Frequency Count**: Count the frequency of each largest prime factor across the sequence.\n3. **Determine Result**: Identify the prime factor with the highest frequency. If there is a tie, choose the largest prime factor.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Precompute the largest prime factor for every number up to 100,000 using a sieve-like approach.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Initialize a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of largest prime factors.\n   - For each number in the sequence, retrieve its largest prime factor and update the frequency dictionary.\n   - Determine the prime factor with the maximum frequency. In case of a tie, choose the largest prime factor.\n3. Output the result for each test case.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef precompute_largest_prime_factors(max_num):\n    # Array to store the largest prime factor for each number\n    largest_prime_factor = [0] * (max_num + 1)\n    \n    # Sieve-like approach to fill the largest prime factor\n    for i in range(2, max_num + 1):\n        if largest_prime_factor[i] == 0:  # i is a prime number\n            for j in range(i, max_num + 1, i):\n                largest_prime_factor[j] = i\n    \n    return largest_prime_factor\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    max_num = 100000\n    largest_prime_factor = precompute_largest_prime_factors(max_num)\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        sequence = map(int, data[index:index + N])\n        index += N\n        \n        # Dictionary to count frequency of largest prime factors\n        frequency = {}\n        \n        for number in sequence:\n            lpf = largest_prime_factor[number]\n            if lpf in frequency:\n                frequency[lpf] += 1\n            else:\n                frequency[lpf] = 1\n        \n        # Find the prime factor with the maximum frequency\n        max_frequency = 0\n        result_prime = 0\n        \n        for prime, freq in frequency.items():\n            if freq > max_frequency or (freq == max_frequency and prime > result_prime):\n                max_frequency = freq\n                result_prime = prime\n        \n        results.append(result_prime)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Precomputation**: We use a sieve-like method to precompute the largest prime factor for every number up to 100,000. This allows us to quickly retrieve the largest prime factor for any number in the input.\n- **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, we count the occurrences of each largest prime factor using a dictionary.\n- **Determine the Result**: We iterate over the frequency dictionary to find the prime factor with the highest frequency, resolving ties by choosing the largest prime factor.\n- **Output**: We print the result for each test case.",
