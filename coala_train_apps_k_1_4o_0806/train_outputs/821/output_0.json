    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Our task is to color each interval either blue or yellow such that the length of the X-axis that is covered by both blue and yellow intervals (i.e., the green part) is maximized. We need to output a string for each test case, where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval: '0' for blue and '1' for yellow.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green part is formed where intervals overlap and are colored differently. To maximize the green part, we should aim to color overlapping intervals with different colors.\n\n2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in easily identifying overlapping intervals.\n\n3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color the intervals:\n   - Traverse through the sorted intervals.\n   - For each interval, check if it overlaps with the previous one.\n   - If it overlaps, color it differently than the previous interval to maximize the green part.\n   - If it doesn't overlap, you can choose any color, but for simplicity, alternate colors.\n\n4. **Output**: For each test case, output the string representing the colors of the intervals.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction maximizeGreen(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        intervals = test_case.intervals\n        sort intervals by starting point L_i\n        result = \"\"\n        previous_color = None\n        \n        for i in range(len(intervals)):\n            if i == 0:\n                color = '0'  # Start with blue\n            else:\n                if intervals[i] overlaps with intervals[i-1]:\n                    color = '1' if previous_color == '0' else '0'\n                else:\n                    color = '0'  # Reset to blue for non-overlapping\n            \n            result += color\n            previous_color = color\n        \n        print(result)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef maximizeGreen(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        # Sort intervals by their starting point\n        intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n        result = [''] * len(intervals)\n        previous_color = None\n        \n        for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n            if i == 0:\n                color = '0'  # Start with blue\n            else:\n                _, (prev_L, prev_R) = intervals[i-1]\n                if L <= prev_R:  # Check if current interval overlaps with the previous\n                    color = '1' if previous_color == '0' else '0'\n                else:\n                    color = '0'  # Reset to blue for non-overlapping\n            \n            result[index] = color\n            previous_color = color\n        \n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 1\n# test_cases = [\n#     [(3, 7), (2, 5), (6, 9)]\n# ]\n# maximizeGreen(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution sorts the intervals by their starting points and uses a greedy approach to color them, ensuring that overlapping intervals are colored differently to maximize the green part. The results are collected and printed for each test case.",
