The data is split into a list of strings for easy access.\n- **Sorting and Coloring**: The intervals are sorted by their starting points. A greedy approach is used to color overlapping intervals differently to maximize the green part.\n- **Output**: The results for each test case are collected in a list and printed at the end, ensuring that each test case's result is output on a new line.\n\nThis code should now correctly handle the input and output as expected in a competitive programming environment.",
