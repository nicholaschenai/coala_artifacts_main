Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:\n- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval\n- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.\n- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.\n- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.\nYou want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs when a part of the X-axis is covered by at least one blue interval and at least one yellow interval. We need to determine a coloring strategy for each test case that maximizes the green length.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green color appears where blue and yellow intervals overlap. Therefore, to maximize the green length, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible between blue and yellow intervals.\n\n2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.\n\n3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color the intervals:\n   - Iterate through the sorted intervals.\n   - Maintain a running track of the current end of the blue and yellow intervals.\n   - For each interval, decide whether to color it blue or yellow based on which choice would result in more overlap with the other color.\n\n4. **Decision Making**: \n   - If the current interval starts after the end of the last blue interval, color it yellow.\n   - If the current interval starts after the end of the last yellow interval, color it blue.\n   - If it overlaps with both, choose the color that maximizes the overlap with the other color.\n\n5. **Output**: For each test case, output a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        intervals = test_case.intervals\n        sort intervals by starting point\n        blue_end = -1\n        yellow_end = -1\n        coloring = []\n        for each interval in intervals:\n            if interval.start > blue_end:\n                color it yellow\n                update yellow_end\n            elif interval.start > yellow_end:\n                color it blue\n                update blue_end\n            else:\n                choose color to maximize overlap\n                update respective end\n            append color to coloring\n        append coloring to results\n    return results\n```\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        # Sort intervals by their starting point\n        intervals.sort()\n        \n        # Initialize the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals\n        blue_end = -1\n        yellow_end = -1\n        \n        # This will store the coloring result for the current test case\n        coloring = []\n        \n        for L, R in intervals:\n            if L > blue_end:\n                # If the current interval starts after the last blue interval ends, color it yellow\n                coloring.append('1')\n                yellow_end = max(yellow_end, R)\n            elif L > yellow_end:\n                # If the current interval starts after the last yellow interval ends, color it blue\n                coloring.append('0')\n                blue_end = max(blue_end, R)\n            else:\n                # If it overlaps with both, choose the color that maximizes overlap\n                if blue_end - L < yellow_end - L:\n                    coloring.append('0')\n                    blue_end = max(blue_end, R)\n                else:\n                    coloring.append('1')\n                    yellow_end = max(yellow_end, R)\n        \n        # Append the result for this test case\n        results.append(''.join(coloring))\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nindex = 0\nT = int(data[index])\nindex += 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    intervals = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        L = int(data[index])\n        R = int(data[index + 1])\n        intervals.append((L, R))\n        index += 2\n    test_cases.append(intervals)\n\n# Get results\nresults = maximize_green(T, test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case to determine the optimal coloring strategy, and outputs the result for each test case.

The idea is to always try to fill a box with as many ducks of a single color as possible, and then use a second color if needed. This ensures that each box is filled optimally with respect to the constraints.\n\n    2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution handles edge cases, such as when there are exactly two colors and specific constraints on `N` and `K`, by using a dictionary to map the original indices of colors. This ensures that the output format is consistent with the expected results.\n\n    3. **Iterative Filling**: The solution iteratively fills each box by checking the available ducks of each color and adjusting the counts accordingly. This is done in a loop until all boxes are filled, ensuring that the constraints are met.\n\n    ### Why the Official Solution Works\n\n    - **Correct Logic**: The official solution correctly implements the logic to fill each box with at most two colors, ensuring that the total number of ducks in each box is exactly `K`.\n    - **Output Consistency**: By maintaining a mapping of original indices, the solution ensures that the output format is consistent with the expected results, which was a point of failure in my previous attempts.\n    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints by using a simple loop and condition checks, making it suitable for large input sizes.\n\n    ### Learnings\n\n    - **Importance of Output Format**: Ensuring that the output format matches the expected results is crucial, especially in competitive programming. This includes maintaining the order of colors and ensuring the correct number of ducks per color.\n    - **Iterative Problem Solving**: Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and iteratively solving each part can lead to a more robust solution.\n    - **Handling Edge Cases**: Always consider edge cases and special conditions in the problem statement to ensure the solution is comprehensive.\n\n    In summary, the official solution provides a clear and efficient approach to solving the problem by focusing on a greedy strategy and maintaining output consistency. This experience highlights the importance of careful problem analysis and iterative solution development.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This approach worked well because it efficiently handled the constraints and ensured the correct output format.\n\nKey takeaways include the importance of handling input/output correctly in competitive programming and the effectiveness of greedy algorithms in problems involving interval overlaps. The experience reinforced the need to carefully manage function execution and input parsing in environments where the input is provided in bulk."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses a straightforward approach to read input directly within the loop for each test case. This is efficient for competitive programming as it minimizes the overhead of managing input data separately.\n\n2. **Sorting and Indexing**: Both my solution and the official solution sort the intervals by their starting points. This is crucial for efficiently determining overlaps and deciding the coloring strategy.\n\n3. **Greedy Coloring Strategy**: The official solution uses a clever approach to manage the coloring:\n   - It maintains a `maxi` variable to track the maximum endpoint of the intervals processed so far.\n   - It uses a bitwise XOR operation (`c ^= 1`) to toggle the color when necessary, which is a concise way to alternate between two states (0 and 1).\n   - The solution checks if the current interval can be colored with the same color as the previous non-overlapping interval or if it needs to toggle the color to maximize the green area.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity. It processes each interval in linear time relative to the number of intervals, and it uses a constant amount of additional space for variables like `maxi` and `c`.\n\n5. **Output**: The official solution directly prints the result for each test case, which is a common practice in competitive programming to ensure fast output.\n\nOverall, the official solution is insightful in its use of a simple yet effective greedy strategy combined with efficient input/output handling. The use of bitwise operations for toggling colors is a neat trick that simplifies the logic. This experience reinforces the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient coding practices in competitive programming."

For each test case, it sorts the intervals by their starting points and assigns a color ('0' or '1') to each interval, ensuring that overlapping intervals have different colors. The function starts with the color '0' and alternates colors for overlapping intervals, resetting to '0' for non-overlapping intervals. It constructs a result string for each test case, representing the color assigned to each interval in the original order, and prints these results.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to maximize the overlap of two sets of intervals on a line, such as in scheduling problems where you want to maximize shared resources or in computational geometry where overlapping regions need to be identified. The problem involves sorting intervals and strategically coloring them to maximize overlap, which is a common technique in interval problems. This approach can be applied to any situation where intervals need to be managed or optimized for overlap, such as network bandwidth allocation, event planning, or resource sharing in distributed systems."
