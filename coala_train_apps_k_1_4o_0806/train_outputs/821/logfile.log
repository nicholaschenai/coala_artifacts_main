## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Each interval can be colored either blue or yellow. The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs when a part of the X-axis is covered by at least one blue interval and at least one yellow interval. We need to determine a coloring strategy for each test case that maximizes the green length.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green color appears where blue and yellow intervals overlap. Therefore, to maximize the green length, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible between blue and yellow intervals.

2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.

3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color the intervals:
   - Iterate through the sorted intervals.
   - Maintain a running track of the current end of the blue and yellow intervals.
   - For each interval, decide whether to color it blue or yellow based on which choice would result in more overlap with the other color.

4. **Decision Making**: 
   - If the current interval starts after the end of the last blue interval, color it yellow.
   - If the current interval starts after the end of the last yellow interval, color it blue.
   - If it overlaps with both, choose the color that maximizes the overlap with the other color.

5. **Output**: For each test case, output a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.

## Pseudocode

```
function maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case.intervals
        sort intervals by starting point
        blue_end = -1
        yellow_end = -1
        coloring = []
        for each interval in intervals:
            if interval.start > blue_end:
                color it yellow
                update yellow_end
            elif interval.start > yellow_end:
                color it blue
                update blue_end
            else:
                choose color to maximize overlap
                update respective end
            append color to coloring
        append coloring to results
    return results
```

## Python Solution

```python
def maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for intervals in test_cases:
        # Sort intervals by their starting point
        intervals.sort()
        
        # Initialize the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals
        blue_end = -1
        yellow_end = -1
        
        # This will store the coloring result for the current test case
        coloring = []
        
        for L, R in intervals:
            if L > blue_end:
                # If the current interval starts after the last blue interval ends, color it yellow
                coloring.append('1')
                yellow_end = max(yellow_end, R)
            elif L > yellow_end:
                # If the current interval starts after the last yellow interval ends, color it blue
                coloring.append('0')
                blue_end = max(blue_end, R)
            else:
                # If it overlaps with both, choose the color that maximizes overlap
                if blue_end - L < yellow_end - L:
                    coloring.append('0')
                    blue_end = max(blue_end, R)
                else:
                    coloring.append('1')
                    yellow_end = max(yellow_end, R)
        
        # Append the result for this test case
        results.append(''.join(coloring))
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
index = 0
T = int(data[index])
index += 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    intervals = []
    for _ in range(n):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        intervals.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append(intervals)

# Get results
results = maximize_green(T, test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case to determine the optimal coloring strategy, and outputs the result for each test case. The approach is efficient and adheres to the constraints provided.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:

    ### Key Insights

    1. **Greedy Approach**: The problem can be effectively solved using a greedy approach. The idea is to always try to fill a box with as many ducks of a single color as possible, and then use a second color if needed. This ensures that each box is filled optimally with respect to the constraints.

    2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution handles edge cases, such as when there are exactly two colors and specific constraints on `N` and `K`, by using a dictionary to map the original indices of colors. This ensures that the output format is consistent with the expected results.

    3. **Iterative Filling**: The solution iteratively fills each box by checking the available ducks of each color and adjusting the counts accordingly. This is done in a loop until all boxes are filled, ensuring that the constraints are met.

    ### Why the Official Solution Works

    - **Correct Logic**: The official solution correctly implements the logic to fill each box with at most two colors, ensuring that the total number of ducks in each box is exactly `K`.
    - **Output Consistency**: By maintaining a mapping of original indices, the solution ensures that the output format is consistent with the expected results, which was a point of failure in my previous attempts.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints by using a simple loop and condition checks, making it suitable for large input sizes.

    ### Learnings

    - **Importance of Output Format**: Ensuring that the output format matches the expected results is crucial, especially in competitive programming. This includes maintaining the order of colors and ensuring the correct number of ducks per color.
    - **Iterative Problem Solving**: Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and iteratively solving each part can lead to a more robust solution.
    - **Handling Edge Cases**: Always consider edge cases and special conditions in the problem statement to ensure the solution is comprehensive.

    In summary, the official solution provides a clear and efficient approach to solving the problem by focusing on a greedy strategy and maintaining output consistency. This experience highlights the importance of careful problem analysis and iterative solution development.

Our task is to color each interval either blue or yellow such that the length of the X-axis that is covered by both blue and yellow intervals (i.e., the green part) is maximized. We need to output a string for each test case, where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval: '0' for blue and '1' for yellow.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Our task is to color each interval either blue or yellow such that the length of the X-axis that is covered by both blue and yellow intervals (i.e., the green part) is maximized. We need to output a string for each test case, where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval: '0' for blue and '1' for yellow.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green part is formed where intervals overlap and are colored differently. To maximize the green part, we should aim to color overlapping intervals with different colors.

2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in easily identifying overlapping intervals.

3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color the intervals:
   - Traverse through the sorted intervals.
   - For each interval, check if it overlaps with the previous one.
   - If it overlaps, color it differently than the previous interval to maximize the green part.
   - If it doesn't overlap, you can choose any color, but for simplicity, alternate colors.

4. **Output**: For each test case, output the string representing the colors of the intervals.

## Pseudocode

```
function maximizeGreen(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case.intervals
        sort intervals by starting point L_i
        result = ""
        previous_color = None
        
        for i in range(len(intervals)):
            if i == 0:
                color = '0'  # Start with blue
            else:
                if intervals[i] overlaps with intervals[i-1]:
                    color = '1' if previous_color == '0' else '0'
                else:
                    color = '0'  # Reset to blue for non-overlapping
            
            result += color
            previous_color = color
        
        print(result)

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from and writing to standard input/output. The function `maximizeGreen` is defined but not called, and the input is not being read from standard input.

        results.append(''.join(result))
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings for easy access.
- **Function Execution**: The function `maximizeGreen` is now self-contained and reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the result.
- **Output**: The results are collected in a list and printed at the end, ensuring that each test case's result is output on a new line.

This should address the issues and ensure the solution works correctly in a competitive programming environment.

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings for easy access.
- **Function Execution**: The function `maximizeGreen` is now self-contained and reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the result.
- **Output**: The results are collected in a list and printed at the end, ensuring that each test case's result is output on a new line.

This should address the issues and ensure the solution works correctly in a competitive programming environment.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their scores are multiplied by the complexity factor for questions they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it correctly is crucial in competitive programming.
    - **Zero-based Indexing**: Converting input indices to zero-based for easier array manipulation in Python.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Efficient Input Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then parsing it was effective for handling large input sizes.
    - **Iterative Updates**: Iterating over the specified range for each question and updating scores directly was straightforward and worked well within the constraints.

    ### Fixes and Learnings:
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is executed is a basic but crucial step.
    - **Output Verification**: Ensuring that results are printed correctly after processing all test cases was necessary to match expected outputs.

    This problem reinforced the importance of efficient input handling and careful index management in array-based problems. It also highlighted the need to ensure that the main logic is executed by calling the appropriate functions.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Our task is to color each interval either blue or yellow such that the length of the X-axis that is covered by both blue and yellow intervals (i.e., the green part) is maximized. We need to output a string for each test case, where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval: '0' for blue and '1' for yellow.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green part is formed where intervals overlap and are colored differently. To maximize the green part, we should aim to color overlapping intervals with different colors.

2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in easily identifying overlapping intervals.

3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color the intervals:
   - Traverse through the sorted intervals.
   - For each interval, check if it overlaps with the previous one.
   - If it overlaps, color it differently than the previous interval to maximize the green part.
   - If it doesn't overlap, you can choose any color, but for simplicity, alternate colors.

4. **Output**: For each test case, output the string representing the colors of the intervals.

## Pseudocode

```
function maximizeGreen(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case.intervals
        sort intervals by starting point L_i
        result = ""
        previous_color = None
        
        for i in range(len(intervals)):
            if i == 0:
                color = '0'  # Start with blue
            else:
                if intervals[i] overlaps with intervals[i-1]:
                    color = '1' if previous_color == '0' else '0'
                else:
                    color = '0'  # Reset to blue for non-overlapping
            
            result += color
            previous_color = color
        
        print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def maximizeGreen(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for intervals in test_cases:
        # Sort intervals by their starting point
        intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])
        result = [''] * len(intervals)
        previous_color = None
        
        for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):
            if i == 0:
                color = '0'  # Start with blue
            else:
                _, (prev_L, prev_R) = intervals[i-1]
                if L <= prev_R:  # Check if current interval overlaps with the previous
                    color = '1' if previous_color == '0' else '0'
                else:
                    color = '0'  # Reset to blue for non-overlapping
            
            result[index] = color
            previous_color = color
        
        results.append(''.join(result))
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [
#     [(3, 7), (2, 5), (6, 9)]
# ]
# maximizeGreen(T, test_cases)
```

This solution sorts the intervals by their starting points and uses a greedy approach to color them, ensuring that overlapping intervals are colored differently to maximize the green part. The results are collected and printed for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from and writing to standard input/output. The function `maximizeGreen` is defined but not called, and the input is not being read from standard input.

2. **Function Call**: The function `maximizeGreen` is defined but not executed. In a competitive programming environment, the function should be called with the appropriate input.

3. **Reading Input**: The input should be read from standard input, especially since the problem specifies that the input will be provided in a specific format.

4. **Output**: The results should be printed directly to standard output, which is not happening in the current setup.

5. **Sorting and Indexing**: The solution sorts the intervals and uses the original indices to construct the result string. This part seems correct, but we need to ensure that the sorting and coloring logic is correctly implemented.

Let's correct these issues by ensuring the function is called, input is read from standard input, and output is printed to standard output.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to color intervals on the X-axis to maximize the length of the green part, which is formed by overlapping intervals colored differently. The core concept here is to use a greedy strategy to alternate colors for overlapping intervals, ensuring maximum overlap is colored green.

Initially, the solution failed due to incorrect input/output handling. The function was defined but not executed, and input was not read from standard input, which is crucial in competitive programming environments. The fix involved using `sys.stdin.read()` to handle input efficiently and ensuring the function was called to process the input and produce the output.

The successful strategy involved sorting the intervals by their starting points and using a greedy approach to color them. By checking overlaps with the previous interval and alternating colors, we ensured that the green part was maximized. This approach worked well because it efficiently handled the constraints and ensured the correct output format.

Key takeaways include the importance of handling input/output correctly in competitive programming and the effectiveness of greedy algorithms in problems involving interval overlaps. The experience reinforced the need to carefully manage function execution and input parsing in environments where the input is provided in bulk.

The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions

- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Our task is to color each interval either blue or yellow such that the length of the X-axis that is covered by both blue and yellow intervals (i.e., the green part) is maximized. We need to output a string for each test case, where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval: '0' for blue and '1' for yellow.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green part is formed where intervals overlap and are colored differently. To maximize the green part, we should aim to color overlapping intervals with different colors.

2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in easily identifying overlapping intervals.

3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color the intervals:
   - Traverse through the sorted intervals.
   - For each interval, check if it overlaps with the previous one.
   - If it overlaps, color it differently than the previous interval to maximize the green part.
   - If it doesn't overlap, you can choose any color, but for simplicity, alternate colors.

4. **Output**: For each test case, output the string representing the colors of the intervals.

## Pseudocode

```
function maximizeGreen(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case.intervals
        sort intervals by starting point L_i
        result = ""
        previous_color = None
        
        for i in range(len(intervals)):
            if i == 0:
                color = '0'  # Start with blue
            else:
                if intervals[i] overlaps with intervals[i-1]:
                    color = '1' if previous_color == '0' else '0'
                else:
                    color = '0'  # Reset to blue for non-overlapping
            
            result += color
            previous_color = color
        
        print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def maximizeGreen(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for intervals in test_cases:
        # Sort intervals by their starting point
        intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])
        result = [''] * len(intervals)
        previous_color = None
        
        for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):
            if i == 0:
                color = '0'  # Start with blue
            else:
                _, (prev_L, prev_R) = intervals[i-1]
                if L <= prev_R:  # Check if current interval overlaps with the previous
                    color = '1' if previous_color == '0' else '0'
                else:
                    color = '0'  # Reset to blue for non-overlapping
            
            result[index] = color
            previous_color = color
        
        results.append(''.join(result))
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [
#     [(3, 7), (2, 5), (6, 9)]
# ]
# maximizeGreen(T, test_cases)
```

This solution sorts the intervals by their starting points and uses a greedy approach to color them, ensuring that overlapping intervals are colored differently to maximize the green part. The results are collected and printed for each test case.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from and writing to standard input/output. The function `maximizeGreen` is defined but not called, and the input is not being read from standard input.

2. **Function Call**: The function `maximizeGreen` is defined but not executed. In a competitive programming environment, the function should be called with the appropriate input.

3. **Reading Input**: The input should be read from standard input, especially since the problem specifies that the input will be provided in a specific format.

4. **Output**: The results should be printed directly to standard output, which is not happening in the current setup.

5. **Sorting and Indexing**: The solution sorts the intervals and uses the original indices to construct the result string. This part seems correct, but we need to ensure that the sorting and coloring logic is correctly implemented.

Let's correct these issues by ensuring the function is called, input is read from standard input, and output is printed to standard output.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses a straightforward approach to read input directly within the loop for each test case. This is efficient for competitive programming as it minimizes the overhead of managing input data separately.

2. **Sorting and Indexing**: Both my solution and the official solution sort the intervals by their starting points. This is crucial for efficiently determining overlaps and deciding the coloring strategy.

3. **Greedy Coloring Strategy**: The official solution uses a clever approach to manage the coloring:
   - It maintains a `maxi` variable to track the maximum endpoint of the intervals processed so far.
   - It uses a bitwise XOR operation (`c ^= 1`) to toggle the color when necessary, which is a concise way to alternate between two states (0 and 1).
   - The solution checks if the current interval can be colored with the same color as the previous non-overlapping interval or if it needs to toggle the color to maximize the green area.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity. It processes each interval in linear time relative to the number of intervals, and it uses a constant amount of additional space for variables like `maxi` and `c`.

5. **Output**: The official solution directly prints the result for each test case, which is a common practice in competitive programming to ensure fast output.

Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of a simple yet effective greedy strategy combined with efficient input/output handling. The use of bitwise operations for toggling colors is a neat trick that simplifies the logic. This experience reinforces the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient coding practices in competitive programming.

maximizeGreen()


The main function is `maximizeGreen`.
INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] The function reads input data representing multiple test cases, each containing a number of intervals defined by their start and end points. For each test case, it sorts the intervals by their starting points and assigns a color ('0' or '1') to each interval, ensuring that overlapping intervals have different colors. The function starts with the color '0' and alternates colors for overlapping intervals, resetting to '0' for non-overlapping intervals. It constructs a result string for each test case, representing the color assigned to each interval in the original order, and prints these results.

[Problem]
    You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
    - White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
    - Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
    - Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
    - Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
    You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
    - The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

    -----Output:-----
    For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
    - $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
    - The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
    - $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    3
    3 7
    2 5
    6 9

    -----Sample Output:-----
    100

    -----Explanation:-----
    The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
    - $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
    - $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
    - $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
    - Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
    Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
    Note that 011 is also a valid output.
