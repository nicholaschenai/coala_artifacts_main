        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.\n\n## Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a prefix sum approach with a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of the number of times a particular prefix sum has occurred. The idea is to iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum (prefix sum). For each element, we check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current running sum, equals `k`. If such a prefix sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We count all such subarrays. We also update the hash map with the current prefix sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0\n   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle cases where subarray starts from index 0\n   Initialize `current_sum` to 0\n   Initialize `count` to 0\n\n   For each number `num` in `nums`:\n       Add `num` to `current_sum`\n       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`\n       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:\n           Add the count of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`\n       Increment the count of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`\n\n   Return `count`\n   ```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums\n        prefix_sum_count = {0: 1}\n        current_sum = 0\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each number in the array\n        for num in nums:\n            # Update the current prefix sum\n            current_sum += num\n            \n            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k\n            needed_sum = current_sum - k\n            \n            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are\n            # subarrays ending at the current index which sum to k\n            if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:\n                count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]\n            \n            # Update the prefix_sum_count with the current prefix sum\n            if current_sum in prefix_sum_count:\n                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1\n            else:\n                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] = 1\n        \n        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum equal to k\n        return count\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a prefix sum approach with a hash map to track the frequency of prefix sums. This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array."

We need to find the number of continuous subarrays (subsequences of consecutive elements) in `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. \n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify the positions of odd numbers in the array. This will help us in determining the subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.\n\n        2. **Use Two Pointers**: We can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. The idea is to maintain a window that contains exactly `k` odd numbers and count the number of such windows.\n\n        3. **Count Subarrays**: For each valid window (subarray) that contains exactly `k` odd numbers, we can extend the window to the left and right to count all possible subarrays that still contain exactly `k` odd numbers.\n\n        4. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the array, adjusting the window size using the two pointers, and count the number of valid subarrays.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start of the array.\n        2. Initialize a counter `odd_count` to count the number of odd numbers in the current window.\n        3. Initialize a variable `result` to store the number of nice subarrays.\n        4. Iterate `right` over the array:\n           - If `nums[right]` is odd, increment `odd_count`.\n           - While `odd_count` is greater than `k`, increment `left` and decrement `odd_count` if `nums[left]` is odd.\n           - If `odd_count` equals `k`, count the number of subarrays ending at `right` with exactly `k` odd numbers.\n        5.

This approach is both efficient and elegant, leveraging the properties of prefix sums to quickly determine the number of subarrays that meet the criteria.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Prefix Sum and Hashmap**: The use of a prefix sum allows us to keep a running total of the sum of elements up to the current index. By storing these sums in a hashmap, we can efficiently check if there exists a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, equals `k`. This indicates the presence of a subarray summing to `k`.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The hashmap is initialized with `{0: 1}` to handle cases where a subarray starting from the beginning of the array sums to `k`. This ensures that we correctly count subarrays that start at the first element.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element is processed once, and hashmap operations (insertion and lookup) are average O(1).\n\n4. **Comparison with My Solution**: The official solution is essentially the same as the one I provided, confirming the correctness and efficiency of the approach.
