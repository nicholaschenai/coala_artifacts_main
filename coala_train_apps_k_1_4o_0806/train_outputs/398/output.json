    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the total number of continuous subarrays within `nums` whose sum equals `k`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Use a HashMap for Prefix Sums**: We can use a hashmap to store the cumulative sum (prefix sum) up to each index. This will help us quickly find the number of subarrays that sum to `k`.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Array**: As we iterate through the array, we maintain a running sum of the elements. For each element, we check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current running sum, equals `k`.\n\n3. **Count Subarrays**: If the difference between the current running sum and `k` exists in the hashmap, it means there is a subarray that sums to `k`. We increment our count by the number of times this difference has occurred.\n\n4. **Update the HashMap**: After checking for subarrays, we update the hashmap with the current running sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a hashmap `prefix_sums` with a default value of 0 for key 0 (to handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning).\n2. Initialize `current_sum` to 0 and `count` to 0.\n3. Iterate over each number in `nums`:\n   - Add the current number to `current_sum`.\n   - Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`.\n   - If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sums`, increment `count` by the value of `prefix_sums[needed_sum]`.\n   - Update `prefix_sums[current_sum]` by incrementing its count.\n4. Return `count`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums\n        prefix_sums = {0: 1}\n        current_sum = 0\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each number in the array\n        for num in nums:\n            # Update the current running sum\n            current_sum += num\n            \n            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k\n            needed_sum = current_sum - k\n            \n            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix sums, it means there is a subarray\n            # that sums to k, so we add the frequency of the needed sum to the count\n            if needed_sum in prefix_sums:\n                count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]\n            \n            # Update the prefix sums with the current sum\n            if current_sum in prefix_sums:\n                prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1\n            else:\n                prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1\n        \n        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum k\n        return count\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We use a hashmap `prefix_sums` to store the frequency of each prefix sum encountered.\n- `current_sum` keeps track of the cumulative sum as we iterate through the array.\n- For each element, we calculate `needed_sum` which is the difference between `current_sum` and `k`. If `needed_sum` is found in `prefix_sums`, it indicates that there is a subarray ending at the current index that sums to `k`.\n- We update the hashmap with the current prefix sum to account for future subarrays.",
