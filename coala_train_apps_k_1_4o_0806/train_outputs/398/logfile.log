INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.

## Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a prefix sum approach with a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of the number of times a particular prefix sum has occurred. The idea is to iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum (prefix sum). For each element, we check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current running sum, equals `k`. If such a prefix sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We count all such subarrays. We also update the hash map with the current prefix sum.

## Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0
   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle cases where subarray starts from index 0
   Initialize `current_sum` to 0
   Initialize `count` to 0

   For each number `num` in `nums`:
       Add `num` to `current_sum`
       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`
       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:
           Add the count of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`
       Increment the count of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`

   Return `count`
   ```

## Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums
        prefix_sum_count = {0: 1}
        current_sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate over each number in the array
        for num in nums:
            # Update the current prefix sum
            current_sum += num
            
            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k
            needed_sum = current_sum - k
            
            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are
            # subarrays ending at the current index which sum to k
            if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:
                count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]
            
            # Update the prefix_sum_count with the current prefix sum
            if current_sum in prefix_sum_count:
                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1
            else:
                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] = 1
        
        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum equal to k
        return count
```

This solution efficiently finds the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a prefix sum approach with a hash map to track the frequency of prefix sums. This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays (subsequences of consecutive elements) in `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. 

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify the positions of odd numbers in the array. This will help us in determining the subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

        2. **Use Two Pointers**: We can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. The idea is to maintain a window that contains exactly `k` odd numbers and count the number of such windows.

        3. **Count Subarrays**: For each valid window (subarray) that contains exactly `k` odd numbers, we can extend the window to the left and right to count all possible subarrays that still contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

        4. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the array, adjusting the window size using the two pointers, and count the number of valid subarrays.

        ## Pseudocode

        1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start of the array.
        2. Initialize a counter `odd_count` to count the number of odd numbers in the current window.
        3. Initialize a variable `result` to store the number of nice subarrays.
        4. Iterate `right` over the array:
           - If `nums[right]` is odd, increment `odd_count`.
           - While `odd_count` is greater than `k`, increment `left` and decrement `odd_count` if `nums[left]` is odd.
           - If `odd_count` equals `k`, count the number of subarrays ending at `right` with exactly `k` odd numbers.
        5. Return `result`.

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
                def count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k):
                    left = 0
                    odd_count = 0
                    result = 0
                    for right in range(len(nums)):
                        if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                            odd_count += 1
                        while odd_count > k:
                            if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                                odd_count -= 1
                            left += 1
                        result += right - left + 1
                    return result
        
                # The number of subarrays with exactly k odd numbers is the difference
                # between the number of subarrays with at most k odd numbers and the
                # number of subarrays with at most k-1 odd numbers.
                return count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k) - count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k - 1)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - The function `count_at_most_k_odd` calculates the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers using a sliding window approach.
        - The main function `numberOfSubarrays` calculates the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by subtracting the number of subarrays with at most `k-1` odd numbers from the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers. This is based on the principle that the difference gives us the exact count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the total number of continuous subarrays within `nums` whose sum equals `k`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Use a HashMap for Prefix Sums**: We can use a hashmap to store the cumulative sum (prefix sum) up to each index. This will help us quickly find the number of subarrays that sum to `k`.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: As we iterate through the array, we maintain a running sum of the elements. For each element, we check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current running sum, equals `k`.

3. **Count Subarrays**: If the difference between the current running sum and `k` exists in the hashmap, it means there is a subarray that sums to `k`. We increment our count by the number of times this difference has occurred.

4. **Update the HashMap**: After checking for subarrays, we update the hashmap with the current running sum.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a hashmap `prefix_sums` with a default value of 0 for key 0 (to handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning).
2. Initialize `current_sum` to 0 and `count` to 0.
3. Iterate over each number in `nums`:
   - Add the current number to `current_sum`.
   - Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`.
   - If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sums`, increment `count` by the value of `prefix_sums[needed_sum]`.
   - Update `prefix_sums[current_sum]` by incrementing its count.
4. Return `count`.

    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a hashmap `prefix_sums` to store the frequency of each prefix sum encountered.
- `current_sum` keeps track of the cumulative sum as we iterate through the array.
- For each element, we calculate `needed_sum` which is the difference between `current_sum` and `k`. If `needed_sum` is found in `prefix_sums`, it indicates that there is a subarray ending at the current index that sums to `k`.
- We update the hashmap with the current prefix sum to account for future subarrays.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the total number of continuous subarrays within `nums` whose sum equals `k`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Use a HashMap for Prefix Sums**: We can use a hashmap to store the cumulative sum (prefix sum) up to each index. This will help us quickly find the number of subarrays that sum to `k`.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: As we iterate through the array, we maintain a running sum of the elements. For each element, we check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current running sum, equals `k`.

3. **Count Subarrays**: If the difference between the current running sum and `k` exists in the hashmap, it means there is a subarray that sums to `k`. We increment our count by the number of times this difference has occurred.

4. **Update the HashMap**: After checking for subarrays, we update the hashmap with the current running sum.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a hashmap `prefix_sums` with a default value of 0 for key 0 (to handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning).
2. Initialize `current_sum` to 0 and `count` to 0.
3. Iterate over each number in `nums`:
   - Add the current number to `current_sum`.
   - Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`.
   - If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sums`, increment `count` by the value of `prefix_sums[needed_sum]`.
   - Update `prefix_sums[current_sum]` by incrementing its count.
4. Return `count`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums
        prefix_sums = {0: 1}
        current_sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate over each number in the array
        for num in nums:
            # Update the current running sum
            current_sum += num
            
            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k
            needed_sum = current_sum - k
            
            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix sums, it means there is a subarray
            # that sums to k, so we add the frequency of the needed sum to the count
            if needed_sum in prefix_sums:
                count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]
            
            # Update the prefix sums with the current sum
            if current_sum in prefix_sums:
                prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
            else:

        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum k
        return count
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a hashmap `prefix_sums` to store the frequency of each prefix sum encountered.
- `current_sum` keeps track of the cumulative sum as we iterate through the array.
- For each element, we calculate `needed_sum` which is the difference between `current_sum` and `k`. If `needed_sum` is found in `prefix_sums`, it indicates that there is a subarray ending at the current index that sums to `k`.
- We update the hashmap with the current prefix sum to account for future subarrays.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.

### Key Concepts:
- **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.
- **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.

### Strategy:
- Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.
- As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.
- Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.

### Code Snippet:
```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        prefix_sums = {0: 1}
        current_sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            current_sum += num
            needed_sum = current_sum - k
            if needed_sum in prefix_sums:
                count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]
            if current_sum in prefix_sums:
                prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
            else:
                prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1
        
        return count
```

This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] The problem of finding the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals a given integer `k` was effectively solved using a prefix sum approach with a hashmap. This approach is both efficient and elegant, leveraging the properties of prefix sums to quickly determine the number of subarrays that meet the criteria.

### Key Insights:

1. **Prefix Sum and Hashmap**: The use of a prefix sum allows us to keep a running total of the sum of elements up to the current index. By storing these sums in a hashmap, we can efficiently check if there exists a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, equals `k`. This indicates the presence of a subarray summing to `k`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The hashmap is initialized with `{0: 1}` to handle cases where a subarray starting from the beginning of the array sums to `k`. This ensures that we correctly count subarrays that start at the first element.

3. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element is processed once, and hashmap operations (insertion and lookup) are average O(1).

4. **Comparison with My Solution**: The official solution is essentially the same as the one I provided, confirming the correctness and efficiency of the approach. Both solutions use a hashmap to track prefix sums and count subarrays efficiently.

This problem reinforces the utility of prefix sums and hashmaps in solving subarray sum problems, providing a robust method for handling such tasks in linear time.
