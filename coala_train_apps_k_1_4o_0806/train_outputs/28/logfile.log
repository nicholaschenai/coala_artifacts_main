## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

We are given a string `s` of length `n` that consists of lowercase English letters and question marks. Our task is to determine if it's possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If it's possible, we should output "Yes" and provide one such resulting string. If not, we should output "No".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s` where "abacaba" could potentially start (i.e., from index 0 to `n-7`), check if it's possible to form "abacaba" by replacing question marks or matching existing characters.

2. **Check for Unique Occurrence**: After forming "abacaba" at a potential position, ensure that this is the only occurrence of "abacaba" in the entire string.

3. **Replace Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all remaining question marks in the string with any arbitrary letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the transformation.

4. **Output the Result**: If a valid transformation is found, output "Yes" and the transformed string. Otherwise, output "No".

### Pseudocode

```
function can_form_abacaba(s, n):
    target = "abacaba"
    target_length = 7

    for start in range(n - target_length + 1):
        # Check if we can form "abacaba" starting at index `start`
        can_form = True
        for i in range(target_length):
            if s[start + i] != '?' and s[start + i] != target[i]:
                can_form = False
                break
        
        if can_form:
            # Create a new string with "abacaba" at the current position
            new_s = list(s)
            for i in range(target_length):
                new_s[start + i] = target[i]
            
            # Check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once
            count = 0
            for i in range(n - target_length + 1):
                if new_s[i:i + target_length] == list(target):
                    count += 1
            
            if count == 1:
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                for i in range(n):

                        new_s[i] = 'z'
                return "Yes", "".join(new_s)
    
    return "No", None

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        result, transformed_string = can_form_abacaba(s, n)
        if result == "Yes":
            print("Yes")
            print(transformed_string)
        else:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We have a string consisting of lowercase English letters. We need to repeatedly remove any occurrence of the substring "abc" from the string until no such substring exists. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through each character of the string and use a stack to build the resulting string. Whenever we encounter the sequence "abc" in the stack, we will remove it. This process will be repeated until we have processed all characters in the string. The stack will help us efficiently manage the removal of "abc" sequences.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           For each test case:
               Initialize an empty stack
               For each character in the string:
                   Push the character onto the stack
                   If the top three characters in the stack form "abc":
                       Pop the top three characters from the stack
               Convert the stack to a string and output it
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for string in test_cases:
                stack = []
                for char in string:
                    stack.append(char)
                    # Check if the last three characters in the stack form "abc"
                    if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:
                        # Remove the "abc" from the stack
                        stack.pop()
                        stack.pop()
                        stack.pop()
                # Convert the stack back to a string
                results.append(''.join(stack))
            return results

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        # First line is the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = data[1:T+1]

        # Get the results
        results = remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases)

        # Print the results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        This solution uses a stack to efficiently manage the removal of "abc" sequences from the string. By checking the top three elements of the stack, we can determine when to remove the sequence and continue processing the rest of the string.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. We need to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If possible, we should output "Yes" and the resulting string; otherwise, output "No".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Possible Positions**: For each position in the string `s`, check if "abacaba" can be placed starting from that position by replacing question marks and matching existing characters.

2. **Check for Unique Occurrence**: After placing "abacaba" at a valid position, ensure that it is the only occurrence in the string.

3. **Replace Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all question marks in the string with 'z' (or any other letter) to complete the string.

4. **Output the Result**: If a valid configuration is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. Otherwise, output "No".

## Pseudocode

```

    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        found = False
        for each position i from 0 to n-7:
            if "abacaba" can be placed at position i:
                create a new string by placing "abacaba" at i
                replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                if "abacaba" occurs exactly once in the new string:
                    print "Yes"
                    print the new string
                    found = True
                    break

                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    if new_s[i + j] == '?':
                        new_s[i + j] = "abacaba"[j]
                
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)
                
                # Check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once
                if count_abacaba(new_s) == 1:
                    results.append("Yes")

            results.append("No")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution iterates over each possible starting position for "abacaba" in the string, checks if it can be placed there, and ensures it is the only occurrence after replacing question marks. If a valid configuration is found, it outputs "Yes" and the resulting string; otherwise, it outputs "No".

 ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. We need to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If possible, we should output "Yes" and the resulting string; otherwise, output "No".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Possible Positions**: For each position in the string `s`, check if "abacaba" can be placed starting from that position by replacing question marks and matching existing characters.

2. **Check for Unique Occurrence**: After placing "abacaba" at a valid position, ensure that it is the only occurrence in the string.

3. **Replace Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all question marks in the string with 'z' (or any other letter) to complete the string.

4. **Output the Result**: If a valid configuration is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. Otherwise, output "No".

## Pseudocode

```
function solve():
    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        found = False
        for each position i from 0 to n-7:
            if "abacaba" can be placed at position i:
                create a new string by placing "abacaba" at i
                replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                if "abacaba" occurs exactly once in the new string:
                    print "Yes"
                    print the new string
                    found = True
                    break
        if not found:
            print "No"

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----

abacaba

abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Reading Input**: The solution uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the code will not execute. This is a common mistake when using functions to encapsulate logic but forgetting to call them.

2. **Output Handling**: The solution appends results to a list and prints them at the end. This is a valid approach, but if the function is not called, no output will be generated.

3. **Function Call**: The main issue seems to be that the `solve()` function is defined but never called. This would result in no output being produced, as the logic inside `solve()` is never executed.

4. **Logic for Replacing '?'**: The logic for replacing '?' with 'z' is correct, but it should be ensured that the replacement happens only after confirming that "abacaba" can be placed at a specific position.

5. **Checking for Unique Occurrence**: The logic to check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once seems correct, but it should be verified that the string is correctly modified before this check.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called, and the input/output handling is correctly set up. Let's update the solution accordingly.

def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"

### Key Fixes:
- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
- **Input/Output Handling**: Ensured that the input is read and output is printed correctly by calling the function.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected and ensure the solution logic is executed correctly.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. We need to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If possible, we should output "Yes" and the resulting string; otherwise, output "No".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Possible Positions**: For each position in the string `s`, check if "abacaba" can be placed starting from that position by replacing question marks and matching existing characters.

2. **Check for Unique Occurrence**: After placing "abacaba" at a valid position, ensure that it is the only occurrence in the string.

3. **Replace Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all question marks in the string with 'z' (or any other letter) to complete the string.

4. **Output the Result**: If a valid configuration is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. Otherwise, output "No".

## Pseudocode

```
function solve():
    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        found = False
        for each position i from 0 to n-7:
            if "abacaba" can be placed at position i:
                create a new string by placing "abacaba" at i
                replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                if "abacaba" occurs exactly once in the new string:
                    print "Yes"
                    print the new string
                    found = True
                    break
        if not found:
            print "No"

function can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    for j from 0 to 6:
        if s[i+j] is not '?' and s[i+j] is not equal to "abacaba"[j]:
            return False
    return True
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
            return False
    return True

def count_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 6):
        if s[i:i+7] == target:
            count += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        found = False
        for i in range(n - 6):
            if can_place_abacaba(s, i):
                # Try to place "abacaba" at position i
                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    if new_s[i + j] == '?':
                        new_s[i + j] = "abacaba"[j]
                
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)
                
                # Check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once
                if count_abacaba(new_s) == 1:
                    results.append("Yes")
                    results.append(new_s)
                    found = True
                    break
        
        if not found:
            results.append("No")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution iterates over each possible starting position for "abacaba" in the string, checks if it can be placed there, and ensures it is the only occurrence after replacing question marks. If a valid configuration is found, it outputs "Yes" and the resulting string; otherwise, it outputs "No".

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Reading Input**: The solution uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the code will not execute. This is a common mistake when using functions to encapsulate logic but forgetting to call them.

2. **Output Handling**: The solution appends results to a list and prints them at the end. This is a valid approach, but if the function is not called, no output will be generated.

3. **Function Call**: The main issue seems to be that the `solve()` function is defined but never called. This would result in no output being produced, as the logic inside `solve()` is never executed.

4. **Logic for Replacing '?'**: The logic for replacing '?' with 'z' is correct, but it should be ensured that the replacement happens only after confirming that "abacaba" can be placed at a specific position.

5. **Checking for Unique Occurrence**: The logic to check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once seems correct, but it should be verified that the string is correctly modified before this check.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called, and the input/output handling is correctly set up. Let's update the solution accordingly.

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:

    return True

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----

7
abacaba

Output

Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No

-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. We need to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If possible, we should output "Yes" and the resulting string; otherwise, output "No".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Possible Positions**: For each position in the string `s`, check if "abacaba" can be placed starting from that position by replacing question marks and matching existing characters.

2. **Check for Unique Occurrence**: After placing "abacaba" at a valid position, ensure that it is the only occurrence in the string.

3. **Replace Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all question marks in the string with 'z' (or any other letter) to complete the string.

4. **Output the Result**: If a valid configuration is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. Otherwise, output "No".

## Pseudocode

```
function solve():
    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        found = False
        for each position i from 0 to n-7:
            if "abacaba" can be placed at position i:
                create a new string by placing "abacaba" at i
                replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                if "abacaba" occurs exactly once in the new string:
                    print "Yes"
                    print the new string
                    found = True
                    break
        if not found:
            print "No"

function can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    for j from 0 to 6:
        if s[i+j] is not '?' and s[i+j] is not equal to "abacaba"[j]:
            return False
    return True
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
            return False
    return True

def count_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 6):
        if s[i:i+7] == target:
            count += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        found = False
        for i in range(n - 6):
            if can_place_abacaba(s, i):
                # Try to place "abacaba" at position i
                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    if new_s[i + j] == '?':
                        new_s[i + j] = "abacaba"[j]
                
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)
                
                # Check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once
                if count_abacaba(new_s) == 1:
                    results.append("Yes")
                    results.append(new_s)
                    found = True
                    break
        
        if not found:
            results.append("No")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution iterates over each possible starting position for "abacaba" in the string, checks if it can be placed there, and ensures it is the only occurrence after replacing question marks. If a valid configuration is found, it outputs "Yes" and the resulting string; otherwise, it outputs "No".

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Reading Input**: The solution uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the code will not execute. This is a common mistake when using functions to encapsulate logic but forgetting to call them.

2. **Output Handling**: The solution appends results to a list and prints them at the end. This is a valid approach, but if the function is not called, no output will be generated.

3. **Function Call**: The main issue seems to be that the `solve()` function is defined but never called. This would result in no output being produced, as the logic inside `solve()` is never executed.

4. **Logic for Replacing '?'**: The logic for replacing '?' with 'z' is correct, but it should be ensured that the replacement happens only after confirming that "abacaba" can be placed at a specific position.

5. **Checking for Unique Occurrence**: The logic to check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once seems correct, but it should be verified that the string is correctly modified before this check.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called, and the input/output handling is correctly set up. Let's update the solution accordingly.

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] In tackling the problem of determining if the string "abacaba" can be placed exactly once in a given string with question marks, the core concept was to identify potential positions for "abacaba" and ensure it appears exactly once after replacing question marks. The problem tested the ability to manipulate strings and handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Initially, the solution logic was encapsulated in a function, but it wasn't called, leading to no output. This highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed, especially in competitive programming settings where input/output is handled through standard IO.

The strategy that worked involved:
1. Iterating over each possible starting position in the string to check if "abacaba" could be placed by replacing question marks.
2. Replacing remaining question marks with a filler character ('z') to complete the string.
3. Verifying that "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string.

The unexpected error of no output was fixed by explicitly calling the `solve()` function, ensuring the logic was executed. This experience reinforced the importance of verifying function calls and understanding input/output handling in script-based environments. The final solution efficiently handled multiple test cases and correctly determined the possibility of placing "abacaba" exactly once.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. We need to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If possible, we should output "Yes" and the resulting string; otherwise, output "No".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Possible Positions**: For each position in the string `s`, check if "abacaba" can be placed starting from that position by replacing question marks and matching existing characters.

2. **Check for Unique Occurrence**: After placing "abacaba" at a valid position, ensure that it is the only occurrence in the string.

3. **Replace Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all question marks in the string with 'z' (or any other letter) to complete the string.

4. **Output the Result**: If a valid configuration is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. Otherwise, output "No".

## Pseudocode

```
function solve():
    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        found = False
        for each position i from 0 to n-7:
            if "abacaba" can be placed at position i:
                create a new string by placing "abacaba" at i
                replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                if "abacaba" occurs exactly once in the new string:
                    print "Yes"
                    print the new string
                    found = True
                    break
        if not found:
            print "No"

function can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    for j from 0 to 6:
        if s[i+j] is not '?' and s[i+j] is not equal to "abacaba"[j]:
            return False
    return True
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
            return False
    return True

def count_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 6):
        if s[i:i+7] == target:
            count += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        found = False
        for i in range(n - 6):
            if can_place_abacaba(s, i):
                # Try to place "abacaba" at position i
                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    if new_s[i + j] == '?':
                        new_s[i + j] = "abacaba"[j]
                
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)
                
                # Check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once
                if count_abacaba(new_s) == 1:
                    results.append("Yes")
                    results.append(new_s)
                    found = True
                    break
        
        if not found:
            results.append("No")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution iterates over each possible starting position for "abacaba" in the string, checks if it can be placed there, and ensures it is the only occurrence after replacing question marks. If a valid configuration is found, it outputs "Yes" and the resulting string; otherwise, it outputs "No".

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Reading Input**: The solution uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the code will not execute. This is a common mistake when using functions to encapsulate logic but forgetting to call them.

2. **Output Handling**: The solution appends results to a list and prints them at the end. This is a valid approach, but if the function is not called, no output will be generated.

3. **Function Call**: The main issue seems to be that the `solve()` function is defined but never called. This would result in no output being produced, as the logic inside `solve()` is never executed.

4. **Logic for Replacing '?'**: The logic for replacing '?' with 'z' is correct, but it should be ensured that the replacement happens only after confirming that "abacaba" can be placed at a specific position.

5. **Checking for Unique Occurrence**: The logic to check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once seems correct, but it should be verified that the string is correctly modified before this check.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called, and the input/output handling is correctly set up. Let's update the solution accordingly.

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task was to determine if the string "abacaba" can be placed exactly once in a given string by replacing question marks. This required checking possible placements and ensuring uniqueness.

2. **Initial Approach**: My approach involved iterating over possible starting positions for "abacaba", checking if it could be placed, and then verifying if it was the only occurrence. This was done by replacing '?' with 'z' after placing "abacaba".

3. **Official Solution Insights**:
   - **Check Function**: The official solution uses a `check` function to count occurrences of "abacaba" in the string, which is a clean and reusable way to handle this check.
   - **Early Exit**: The solution immediately exits if more than one occurrence is found initially, which is efficient.
   - **Iterative Replacement**: The official solution iteratively tries to place "abacaba" and checks if the resulting string has exactly one occurrence, similar to my approach but with a more structured flow.
   - **Use of Copy**: The official solution uses a copy of the string (`ok = s[::]`) to test modifications, ensuring the original string remains unchanged for further attempts.

4. **Efficiency and Clarity**: The official solution is efficient in handling edge cases and uses clear logic to ensure the string is modified correctly. It also uses Python's list slicing and copying effectively to manage string modifications.

5. **Learning Points**:
   - **Function Reusability**: The use of a separate function to count occurrences is a good practice for clarity and reusability.
   - **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution efficiently handles cases where "abacaba" is already present or cannot be placed uniquely.
   - **Code Structure**: The structured approach of checking, modifying, and verifying in a loop is a robust way to handle such problems.

Overall, the official solution provided a structured and efficient way to solve the problem, reinforcing the importance of clear logic and efficient handling of string operations in competitive programming.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a string length and a string possibly containing '?' characters. For each test case, it attempts to replace '?' characters in the string to form exactly one occurrence of the substring "abacaba". It iterates over possible starting positions in the string, checking if "abacaba" can be placed there by replacing '?' with the appropriate characters. If successful, it replaces all remaining '?' with 'z' and verifies that "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string. The function outputs "Yes" and the modified string if successful, or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

[Problem]
    Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

    You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

    Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

    Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

    Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


    -----Input-----

    First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

    The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

    The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case output an answer for it.

    In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

    Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

    You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


    -----Example-----
    Input
    6
    7
    abacaba
    7
    ???????
    11
    aba?abacaba
    11
    abacaba?aba
    15
    asdf???f???qwer
    11
    abacabacaba

    Output
    Yes
    abacaba
    Yes
    abacaba
    Yes
    abadabacaba
    Yes
    abacabadaba
    No
    No



    -----Note-----

    In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

    In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

    In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.
