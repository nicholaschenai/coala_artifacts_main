Today he came with the following problem.\n\nYou are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string \"abacaba\" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?\n\nEach question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string \"a?b?c\" can be transformed into strings \"aabbc\" and \"azbzc\", but can't be transformed into strings \"aabc\", \"a?bbc\" and \"babbc\".\n\nOccurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string \"ababa\" has two occurrences of a string \"aba\" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string \"aba\" in the string \"acba\" as a substring.\n\nPlease help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string \"abacaba\" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \\leq n \\leq 50$), length of a string $s$.\n\nThe second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case output an answer for it.\n\nIn case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string \"abacaba\" in the resulting string as a substring output \"No\".\n\nOtherwise output \"Yes\" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.\n\nYou may print every letter in \"Yes\" and \"No\" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n7\nabacaba\n7\n???????\n11\naba?abacaba\n11\nabacaba?aba\n15\nasdf???f???qwer\n11\nabacabacaba\n\nOutput\nYes\nabacaba\nYes\nabacaba\nYes\nabadabacaba\nYes\nabacabadaba\nNo\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string \"abacaba\" in the string \"abacaba\" as a substring.\n\nIn second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with \"abacaba\" in particular.\n\nIn sixth example there are two occurrences of a string \"abacaba\" as a substring.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Our task is to determine if it's possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string \"abacaba\" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If it's possible, we should output \"Yes\" and provide one such resulting string. If not, we should output \"No\".\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s` where \"abacaba\" could potentially start (i.e., from index 0 to `n-7`), check if it's possible to form \"abacaba\" by replacing question marks or matching existing characters.\n\n2. **Check for Unique Occurrence**: After forming \"abacaba\" at a potential position, ensure that this is the only occurrence of \"abacaba\" in the entire string.\n\n3. **Replace Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all remaining question marks in the string with any arbitrary letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the transformation.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: If a valid transformation is found, output \"Yes\" and the transformed string. Otherwise, output \"No\".\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction can_form_abacaba(s, n):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    target_length = 7\n\n    for start in range(n - target_length + 1):\n        # Check if we can form \"abacaba\" starting at index `start`\n        can_form = True\n        for i in range(target_length):\n            if s[start + i] != '?' and s[start + i] != target[i]:\n                can_form = False\n                break\n        \n        if can_form:\n            # Create a new string with \"abacaba\" at the current position\n            new_s = list(s)\n            for i in range(target_length):\n                new_s[start + i] = target[i]\n            \n            # Check if \"abacaba\" occurs exactly once\n            count = 0\n            for i in range(n - target_length + 1):\n                if new_s[i:i + target_length] == list(target):\n                    count += 1\n            \n            if count == 1:\n                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if new_s[i] == '?':\n                        new_s[i] = 'z'\n                return \"Yes\", \"\".join(new_s)\n    \n    return \"No\", None\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read n\n        read s\n        result, transformed_string = can_form_abacaba(s, n)\n        if result == \"Yes\":\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            print(transformed_string)\n        else:\n            print(\"No\")\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef can_form_abacaba(s, n):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    target_length = 7\n\n    for start in range(n - target_length + 1):\n        # Check if we can form \"abacaba\" starting at index `start`\n        can_form = True\n        for i in range(target_length):\n            if s[start + i] != '?' and s[start + i] != target[i]:\n                can_form = False\n                break\n        \n        if can_form:\n            # Create a new string with \"abacaba\" at the current position\n            new_s = list(s)\n            for i in range(target_length):\n                new_s[start + i] = target[i]\n            \n            # Check if \"abacaba\" occurs exactly once\n            count = 0\n            for i in range(n - target_length + 1):\n                if new_s[i:i + target_length] == list(target):\n                    count += 1\n            \n            if count == 1:\n                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if new_s[i] == '?':\n                        new_s[i] = 'z'\n                return \"Yes\", \"\".join(new_s)\n    \n    return \"No\", None\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        s = data[index + 1]\n        index += 2\n        \n        result, transformed_string = can_form_abacaba(s, n)\n        if result == \"Yes\":\n            results.append(\"Yes\")\n            results.append(transformed_string)\n        else:\n            results.append(\"No\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```"

We need to repeatedly remove any occurrence of the substring \"abc\" from the string until no such substring exists. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through each character of the string and use a stack to build the resulting string. Whenever we encounter the sequence \"abc\" in the stack, we will remove it. This process will be repeated until we have processed all characters in the string. The stack will help us efficiently manage the removal of \"abc\" sequences.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           For each test case:\n               Initialize an empty stack\n               For each character in the string:\n                   Push the character onto the stack\n                   If the top three characters in the stack form \"abc\":\n                       Pop the top three characters from the stack\n               Convert the stack to a string and output it\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        def remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for string in test_cases:\n                stack = []\n                for char in string:\n                    stack.append(char)\n                    # Check if the last three characters in the stack form \"abc\"\n                    if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n                        # Remove the \"abc\" from the stack\n                        stack.pop()\n                        stack.pop()\n                        stack.pop()\n                # Convert the stack back to a string\n                results.append(''.join(stack))\n            return results\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        # First line is the number of test cases\n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = data[1:T+1]\n\n        # Get the results\n        results = remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases)\n\n        # Print the results\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses a stack to efficiently manage the removal of \"abc\" sequences from the string.

However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the code will not execute. This is a common mistake when using functions to encapsulate logic but forgetting to call them.\n\n2. **Output Handling**: The solution appends results to a list and prints them at the end. This is a valid approach, but if the function is not called, no output will be generated.\n\n3. **Function Call**: The main issue seems to be that the `solve()` function is defined but never called. This would result in no output being produced, as the logic inside `solve()` is never executed.\n\n4. **Logic for Replacing '?'**: The logic for replacing '?' with 'z' is correct, but it should be ensured that the replacement happens only after confirming that \"abacaba\" can be placed at a specific position.\n\n5. **Checking for Unique Occurrence**: The logic to check if \"abacaba\" occurs exactly once seems correct, but it should be verified that the string is correctly modified before this check.\n\nTo fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called, and the input/output handling is correctly set up. Let's update the solution accordingly.\n\n```python\ndef can_place_abacaba(s, i):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    for j in range(7):\n        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef count_abacaba(s):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n        if s[i:i+7] == target:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        s = data[index + 1]\n        index += 2\n        \n        found = False\n        for i in range(n - 6):\n            if can_place_abacaba(s, i):\n                # Try to place \"abacaba\" at position i\n                new_s = list(s)\n                for j in range(7):\n                    if new_s[i + j] == '?':\n                        new_s[i + j] = \"abacaba\"[j]\n                \n                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'\n                new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)\n                \n                # Check if \"abacaba\" occurs exactly once\n                if count_abacaba(new_s) == 1:\n                    results.append(\"Yes\")\n                    results.append(new_s)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n        \n        if not found:\n            results.append(\"No\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the solution\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Key Fixes:\n- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.\n- **Input/Output Handling**: Ensured that the input is read and output is printed correctly by calling the function.\n\nThis should resolve the issue of no output being detected and ensure the solution logic is executed correctly."

The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.\n\n    #### Key Insights and Strategies\n\n    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.\n\n    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N = test_case[0]\n            A = test_case[1]\n        \n            current_sum = 0\n            possible = True\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                current_sum += A[i]\n                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n        \n            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This required checking possible placements and ensuring uniqueness.\n\n2. **Initial Approach**: My approach involved iterating over possible starting positions for \"abacaba\", checking if it could be placed, and then verifying if it was the only occurrence. This was done by replacing '?' with 'z' after placing \"abacaba\".\n\n3. **Official Solution Insights**:\n   - **Check Function**: The official solution uses a `check` function to count occurrences of \"abacaba\" in the string, which is a clean and reusable way to handle this check.\n   - **Early Exit**: The solution immediately exits if more than one occurrence is found initially, which is efficient.\n   - **Iterative Replacement**: The official solution iteratively tries to place \"abacaba\" and checks if the resulting string has exactly one occurrence, similar to my approach but with a more structured flow.\n   - **Use of Copy**: The official solution uses a copy of the string (`ok = s[::]`) to test modifications, ensuring the original string remains unchanged for further attempts.\n\n4. **Efficiency and Clarity**: The official solution is efficient in handling edge cases and uses clear logic to ensure the string is modified correctly. It also uses Python's list slicing and copying effectively to manage string modifications.\n\n5. **Learning Points**:\n   - **Function Reusability**: The use of a separate function to count occurrences is a good practice for clarity and reusability.\n   - **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution efficiently handles cases where \"abacaba\" is already present or cannot be placed uniquely.\n   - **Code Structure**: The structured approach of checking, modifying, and verifying in a loop is a robust way to handle such problems.\n\nOverall, the official solution provided a structured and efficient way to solve the problem, reinforcing the importance of clear logic and efficient handling of string operations in competitive programming."

For each test case, it attempts to replace '?' characters in the string to form exactly one occurrence of the substring \"abacaba\". It iterates over possible starting positions in the string, checking if \"abacaba\" can be placed there by replacing '?' with the appropriate characters. If successful, it replaces all remaining '?' with 'z' and verifies that \"abacaba\" appears exactly once in the modified string.
