    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given multiple test cases, each with a sequence of integers. For each sequence, we need to determine how many ways we can remove a non-empty contiguous subsequence such that the remaining sequence is non-empty and strictly increasing.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to identify all strictly increasing subsequences in the given sequence. For each strictly increasing subsequence, we can remove it and check if the remaining sequence is non-empty. The number of such valid removals is the answer for each test case.\n\n   The key observation is that for any strictly increasing subsequence, the elements before and after it can form a valid sequence if they are non-empty. We can iterate through the sequence and keep track of the length of the current strictly increasing subsequence. For each element, if it breaks the increasing order, we calculate the number of ways to remove the subsequence formed so far.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function countWays(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           N = length of the sequence\n           A = the sequence\n           count = 0\n           start = 0\n           \n           for i from 1 to N:\n               if i == N or A[i] <= A[i-1]:\n                   length = i - start\n                   if length > 1:\n                       count += (length * (length - 1)) // 2\n                   start = i\n           \n           print count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef countWays(T, test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N = test_case[0]\n        A = test_case[1]\n        count = 0\n        start = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through the sequence to find strictly increasing subsequences\n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            # If we reach the end or the sequence is not increasing\n            if i == N or A[i] <= A[i - 1]:\n                # Calculate the length of the current increasing subsequence\n                length = i - start\n                # If the length is greater than 1, calculate the number of ways\n                if length > 1:\n                    # Number of ways to choose two different elements in the subsequence\n                    count += (length * (length - 1)) // 2\n                # Update the start to the current position\n                start = i\n        \n        # Output the count of ways for the current test case\n        print(count)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n    test_cases.append((N, A))\n    index += N + 1\n\ncountWays(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through each sequence, identifies strictly increasing subsequences, and calculates the number of ways to remove them while ensuring the remaining sequence is non-empty.",
