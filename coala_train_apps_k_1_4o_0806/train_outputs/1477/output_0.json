    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a string of uppercase English letters, and we are allowed to move one character to any other position in the string. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation. We need to do this for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible. We can iterate through the string to find the smallest character and its position. If this character is not already at the beginning, we can remove it and insert it at the start of the string. This will give us the smallest possible string for that test case.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   For each test case:\n       Read the string S\n       Initialize min_char to the first character of S\n       Initialize min_index to 0\n       For each character in S starting from the second character:\n           If the character is smaller than min_char:\n               Update min_char and min_index\n       If min_index is not 0:\n           Remove the character at min_index and insert it at the start of the string\n       Output the modified string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for i in range(T):\n        N, S = test_cases[i]\n        \n        # Initialize the minimum character and its index\n        min_char = S[0]\n        min_index = 0\n        \n        # Find the smallest character and its index\n        for j in range(1, N):\n            if S[j] < min_char:\n                min_char = S[j]\n                min_index = j\n        \n        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start\n        if min_index != 0:\n            S = S[:min_index] + S[min_index+1:]  # Remove the character at min_index\n            S = min_char + S  # Insert it at the start\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(S)\n    \n    # Output all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# First line is the number of test cases\nT = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = []\n\n# Read each test case\nindex = 1\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    S = data[index + 1]\n    test_cases.append((N, S))\n    index += 2\n\n# Find and print the lexicographically smallest strings\nfind_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through each test case, finds the smallest character in the string, and moves it to the start if it's not already there. This ensures that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest possible.",
