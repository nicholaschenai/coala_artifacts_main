    "summary": "In tackling the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character, I initially made the mistake of assuming that moving the smallest character to the start would always yield the smallest string. This approach failed because it didn't consider the impact of moving other characters, which might result in a smaller string.\n\nThe core concept here is to evaluate all possible single-character moves to determine the smallest possible string. The correct strategy involves iterating over each character in the string, removing it, and inserting it at every other position to generate all possible strings. By comparing these strings, we can identify the lexicographically smallest one.\n\nThe key takeaway is the importance of considering all permutations of a single operation when trying to optimize a string lexicographically. This problem reinforced the need to thoroughly explore all potential transformations rather than relying on a single heuristic. The final solution involved a nested loop to generate and compare all possible strings, ensuring the smallest result was found. This approach is useful for similar problems where a single operation can be applied in multiple ways to achieve an optimal result.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, the task was to find the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character to any other position in the string. The official solution and my final approach both involve iterating over each character in the string, removing it, and then trying to insert it at every possible position to find the smallest possible string.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Iterative Character Movement:**\n   - Both solutions iterate over each character in the string, remove it, and attempt to insert it at every possible position. This ensures that all potential single-character moves are considered.\n\n2. **Lexicographical Comparison:**\n   - The solutions maintain a variable to track the smallest string encountered during these operations. By comparing each newly formed string with the current smallest, we ensure that the final result is the lexicographically smallest string possible.\n\n3. **Efficiency:**\n   - Given the constraints (maximum string length of 50 and up to 50 test cases), this approach is efficient enough. The complexity is manageable due to the limited size of the input.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe problem reinforced the importance of considering all possible operations when trying to optimize a string lexicographically. The official solution was straightforward and aligned well with the final approach I implemented. It was a good exercise in ensuring that all permutations of a single operation are considered to achieve the optimal result. This problem also highlighted the utility of simple iterative and comparison techniques in solving string manipulation problems effectively.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_lexicographically_smallest_string]\nThe function processes multiple test cases to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by moving each character of the given string to every other position. For each test case, it initializes the smallest string as the original string and iterates over each character, removing it and attempting to insert it at every possible position in the remaining string. It updates the smallest string whenever a new permutation is found to be smaller. After processing all characters for a test case, it stores the smallest string found. Finally, it prints the smallest string for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to rearrange characters in a string to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order with minimal operations. This can be applied in text processing, data sorting, and optimization problems where constraints limit the number of operations. Understanding how to manipulate strings efficiently is crucial in competitive programming and algorithm design, especially when dealing with constraints on operations. The solution demonstrates a brute-force approach to test all possible single-character moves, which is feasible given the problem's constraints, and can be adapted to similar problems with small input sizes."
