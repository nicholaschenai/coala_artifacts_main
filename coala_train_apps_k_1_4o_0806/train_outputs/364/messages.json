You can fill a jug, empty a jug, or pour water from one jug to another until one is full or the other is empty. The goal is to see if you can end up with exactly `z` liters in one or both jugs.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nThe problem is a classic example of the \"water jug problem,\" which can be solved using the mathematical concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The key insight is that you can measure exactly `z` liters if and only if `z` is a multiple of the GCD of `x` and `y`, and `z` is less than or equal to the sum of `x` and `y`.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Check if `z` is greater than the sum of `x` and `y`:** If `z` is greater than `x + y`, it's impossible to measure `z` liters because the total capacity of both jugs is insufficient.\n\n2. **Calculate the GCD of `x` and `y`:** Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of `x` and `y`.\n\n3. **Check if `z` is a multiple of the GCD:** If `z` is a multiple of the GCD, then it is possible to measure `z` liters using the jugs.\n\n4. **Return the result:** If both conditions are satisfied, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction canMeasureWater(x, y, z):\n    if z > x + y:\n        return False\n    \n    gcd = calculateGCD(x, y)\n    \n    if z % gcd == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nfunction calculateGCD(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        temp = b\n        b = a % b\n        a = temp\n    return a\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def canMeasureWater(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> bool:\n        # Helper function to calculate the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm\n        def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n            while b != 0:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n        \n        # If z is greater than the total capacity of both jugs, it's impossible\n        if z > x + y:\n            return False\n        \n        # Calculate the GCD of x and y\n        gcd_value = gcd(x, y)\n        \n        # Check if z is a multiple of the GCD\n        return z % gcd_value == 0\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently determines if it's possible to measure exactly `z` liters using the two jugs by leveraging the properties of the GCD."

The key insight was recognizing that this simultaneous presence occurs at intervals that are multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of their respective visit intervals (x, y, z).\n\n    The solution involved calculating the LCM of three numbers, which required understanding and implementing the greatest common divisor (GCD) function. The LCM of two numbers can be calculated using the formula: `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`. For three numbers, the LCM can be found by chaining this operation: `lcm(lcm(x, y), z)`.\n\n    The strategy was straightforward: compute the total number of hours over the given days, calculate the LCM of the visit intervals, and then determine how many times this LCM fits into the total hours. This approach efficiently solved the problem within the constraints.\n\n    The implementation was successful on the first attempt, with no unexpected errors. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding LCM and GCD calculations, which are common in problems involving periodic events or schedules.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
