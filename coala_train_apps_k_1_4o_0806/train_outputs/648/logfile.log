## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills, each with a specific height. We need to handle two types of operations on these hills:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start at the given hill index `i`.
   - For each jump, look for the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.
   - If such a hill is found within 100 hills, move to that hill and continue jumping.
   - If no such hill is found, or if the maximum number of jumps `k` is reached, stop and return the current hill index.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of Type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i - 1
            for jump in range(k):
                found_higher_hill = False
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        current_index = j
                        found_higher_hill = True
                        break
                if not found_higher_hill:
                    break
            output current_index + 1
        else if operation is of Type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    results = []
    for operation in operations:
        if operation[0] == 1:
            # Type 1 operation
            i, k = operation[1], operation[2]
            current_index = i - 1
            for _ in range(k):
                found_higher_hill = False
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        current_index = j
                        found_higher_hill = True
                        break
                if not found_higher_hill:
                    break
            results.append(current_index + 1)
        elif operation[0] == 2:
            # Type 2 operation
            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
N = int(data[0])
Q = int(data[1])
heights = list(map(int, data[2:N+2]))
operations = []
index = N + 2
for _ in range(Q):
    op_type = int(data[index])
    if op_type == 1:
        i = int(data[index + 1])
        k = int(data[index + 2])
        operations.append((1, i, k))
        index += 3
    elif op_type == 2:
        L = int(data[index + 1])
        R = int(data[index + 2])
        X = int(data[index + 3])
        operations.append((2, L, R, X))
        index += 4

# Process operations and print results
results = process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the results for Type 1 operations. The logic ensures that the constraints and requirements of the problem are met efficiently.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.

Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        In ChefLand, there is a mountain range consisting of $N$ hills (numbered $1$ through $N$) in a straight line. Let's denote the height of the $i$-th hill from the left by $h_i$.
        Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it â€” either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height $h$, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than $h$; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.
        For example, suppose we have hills with heights $[7, 2, 3, 5, 8]$. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height $5$, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights $2$, $3$ and $5$ are supplied with water.
        Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of reservoirs.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $2 \le N \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
        - $h_i \neq h_j $ for any valid $i \neq j$
        - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

        1
        6
        4 16 32 6 8 2

        -----Example Output-----

    [Previous Critique]:
        ## Analysis of the Problem

        The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to supply water to all hills. The water can flow from a reservoir in one direction until it encounters a hill that is taller than the hill with the reservoir. The goal is to cover all hills with the fewest reservoirs.

        ## Where the Code Went Wrong

        1. **Understanding the Problem**: The code attempts to calculate the farthest reach to the left and right for each hill, but it doesn't correctly use this information to minimize the number of reservoirs.

        2. **Greedy Strategy Misapplication**: The code uses a greedy approach to place reservoirs, but it doesn't correctly account for overlapping coverage from different reservoirs. This leads to placing more reservoirs than necessary.

        3. **Incorrect Logic in Traversal**: The logic for determining the farthest reach in the `right` and `left` arrays is correct, but the final step of determining the minimum number of reservoirs is flawed. The code doesn't correctly handle the overlap between the coverage of different reservoirs.

        ## Correct Approach

        1. **Calculate Right and Left Reach**: For each hill, determine how far water can flow to the right and left.

        2. **Use Overlapping Coverage**: Use the calculated reach to determine the minimum number of reservoirs by considering overlapping coverage. This involves checking the maximum reach of the current reservoir and ensuring that all hills are covered.

        3. **Iterate with Overlap Consideration**: Start from the first hill and place a reservoir. Move to the next hill that is not covered by the current reservoir's reach, and repeat until all hills are covered.

        ## Revised Pseudocode

        1. For each test case:
           - Read the number of hills `N` and their heights.
           - Initialize two arrays `left` and `right` to store the farthest hill that can be supplied to the left and right, respectively.
           - Traverse from left to right to fill the `right` array.
           - Traverse from right to left to fill the `left` array.
           - Use a greedy approach to place reservoirs by considering the maximum reach of each reservoir and ensuring all hills are covered.

        ## Revised Python Solution

        ```python
        def minimum_reservoirs(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for case in test_cases:
                N, heights = case
                right = [0] * N
                left = [0] * N
        
                # Calculate right reach for each hill
                for i in range(N):
                    right[i] = i
                    while right[i] + 1 < N and heights[right[i] + 1] < heights[i]:
                        right[i] += 1
        
                # Calculate left reach for each hill
                for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
                    left[i] = i
                    while left[i] - 1 >= 0 and heights[left[i] - 1] < heights[i]:
                        left[i] -= 1
        
                # Determine the minimum number of reservoirs
                reservoirs = 0
                i = 0
                while i < N:
                    reservoirs += 1
                    # Find the farthest hill we can cover with a reservoir
                    farthest = right[i]
                    while i <= farthest:
                        farthest = max(farthest, right[i])
                        i += 1
        
                results.append(reservoirs)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            heights = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
            test_cases.append((N, heights))
            index += N + 1

        minimum_reservoirs(T, test_cases)
        ```

        This revised solution correctly calculates the minimum number of reservoirs by considering the overlapping coverage of each reservoir and ensuring all hills are covered efficiently.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's address the problem by correctly implementing the logic to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed. The key is to ensure that we are correctly using the reach of each reservoir to cover all hills optimally.

        The previous solution was incorrect because it didn't properly account for the optimal placement of reservoirs considering both left and right reaches. Let's fix this by using a more strategic approach.

        ```python
        def minimum_reservoirs(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for case in test_cases:
                N, heights = case
        
                # We need to find the minimum number of reservoirs
                # We will use a greedy approach to cover the hills
        
                # Initialize the number of reservoirs
                reservoirs = 0
        
                # Start from the first hill
                i = 0
        
                while i < N:
                    # Place a reservoir at the current hill
                    reservoirs += 1
            
                    # Find the farthest hill we can cover to the right
                    j = i

        ### Explanation

        1. **Greedy Approach**: We iterate through the hills and place a reservoir at the current hill. We then find the farthest hill to the right that can be covered by this reservoir.

        2. **Move to Next Uncovered Hill**: After placing a reservoir, we move to the next hill that is not covered by the current reservoir's reach.

        3. **Repeat Until All Hills Are Covered**: We repeat this process until all hills are covered, counting the number of reservoirs placed.

        This approach ensures that we are using the minimum number of reservoirs by maximizing the reach of each reservoir placed.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills with given heights. We need to perform two types of operations:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start at the given hill index `i`.
   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.
   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.
   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i - 1
            for jump in range(k):
                next_index = -1
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        next_index = j
                        break
                if next_index == -1:
                    break
                current_index = next_index
            print(current_index + 1)
        
        else if operation is of type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X
```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] In this problem, I dealt with a sequence of hills and two types of operations: jumping between hills and adjusting hill heights. The core concept was efficiently managing these operations given constraints on the number of hills and operations.

For the Type 1 operation, the challenge was to simulate jumps between hills based on height conditions. The key was to iterate over the hills to the right of the current position and find the nearest hill that is strictly higher, ensuring the search is limited to a maximum of 100 hills to the right. This required careful index management to avoid out-of-bounds errors.

For the Type 2 operation, the task was straightforward: adjust the heights of hills within a specified range. This involved iterating over the specified range and updating the heights directly.

The solution involved reading input data efficiently, processing each operation, and outputting results for Type 1 operations. The use of Python's list and range functionalities was crucial for handling the operations within the constraints. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding index-based operations and efficient iteration in large datasets.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills with given heights. We need to perform two types of operations:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start at the given hill index `i`.
   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.
   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.
   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i - 1
            for jump in range(k):
                next_index = -1
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        next_index = j
                        break
                if next_index == -1:
                    break
                current_index = next_index
            print(current_index + 1)
        
        else if operation is of type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X
```

## Final Python Solution

def process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for operation in operations:
        if operation[0] == 1:
            # Type 1 operation

                next_index = -1
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        next_index = j
                        break
                if next_index == -1:
                    break
                current_index = next_index
            print(current_index + 1)
        
        elif operation[0] == 2:
            # Type 2 operation
            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X

# Read input

index = N + 2
for _ in range(Q):
    op_type = int(data[index])
    if op_type == 1:
        i = int(data[index + 1])
        k = int(data[index + 2])
        operations.append((1, i, k))
        index += 3

This solution reads the input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the result for each Type 1 operation. The heights are updated in-place for Type 2 operations.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the hill jumping competition, the approach I took was quite similar to the official solution, but there are a few insights worth noting:

1. **Handling Type 1 Operations**: Both my solution and the official solution correctly iterate over the hills to find the next higher hill within a range of 100 hills. The official solution uses a `while` loop with a `temp` flag to break out of the loop once a valid jump is found, which is a slightly different approach than my nested `for` loop. This use of a flag can be a useful pattern to remember for early exits in loops.

2. **Handling Type 2 Operations**: Both solutions update the heights in a straightforward manner by iterating over the specified range and adjusting the heights. This part of the problem is relatively simple and both solutions handle it efficiently.

3. **Output Collection**: The official solution collects all results for Type 1 operations in a list and prints them at the end. This is a good practice for problems where output needs to be collected and printed in bulk, as it can sometimes be more efficient than printing immediately, especially in competitive programming environments.

Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively address the requirements. The key takeaway is the use of control structures like flags for early exits in loops, which can simplify logic and improve readability.

This is a common pattern in competitive programming and can be applied to problems involving range queries and updates, such as those that can be solved using segment trees or binary indexed trees.
