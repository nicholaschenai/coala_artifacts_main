In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.\nJudges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.\nPlease help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:\nType 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).\nType 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).\n\n-----Input-----\n- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.\n- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.\n- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 100,000\n- 1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 1,000,000\n- 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N\n- -1,000,000 \u2264 X \u2264 1,000,000\n- 1 \u2264 i, k \u2264 N\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 1,000 \n- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n5 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 1 2\n2 3 4 -1\n1 1 2\n\nOutput:\n3\n4\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.\nThe second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).\nThe last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Let's denote the height of the $i$-th hill from the left by $h_i$.\n        Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it \u2014 either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height $h$, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than $h$; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.\n        For example, suppose we have hills with heights $[7, 2, 3, 5, 8]$. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height $5$, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights $2$, $3$ and $5$ are supplied with water.\n        Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\n        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_N$.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the minimum required number of reservoirs.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $2 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n        - $1 \\le h_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\n        - $h_i \\neq h_j $ for any valid $i \\neq j$\n        - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^5$\n\n        -----Example Input-----\n        1\n        6\n        4 16 32 6 8 2\n\n        -----Example Output-----\n        2    \n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        Example case 1: We can place reservoirs on the second and third hill, pumping water to the left and right respectively.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        ## Analysis of the Problem\n\n        The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to supply water to all hills. The water can flow from a reservoir in one direction until it encounters a hill that is taller than the hill with the reservoir. The goal is to cover all hills with the fewest reservoirs.\n\n        ## Where the Code Went Wrong\n\n        1. **Understanding the Problem**: The code attempts to calculate the farthest reach to the left and right for each hill, but it doesn't correctly use this information to minimize the number of reservoirs.\n\n        2. **Greedy Strategy Misapplication**: The code uses a greedy approach to place reservoirs, but it doesn't correctly account for overlapping coverage from different reservoirs. This leads to placing more reservoirs than necessary.\n\n        3. **Incorrect Logic in Traversal**: The logic for determining the farthest reach in the `right` and `left` arrays is correct, but the final step of determining the minimum number of reservoirs is flawed. The code doesn't correctly handle the overlap between the coverage of different reservoirs.\n\n        ## Correct Approach\n\n        1. **Calculate Right and Left Reach**: For each hill, determine how far water can flow to the right and left.\n\n        2. **Use Overlapping Coverage**: Use the calculated reach to determine the minimum number of reservoirs by considering overlapping coverage. This involves checking the maximum reach of the current reservoir and ensuring that all hills are covered.\n\n        3. **Iterate with Overlap Consideration**: Start from the first hill and place a reservoir. Move to the next hill that is not covered by the current reservoir's reach, and repeat until all hills are covered.\n\n        ## Revised Pseudocode\n\n        1. For each test case:\n           - Read the number of hills `N` and their heights.\n           - Initialize two arrays `left` and `right` to store the farthest hill that can be supplied to the left and right, respectively.\n           - Traverse from left to right to fill the `right` array.\n           - Traverse from right to left to fill the `left` array.\n           - Use a greedy approach to place reservoirs by considering the maximum reach of each reservoir and ensuring all hills are covered.\n\n        ## Revised Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def minimum_reservoirs(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for case in test_cases:\n                N, heights = case\n                right = [0] * N\n                left = [0] * N\n        \n                # Calculate right reach for each hill\n                for i in range(N):\n                    right[i] = i\n                    while right[i] + 1 < N and heights[right[i] + 1] < heights[i]:\n                        right[i] += 1\n        \n                # Calculate left reach for each hill\n                for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):\n                    left[i] = i\n                    while left[i] - 1 >= 0 and heights[left[i] - 1] < heights[i]:\n                        left[i] -= 1\n        \n                # Determine the minimum number of reservoirs\n                reservoirs = 0\n                i = 0\n                while i < N:\n                    reservoirs += 1\n                    # Find the farthest hill we can cover with a reservoir\n                    farthest = right[i]\n                    while i <= farthest:\n                        farthest = max(farthest, right[i])\n                        i += 1\n        \n                results.append(reservoirs)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            heights = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n            test_cases.append((N, heights))\n            index += N + 1\n\n        minimum_reservoirs(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n\n        This revised solution correctly calculates the minimum number of reservoirs by considering the overlapping coverage of each reservoir and ensuring all hills are covered efficiently.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's address the problem by correctly implementing the logic to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed.

If no such hill exists within 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**:\n   - Start at the given hill index `i`.\n   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.\n   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.\n   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**:\n   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for each operation in operations:\n        if operation is of type 1:\n            i, k = operation parameters\n            current_index = i - 1\n            for jump in range(k):\n                next_index = -1\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        next_index = j\n                        break\n                if next_index == -1:\n                    break\n                current_index = next_index\n            print(current_index + 1)\n        \n        else if operation is of type 2:\n            L, R, X = operation parameters\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for operation in operations:\n        if operation[0] == 1:\n            # Type 1 operation\n            i, k = operation[1], operation[2]\n            current_index = i - 1\n            for _ in range(k):\n                next_index = -1\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        next_index = j\n                        break\n                if next_index == -1:\n                    break\n                current_index = next_index\n            print(current_index + 1)\n        \n        elif operation[0] == 2:\n            # Type 2 operation\n            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nN = int(data[0])\nQ = int(data[1])\nheights = list(map(int, data[2:N+2]))\noperations = []\n\nindex = N + 2\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    op_type = int(data[index])\n    if op_type == 1:\n        i = int(data[index + 1])\n        k = int(data[index + 2])\n        operations.append((1, i, k))\n        index += 3\n    elif op_type == 2:\n        L = int(data[index + 1])\n        R = int(data[index + 2])\n        X = int(data[index + 3])\n        operations.append((2, L, R, X))\n        index += 4\n\nprocess_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)\n```\n\nThis solution reads the input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the result for each Type 1 operation. The heights are updated in-place for Type 2 operations."

        "content": "In this problem, I dealt with a sequence of hills and two types of operations: jumping between hills and adjusting hill heights. The core concept was efficiently managing these operations given constraints on the number of hills and operations.\n\nFor the Type 1 operation, the challenge was to simulate jumps between hills based on height conditions. The key was to iterate over the hills to the right of the current position and find the nearest hill that is strictly higher, ensuring the search is limited to a maximum of 100 hills to the right. This required careful index management to avoid out-of-bounds errors.\n\nFor the Type 2 operation, the task was straightforward: adjust the heights of hills within a specified range. This involved iterating over the specified range and updating the heights directly.\n\nThe solution involved reading input data efficiently, processing each operation, and outputting results for Type 1 operations. The use of Python's list and range functionalities was crucial for handling the operations within the constraints. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding index-based operations and efficient iteration in large datasets."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the hill jumping competition, the approach I took was quite similar to the official solution, but there are a few insights worth noting:\n\n1. **Handling Type 1 Operations**: Both my solution and the official solution correctly iterate over the hills to find the next higher hill within a range of 100 hills. The official solution uses a `while` loop with a `temp` flag to break out of the loop once a valid jump is found, which is a slightly different approach than my nested `for` loop. This use of a flag can be a useful pattern to remember for early exits in loops.\n\n2. **Handling Type 2 Operations**: Both solutions update the heights in a straightforward manner by iterating over the specified range and adjusting the heights. This part of the problem is relatively simple and both solutions handle it efficiently.\n\n3. **Output Collection**: The official solution collects all results for Type 1 operations in a list and prints them at the end. This is a good practice for problems where output needs to be collected and printed in bulk, as it can sometimes be more efficient than printing immediately, especially in competitive programming environments.\n\nOverall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively address the requirements. The key takeaway is the use of control structures like flags for early exits in loops, which can simplify logic and improve readability."

        "content": "\n[description for function: process_operations]\nThe function processes a list of operations on an array of heights. For each operation, if the operation type is 1, it starts from a given index and moves to the next higher height up to a specified number of times, printing the final position. If the operation type is 2, it increases the heights within a specified range by a given value. The function iterates over the list of operations and applies the corresponding logic based on the operation type. It handles two types of operations: finding the k-th higher position and incrementing a range of heights. The function modifies the heights array in place for type 2 operations.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to simulate a sequence of operations on a data structure, particularly when dealing with range updates and queries. The problem involves efficiently handling two types of operations on an array: jumping to the next higher element within a certain range and updating a range of elements by a given value. This is a common pattern in competitive programming and can be applied to problems involving range queries and updates, such as those that can be solved using segment trees or binary indexed trees. Understanding how to implement these operations efficiently is crucial for handling large datasets within time constraints."
