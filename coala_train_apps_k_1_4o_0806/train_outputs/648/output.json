We need to perform two types of operations:\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**:\n   - Start at the given hill index `i`.\n   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.\n   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.\n   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**:\n   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for each operation in operations:\n        if operation is of type 1:\n            i, k = operation parameters\n            current_index = i - 1\n            for jump in range(k):\n                next_index = -1\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        next_index = j\n                        break\n                if next_index == -1:\n                    break\n                current_index = next_index\n            print(current_index + 1)\n        \n        else if operation is of type 2:\n            L, R, X = operation parameters\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for operation in operations:\n        if operation[0] == 1:\n            # Type 1 operation\n            i, k = operation[1], operation[2]\n            current_index = i - 1\n            for _ in range(k):\n                next_index = -1\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        next_index = j\n                        break\n                if next_index == -1:\n                    break\n                current_index = next_index\n            print(current_index + 1)\n        \n        elif operation[0] == 2:\n            # Type 2 operation\n            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nN = int(data[0])\nQ = int(data[1])\nheights = list(map(int, data[2:N+2]))\noperations = []\n\nindex = N + 2\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    op_type = int(data[index])\n    if op_type == 1:\n        i = int(data[index + 1])\n        k = int(data[index + 2])\n        operations.append((1, i, k))\n        index += 3\n    elif op_type == 2:\n        L = int(data[index + 1])\n        R = int(data[index + 2])\n        X = int(data[index + 3])\n        operations.append((2, L, R, X))\n        index += 4\n\nprocess_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)\n```\n\nThis solution reads the input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the result for each Type 1 operation.
