    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem involves using a greedy approach to minimize uncompleted tasks by strategically using buttons that can either reduce planned tasks or increase completed tasks. The key is to ensure that the constraints are respected: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.\n\n#### Strategies and Errors\nInitially, the strategy was to sort the buttons in descending order and apply the largest possible button to each day. However, the implementation failed to correctly update the planned and completed tasks, leading to negative uncompleted tasks, which violated the constraints.\n\nThe main error was not properly handling the constraints after each button press. The solution allowed completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, resulting in incorrect outputs.\n\n#### Fixes and Lessons Learned\nTo fix the issue, I ensured that the constraints were strictly followed by checking the conditions before applying any button. The greedy approach was maintained, but with careful checks to ensure that the constraints were not violated.\n\nThe experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding and implementing constraints in greedy algorithms. It also emphasized the need for careful debugging and validation of logic when dealing with constraint-based problems.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\nThe problem involves minimizing the number of uncompleted tasks by using a set of buttons that can either reduce planned tasks or increase completed tasks. My initial approach was to use a greedy strategy, attempting to apply the largest possible button effect each day. However, this approach failed due to incorrect handling of constraints and button application logic.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Difference Calculation**:\n   - The official solution calculates the difference between planned and completed tasks for each day upfront. This simplifies the problem to reducing these differences using the available buttons.\n\n2. **Unified Button List**:\n   - Instead of treating white and black buttons separately, the official solution combines them into a single list. This allows for a unified approach to reducing the task differences.\n\n3. **Sorting and Greedy Reduction**:\n   - Both the task differences and the combined button list are sorted. The task differences are sorted in descending order, while the button list is sorted in ascending order. This allows the solution to apply the smallest button that can reduce the largest task difference, effectively minimizing the uncompleted tasks.\n\n4. **Efficient Button Application**:\n   - The solution iterates over the sorted task differences and applies the largest possible reduction using the smallest available button. This ensures that the most significant reductions are made first, optimizing the use of available resources.\n\n#### Why the Official Solution Works:\n\n- **Simplification**: By focusing on the differences between planned and completed tasks, the problem is simplified to a single dimension, making it easier to manage.\n- **Unified Approach**: Combining the buttons into a single list allows for a more flexible and efficient application of reductions.\n- **Optimal Resource Use**: The sorting strategy ensures that the most significant task differences are addressed first, maximizing the impact of each button press.\n\nIn summary, the official solution provides a more streamlined and effective approach to the problem by simplifying the task to a single dimension and optimizing the use of available resources through sorting and a unified button list. This reflection highlights the importance of problem simplification and strategic resource allocation in algorithm design.",
