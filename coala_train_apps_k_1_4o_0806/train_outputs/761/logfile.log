## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5

4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a schedule of tasks planned over several days. For each day, he has a certain number of tasks planned and a certain number of tasks completed. Chef can use a time machine with two types of buttons: white buttons that reduce the number of planned tasks and black buttons that increase the number of completed tasks. Each button can only be used once, and there are constraints on when they can be used. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Constraints**: 
   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks for the day are greater than or equal to the button's value.
   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks for that day.

2. **Objective**: Minimize the total uncompleted tasks, which is the sum of (planned tasks - completed tasks) for all days.

3. **Approach**:
   - Sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction in planned tasks.
   - Sort the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.
   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce planned tasks.
   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase completed tasks.
   - Keep track of the total uncompleted tasks after applying the buttons.

### Pseudocode

```
function minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, M
        read planned_tasks (A)
        read completed_tasks (B)
        read white_buttons (C)
        read black_buttons (D)
        
        sort C in descending order
        sort D in descending order
        
        for each day i from 0 to N-1:
            for each white_button in C:
                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:
                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button
                    remove white_button from C
                    break
            
            for each black_button in D:
                if completed_tasks[i] + black_button <= planned_tasks[i]:
                    completed_tasks[i] += black_button
                    remove black_button from D
                    break
        
        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i] for i in range(N))
        print total_uncompleted_tasks
```

### Python Code

```python
def minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = test_case['N'], test_case['K'], test_case['M']
        planned_tasks = test_case['planned_tasks']
        completed_tasks = test_case['completed_tasks']
        white_buttons = sorted(test_case['white_buttons'], reverse=True)
        black_buttons = sorted(test_case['black_buttons'], reverse=True)
        
        # Apply white buttons
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(len(white_buttons)):
                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_buttons[j]:
                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_buttons[j]
                    white_buttons.pop(j)
                    break
        
        # Apply black buttons
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(len(black_buttons)):
                if completed_tasks[i] + black_buttons[j] <= planned_tasks[i]:
                    completed_tasks[i] += black_buttons[j]
                    black_buttons.pop(j)
                    break
        
        # Calculate total uncompleted tasks
        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i] for i in range(N))
        results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [
#     {
#         'N': 4,
#         'K': 2,
#         'M': 2,
#         'planned_tasks': [5, 7, 6, 1],
#         'completed_tasks': [3, 3, 1, 1],
#         'white_buttons': [6, 3],
#         'black_buttons': [1, 4]
#     }
# ]
# minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

This code reads the input, processes each test case by applying the buttons optimally, and outputs the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns

    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days, where each day features a different dish from a set of four options. The constraints are that consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last days must also differ. The challenge is to compute the number of such valid schedules efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    #### Strategies and Errors

    1. **Initial Approach**: The initial approach used a formula \( 4 \times 3^{(N-1)} \), which incorrectly assumed that the last day had 3 choices. This led to incorrect results for \( N > 2 \).

    2. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula is \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \). This accounts for:
       - 4 choices for the first day.
       - \( 3^{(N-2)} \) choices for the intermediate days.
       - 2 choices for the last day, ensuring it differs from both the previous day and the first day.

    3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using Python's `pow` function with three arguments allows efficient computation of large powers under a modulus, which is crucial for handling large \( N \).

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes

    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by adding a call to `main()` within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
    - **Formula Miscalculation**: The initial miscalculation of the formula was corrected by re-evaluating the constraints and adjusting the formula to \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \).

    ### Final Correct Code

    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return (4 * 3) % MOD
        else:
            # Using modular exponentiation to compute 3^(N-2) % MOD
            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)
            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    # Call the main function to execute the program
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering problem constraints and verifying the logic of mathematical formulas used in algorithmic solutions.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a time machine with buttons that can alter the number of tasks planned or completed on a given day. For each day, Chef can press one button to either reduce the planned tasks or increase the completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after all days have been processed.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Button Effects**:
   - White buttons reduce the planned tasks for a day.
   - Black buttons increase the completed tasks for a day.

2. **Constraints**:
   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.
   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - This greedy approach ensures that we maximize the reduction of uncompleted tasks.

 ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a time machine with buttons that can alter the number of tasks planned or completed on a given day. For each day, Chef can press one button to either reduce the planned tasks or increase the completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after all days have been processed.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Button Effects**:
   - White buttons reduce the planned tasks for a day.
   - Black buttons increase the completed tasks for a day.

2. **Constraints**:
   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.
   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - This greedy approach ensures that we maximize the reduction of uncompleted tasks.

### Pseudocode

```
function minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons = test_case
        
        sort white_buttons in descending order
        sort black_buttons in descending order
        
        for each day i from 0 to N-1:
            for each white_button in white_buttons:
                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:
                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button
                    remove white_button from white_buttons
                    break
            
            for each black_button in black_buttons:
                if completed_tasks[i] + black_button <= planned_tasks[i]:
                    completed_tasks[i] += black_button

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
   - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
   - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
   - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Correct Button Application**:
   - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
   - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

    M = int(data[index + 2])
    planned_tasks = list(map(int, data[index + 3:index + 3 + N]))
    completed_tasks = list(map(int, data[index + 3 + N:index + 3 + 2 * N]))
    white_buttons = list(map(int, data[index + 3 + 2 * N:index + 3 + 2 * N + K]))
    black_buttons = list(map(int, data[index + 3 + 2 * N + K:index + 3 + 2 * N + K + M]))
    index += 3 + 2 * N + K + M
    test_cases.append((N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons))

minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

This revised code should correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons, ensuring that the number of uncompleted tasks is minimized without violating any constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a time machine with buttons that can alter the number of tasks planned or completed on a given day. For each day, Chef can press one button to either reduce the planned tasks or increase the completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after all days have been processed.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Button Effects**:
   - White buttons reduce the planned tasks for a day.
   - Black buttons increase the completed tasks for a day.

2. **Constraints**:
   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.
   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - This greedy approach ensures that we maximize the reduction of uncompleted tasks.

### Pseudocode

    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons = test_case
        
        sort white_buttons in descending order
        sort black_buttons in descending order

            for each white_button in white_buttons:
                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:
                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button
                    remove white_button from white_buttons

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
   - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
   - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
   - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Correct Button Application**:
   - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
   - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons = test_case
        
        sort white_buttons in descending order
        sort black_buttons in descending order
        
        for each day i from 0 to N-1:
            for each white_button in white_buttons:
                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:
                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.

 Let's address the issue in the previous solution by ensuring that the constraints are properly handled and the logic for using the buttons is correctly implemented. Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
def minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons = test_case

### Key Fixes:
- **Correct Button Usage**: Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
- **Constraint Handling**: Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.
- **Greedy Approach**: The greedy approach is maintained but with careful checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated.

This code should now correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons, ensuring that the number of uncompleted tasks is minimized without violating any constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a time machine with buttons that can alter the number of tasks planned or completed on a given day. For each day, Chef can press one button to either reduce the planned tasks or increase the completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after all days have been processed.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Button Effects**:
   - White buttons reduce the planned tasks for a day.
   - Black buttons increase the completed tasks for a day.

2. **Constraints**:
   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.
   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - This greedy approach ensures that we maximize the reduction of uncompleted tasks.

### Pseudocode

function minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):

        sort white_buttons in descending order
        sort black_buttons in descending order

            for each white_button in white_buttons:
                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:
                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button
                    remove white_button from white_buttons
                    break

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
   - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
   - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
   - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Correct Button Application**:
   - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
   - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's address the issue in the previous solution by ensuring that the constraints are properly handled and the logic for using the buttons is correctly implemented. Here's the corrected Python code:

### Key Fixes:
- **Correct Button Usage**: Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
- **Constraint Handling**: Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.
- **Greedy Approach**: The greedy approach is maintained but with careful checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated.

This code should now correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons, ensuring that the number of uncompleted tasks is minimized without violating any constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
   - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
   - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
   - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Correct Button Application**:
   - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
   - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a time machine with buttons that can alter the number of tasks planned or completed on a given day. For each day, Chef can press one button to either reduce the planned tasks or increase the completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after all days have been processed.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Button Effects**:
   - White buttons reduce the planned tasks for a day.
   - Black buttons increase the completed tasks for a day.

2. **Constraints**:
   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.
   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - This greedy approach ensures that we maximize the reduction of uncompleted tasks.

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
   - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
   - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
   - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Correct Button Application**:
   - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
   - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

### Revised Pseudocode

    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons = test_case
        
        sort white_buttons in descending order
        sort black_buttons in descending order
        
        for each day i from 0 to N-1:
            for each white_button in white_buttons:
                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:
                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button
                    remove white_button from white_buttons

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.

    test_cases.append((N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons))

minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Fixes:
- **Correct Button Usage**: Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
- **Constraint Handling**: Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.
- **Greedy Approach**: The greedy approach is maintained but with careful checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated.

This code should now correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons, ensuring that the number of uncompleted tasks is minimized without violating any constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a time machine with buttons that can alter the number of tasks planned or completed on a given day. For each day, Chef can press one button to either reduce the planned tasks or increase the completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after all days have been processed.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Button Effects**:
   - White buttons reduce the planned tasks for a day.
   - Black buttons increase the completed tasks for a day.

2. **Constraints**:
   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.
   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - This greedy approach ensures that we maximize the reduction of uncompleted tasks.

### Pseudocode

        N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons = test_case

        sort black_buttons in descending order

                    remove white_button from white_buttons

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
   - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
   - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
   - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Correct Button Application**:
   - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
   - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's address the issue in the previous solution by ensuring that the constraints are properly handled and the logic for using the buttons is correctly implemented. Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
def minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons = test_case
        
        # Sort buttons in descending order

### Key Fixes:
- **Correct Button Usage**: Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
- **Constraint Handling**: Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.
- **Greedy Approach**: The greedy approach is maintained but with careful checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated.

This code should now correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons, ensuring that the number of uncompleted tasks is minimized without violating any constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The current solution is not correctly handling the constraints and logic for using the buttons, leading to incorrect results. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
   - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
   - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
   - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Correct Button Application**:
   - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
   - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

### Revised Approach

1. **Sort the Buttons**: Sort both white and black buttons in descending order to maximize their effect.
2. **Iterate Over Days**: For each day, try to apply the largest possible white button first, then the largest possible black button.
3. **Update Tasks**: Ensure that the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly after each button press.
4. **Calculate Uncompleted Tasks**: After processing all days, calculate the total uncompleted tasks.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a time machine with buttons that can alter the number of tasks planned or completed on a given day. For each day, Chef can press one button to either reduce the planned tasks or increase the completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after all days have been processed.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Button Effects**:
   - White buttons reduce the planned tasks for a day.
   - Black buttons increase the completed tasks for a day.

2. **Constraints**:
   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.
   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - This greedy approach ensures that we maximize the reduction of uncompleted tasks.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
   - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
   - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
   - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Correct Button Application**:
   - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
   - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons = test_case
        
        sort white_buttons in descending order
        sort black_buttons in descending order
        
        for each day i from 0 to N-1:
            for each white_button in white_buttons:
                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:
                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button
                    remove white_button from white_buttons
                    break
            
            for each black_button in black_buttons:
                if completed_tasks[i] + black_button <= planned_tasks[i]:
                    completed_tasks[i] += black_button

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] Let's address the issue in the previous solution by ensuring that the constraints are properly handled and the logic for using the buttons is correctly implemented. Here's the corrected Python code:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a time machine with buttons that can alter the number of tasks planned or completed on a given day. For each day, Chef can press one button to either reduce the planned tasks or increase the completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after all days have been processed.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Button Effects**:
   - White buttons reduce the planned tasks for a day.
   - Black buttons increase the completed tasks for a day.

2. **Constraints**:
   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.
   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - This greedy approach ensures that we maximize the reduction of uncompleted tasks.

### Pseudocode

```
function minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons = test_case
        
        sort white_buttons in descending order
        sort black_buttons in descending order
        
        for each day i from 0 to N-1:
            for each white_button in white_buttons:
                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:
                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button
                    remove white_button from white_buttons
                    break
            
            for each black_button in black_buttons:
                if completed_tasks[i] + black_button <= planned_tasks[i]:
                    completed_tasks[i] += black_button
                    remove black_button from black_buttons
                    break
        
        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i] for i from 0 to N-1)
        print total_uncompleted_tasks
```

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
   - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
   - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
   - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Correct Button Application**:
   - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
   - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem involves using a greedy approach to minimize uncompleted tasks by strategically using buttons that can either reduce planned tasks or increase completed tasks. The key is to ensure that the constraints are respected: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

#### Strategies and Errors
Initially, the strategy was to sort the buttons in descending order and apply the largest possible button to each day. However, the implementation failed to correctly update the planned and completed tasks, leading to negative uncompleted tasks, which violated the constraints.

The main error was not properly handling the constraints after each button press. The solution allowed completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, resulting in incorrect outputs.

#### Fixes and Lessons Learned
To fix the issue, I ensured that the constraints were strictly followed by checking the conditions before applying any button. The greedy approach was maintained, but with careful checks to ensure that the constraints were not violated.

The experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding and implementing constraints in greedy algorithms. It also emphasized the need for careful debugging and validation of logic when dealing with constraint-based problems.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a time machine with buttons that can alter the number of tasks planned or completed on a given day. For each day, Chef can press one button to either reduce the planned tasks or increase the completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after all days have been processed.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Button Effects**:
   - White buttons reduce the planned tasks for a day.
   - Black buttons increase the completed tasks for a day.

2. **Constraints**:
   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value.
   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - This greedy approach ensures that we maximize the reduction of uncompleted tasks.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
   - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
   - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
   - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Correct Button Application**:
   - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
   - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

### Revised Pseudocode

### Key Fixes:
- **Correct Button Usage**: Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
- **Constraint Handling**: Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.
- **Greedy Approach**: The greedy approach is maintained but with careful checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated.

This code should now correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons, ensuring that the number of uncompleted tasks is minimized without violating any constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
   - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
   - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
   - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Correct Button Application**:
   - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
   - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
   - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem and Solution

The problem involves minimizing the number of uncompleted tasks by using a set of buttons that can either reduce planned tasks or increase completed tasks. My initial approach was to use a greedy strategy, attempting to apply the largest possible button effect each day. However, this approach failed due to incorrect handling of constraints and button application logic.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The official solution calculates the difference between planned and completed tasks for each day upfront. This simplifies the problem to reducing these differences using the available buttons.

2. **Unified Button List**:
   - Instead of treating white and black buttons separately, the official solution combines them into a single list. This allows for a unified approach to reducing the task differences.

3. **Sorting and Greedy Reduction**:
   - Both the task differences and the combined button list are sorted. The task differences are sorted in descending order, while the button list is sorted in ascending order. This allows the solution to apply the smallest button that can reduce the largest task difference, effectively minimizing the uncompleted tasks.

4. **Efficient Button Application**:
   - The solution iterates over the sorted task differences and applies the largest possible reduction using the smallest available button. This ensures that the most significant reductions are made first, optimizing the use of available resources.

#### Why the Official Solution Works:

- **Simplification**: By focusing on the differences between planned and completed tasks, the problem is simplified to a single dimension, making it easier to manage.
- **Unified Approach**: Combining the buttons into a single list allows for a more flexible and efficient application of reductions.
- **Optimal Resource Use**: The sorting strategy ensures that the most significant task differences are addressed first, maximizing the impact of each button press.

In summary, the official solution provides a more streamlined and effective approach to the problem by simplifying the task to a single dimension and optimizing the use of available resources through sorting and a unified button list. This reflection highlights the importance of problem simplification and strategic resource allocation in algorithm design.
