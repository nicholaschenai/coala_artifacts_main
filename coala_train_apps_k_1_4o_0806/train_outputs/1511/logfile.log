## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'

2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a row of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is calculated as `P = K + 1 - |j-i| - S`, where `|j-i|` is the distance between the magnet and iron, and `S` is the number of conducting sheets between them. The attraction is only possible if `P > 0` and there are no blocks ('X') between them. We need to find the maximum number of such magnet-iron pairs for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation**: First, split the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.
2. **Pairing**: For each segment, attempt to pair magnets and irons:
   - Use two lists to track the positions of magnets and irons.
   - Iterate through the segment, and for each magnet, try to find the nearest iron that can be attracted.
   - Calculate the attraction power considering the distance and the number of conducting sheets.
   - If the attraction power is positive, pair the magnet with the iron and remove both from their respective lists.
3. **Count Pairs**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the total result of the test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_magnets(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test case:
        N, K, S = test case
        segments = split S by 'X'
        total_pairs = 0
        for each segment in segments:
            magnets = []
            irons = []
            sheets_count = 0
            for each character in segment:
                if character is 'M':
                    add position to magnets
                if character is 'I':
                    add position to irons
                if character is ':':
                    increment sheets_count
            while both magnets and irons are not empty:
                magnet_pos = first element in magnets
                iron_pos = first element in irons
                distance = abs(magnet_pos - iron_pos)
                if magnet_pos < iron_pos:
                    sheets_between = count sheets between magnet_pos and iron_pos
                else:
                    sheets_between = count sheets between iron_pos and magnet_pos
                attraction_power = K + 1 - distance - sheets_between
                if attraction_power > 0:
                    increment total_pairs
                    remove first element from magnets
                    remove first element from irons
                else:
                    if magnet_pos < iron_pos:
                        remove first element from magnets
                    else:
                        remove first element from irons
        append total_pairs to results
    return results

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:

- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a blocked cell ('X'). Magnets can attract iron pieces if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. The attraction power is calculated as `P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}`, where `S_{i,j}` is the number of conducting sheets between the magnet and the iron. We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron pieces for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation**: First, split the sequence into segments separated by blocked cells ('X'), as no attraction can occur across these cells.

2. **Attraction Calculation**: For each segment, calculate the attraction power between each magnet and each iron piece. If the power is positive, consider this pair for attraction.

3. **Greedy Pairing**: Use a greedy approach to pair magnets and iron pieces within each segment. Start with the closest pairs and move outward, ensuring each iron and magnet is used at most once.

4. **Count Maximum Pairs**: For each segment, count the maximum number of valid magnet-iron pairs and sum these counts for the final result.

### Pseudocode

        for each segment in segments:
            magnets = indices of 'M' in segment
            irons = indices of 'I' in segment
            sheets = prefix sum of ':' in segment
            
            i, j = 0, 0
            while i < len(magnets) and j < len(irons):
                m = magnets[i]
                iron = irons[j]
                num_sheets = sheets[max(m, iron)] - sheets[min(m, iron)]
                power = K + 1 - abs(m - iron) - num_sheets
                
                if power > 0:
                    total_pairs += 1
                    i += 1
                    j += 1
                elif m < iron:
                    i += 1
                else:

 ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a blocked cell ('X'). Magnets can attract iron pieces if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. The attraction power is calculated as `P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}`, where `S_{i,j}` is the number of conducting sheets between the magnet and the iron. We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron pieces for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation**: First, split the sequence into segments separated by blocked cells ('X'), as no attraction can occur across these cells.

2. **Attraction Calculation**: For each segment, calculate the attraction power between each magnet and each iron piece. If the power is positive, consider this pair for attraction.

3. **Greedy Pairing**: Use a greedy approach to pair magnets and iron pieces within each segment. Start with the closest pairs and move outward, ensuring each iron and magnet is used at most once.

4. **Count Maximum Pairs**: For each segment, count the maximum number of valid magnet-iron pairs and sum these counts for the final result.

            magnets = indices of 'M' in segment
            irons = indices of 'I' in segment
            sheets = prefix sum of ':' in segment

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
4 5
I::M
9 10
MIM_XII:M

-----Example Output-----
1
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently pair magnets ('M') and iron pieces ('I') in a sequence, considering the constraints of attraction power and blocked cells ('X'). The key challenge was to handle the attraction power calculation, which depends on the distance between the magnet and iron, the number of conducting sheets (':') between them, and the given constant `K`.

The successful strategy involved segmenting the sequence by blocked cells, as no attraction can occur across these. Within each segment, I used a greedy approach to pair magnets and iron pieces by calculating the attraction power and ensuring it was positive. This involved maintaining lists of indices for magnets and irons and a prefix sum array for conducting sheets to quickly calculate the number of sheets between any two positions.

The solution was efficient due to the use of two-pointer technique to traverse the lists of magnets and irons, ensuring each was used at most once. This approach allowed the solution to handle the constraints effectively, especially given the large possible input sizes.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of segmenting problems into manageable parts and using efficient data structures and algorithms to handle constraints, such as prefix sums for quick range queries.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
4 5
I::M
9 10
MIM_XII:M

-----Example Output-----
1
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a blocked cell ('X'). Magnets can attract iron pieces if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. The attraction power is calculated as `P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}`, where `S_{i,j}` is the number of conducting sheets between the magnet and the iron. We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron pieces for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation**: First, split the sequence into segments separated by blocked cells ('X'), as no attraction can occur across these cells.

2. **Attraction Calculation**: For each segment, calculate the attraction power between each magnet and each iron piece. If the power is positive, consider this pair for attraction.

3. **Greedy Pairing**: Use a greedy approach to pair magnets and iron pieces within each segment. Start with the closest pairs and move outward, ensuring each iron and magnet is used at most once.

4. **Count Maximum Pairs**: For each segment, count the maximum number of valid magnet-iron pairs and sum these counts for the final result.

### Pseudocode

```
function max_magnets(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, S = test_case
        segments = split S by 'X'
        total_pairs = 0
        
        for each segment in segments:
            magnets = indices of 'M' in segment
            irons = indices of 'I' in segment
            sheets = prefix sum of ':' in segment
            
            i, j = 0, 0
            while i < len(magnets) and j < len(irons):
                m = magnets[i]
                iron = irons[j]
                num_sheets = sheets[max(m, iron)] - sheets[min(m, iron)]
                power = K + 1 - abs(m - iron) - num_sheets
                
                if power > 0:
                    total_pairs += 1
                    i += 1
                    j += 1
                elif m < iron:
                    i += 1
                else:
                    j += 1
        
        print total_pairs
```

    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, S = test_case

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] The problem of pairing magnets and iron pieces with constraints was an interesting challenge. Here's a reflection on the approach and insights gained:

### Key Insights

1. **Segmentation by Blocked Cells**: Both my solution and the official solution effectively handle segments separated by 'X' (blocked cells). This is crucial because no attraction can occur across these cells, simplifying the problem into smaller, independent subproblems.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: The official solution uses a two-pointer technique to traverse the string, which is efficient for this type of problem. This approach allows simultaneous consideration of magnets and iron pieces, making it easier to find valid pairs.

3. **Counting Conducting Sheets**: Both solutions correctly account for conducting sheets (':') between magnets and iron pieces, which affect the attraction power. The official solution does this by counting the sheets between the two pointers whenever a potential pair is found.

4. **Greedy Pairing**: The official solution uses a greedy approach to pair magnets and iron pieces, similar to my approach. It checks the attraction power and pairs them if the power is positive, ensuring each magnet and iron piece is used at most once.

### Differences and Improvements

- **Efficiency**: The official solution is concise and directly manipulates indices, which might be slightly more efficient in terms of space compared to maintaining separate lists for magnets and irons as in my solution.
  
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution handles edge cases like encountering 'X' more seamlessly by resetting pointers, which is a neat way to ensure no invalid pairs are considered.

### Conclusion

The official solution is a well-optimized approach that effectively uses the two-pointer technique and greedy pairing strategy. It reinforces the importance of segmenting problems and efficiently managing indices in string processing tasks. This problem was a good exercise in applying these techniques to maximize pairings under constraints.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently pair magnets ('M') and iron pieces ('I') in a sequence, considering the constraints of attraction power and blocked cells ('X'). The key challenge was to handle the attraction power calculation, which depends on the distance between the magnet ...,
