    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\nChef has a series of segments, each defined by two integers [L, R]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by sequentially transforming each segment into the next one. The transformation involves shifting the borders of the segment by one unit at a time, either increasing or decreasing L or R. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to achieve this transformation and to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to transform each segment into the next one in the sequence. For each transformation from segment [Li, Ri] to [Li+1, Ri+1], we need to:\n- Adjust Li to Li+1 using the minimal number of operations.\n- Adjust Ri to Ri+1 using the minimal number of operations.\n\nFor each segment transformation:\n- If Li < Li+1, perform (Li+1 - Li) \"L+\" operations.\n- If Li > Li+1, perform (Li - Li+1) \"L-\" operations.\n- If Ri < Ri+1, perform (Ri+1 - Ri) \"R+\" operations.\n- If Ri > Ri+1, perform (Ri - Ri+1) \"R-\" operations.\n\nWe repeat this process for each pair of consecutive segments and concatenate the operations to form the final sequence.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n```\nfunction transform_segments(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N\n        read segments as a list of pairs (Li, Ri)\n        \n        initialize total_operations to 0\n        initialize operations_sequence to an empty string\n        \n        for i from 0 to N-2:\n            current_segment = segments[i]\n            next_segment = segments[i+1]\n            \n            calculate L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]\n            calculate R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]\n            \n            if L_diff > 0:\n                append \"L+\" * L_diff to operations_sequence\n            else if L_diff < 0:\n                append \"L-\" * abs(L_diff) to operations_sequence\n            \n            if R_diff > 0:\n                append \"R+\" * R_diff to operations_sequence\n            else if R_diff < 0:\n                append \"R-\" * abs(R_diff) to operations_sequence\n            \n            update total_operations by adding abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)\n        \n        print total_operations\n        print operations_sequence\n```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef transform_segments(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, segments = test_case\n        total_operations = 0\n        operations_sequence = []\n        \n        # Iterate over each pair of consecutive segments\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            current_segment = segments[i]\n            next_segment = segments[i + 1]\n            \n            # Calculate the difference in L and R\n            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]\n            R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]\n            \n            # Adjust L\n            if L_diff > 0:\n                operations_sequence.append(\"L+\" * L_diff)\n            elif L_diff < 0:\n                operations_sequence.append(\"L-\" * (-L_diff))\n            \n            # Adjust R\n            if R_diff > 0:\n                operations_sequence.append(\"R+\" * R_diff)\n            elif R_diff < 0:\n                operations_sequence.append(\"R-\" * (-R_diff))\n            \n            # Update the total number of operations\n            total_operations += abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))\n    \n    # Output all results\n    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:\n        print(total_operations)\n        print(operations_sequence)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    segments = []\n    for _ in range(N):\n        L, R = int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2])\n        segments.append((L, R))\n        index += 2\n    test_cases.append((N, segments))\n\ntransform_segments(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads the input, processes each test case to compute the minimal sequence of operations, and outputs the results.",
