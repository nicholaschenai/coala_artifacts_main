    "summary": "In tackling the problem of transforming segments with minimal operations, the core concept was to ensure that the sequence of operations is both minimal in number and lexicographically smallest. The operations allowed were \"L+\", \"L-\", \"R+\", and \"R-\", and the challenge was to apply these in the correct order to achieve the desired transformation.\n\nInitially, the solution focused on calculating the differences between consecutive segments and applying operations based on these differences. However, the key mistake was not ensuring the correct lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be applied in the order of \"R+\", \"L+\", \"R-\", \"L-\" to ensure the sequence is lexicographically minimal.\n\nThe main learning point was the importance of operation order in achieving the correct lexicographical sequence. The solution was adjusted to prioritize \"R+\" and \"L+\" before \"R-\" and \"L-\", which resolved the issue. Additionally, ensuring that the operations sequence is reset for each test case was crucial to avoid carry-over errors between test cases.\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of understanding both the numerical and lexicographical requirements of a problem and ensuring that both are addressed in the solution.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Lexicographical Order:**\n   - The official solution emphasizes the importance of lexicographical order by prioritizing \"L+\" and \"L-\" operations before \"R+\" and \"R-\". This ensures that the sequence of operations is not only minimal in number but also lexicographically smallest. My initial attempts did not correctly prioritize these operations, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n2. **Iterative Adjustment:**\n   - The official solution uses a while loop to iteratively adjust the segment borders until they match the target segment. This approach is more flexible and ensures that each operation is applied in the correct order based on the current state of the segment. My approach attempted to calculate the differences and apply operations in bulk, which did not account for the need to maintain a valid segment throughout the transformation.\n\n3. **Handling Constraints:**\n   - The official solution carefully checks conditions like `a + 1 < b` and `b - 1 > a` to ensure that operations do not result in an invalid (empty) segment. This is crucial for maintaining valid segments throughout the transformation process.\n\n4. **Learning from Mistakes:**\n   - My initial solutions failed to pass the test cases because they did not correctly handle the order of operations and did not ensure the segment remained valid after each operation. The official solution's step-by-step approach and careful condition checks provide a robust method for solving the problem.\n\nIn future problem-solving scenarios, it is important to:\n- Pay close attention to the order of operations, especially when lexicographical order is a requirement.\n- Consider iterative approaches that adjust the state step-by-step, rather than attempting to apply changes in bulk.\n- Ensure that all constraints are respected throughout the process to maintain valid states.",
