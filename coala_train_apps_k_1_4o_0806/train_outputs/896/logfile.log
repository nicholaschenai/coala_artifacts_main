## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, each defined by two integers [Li, Ri]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by performing a series of operations on the segments in sequence. The operations allowed are shifting the left or right border of a segment by one unit, either increasing or decreasing it. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: 
   - You can increase or decrease the left or right border of a segment.
   - You cannot make a segment empty (i.e., L should never equal R).

2. **Transformation Process**:
   - For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment.
   - Calculate the difference in the left and right borders between the current and next segment.
   - Use the minimal number of operations to adjust the borders to match the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest one. The order of operations is: L+, L-, R+, R-.

4. **Iterate Over Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, read the number of segments and the segments themselves.
   - For each segment, compute the operations needed to transform it into the next segment.
   - Accumulate the operations and count them.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the total number of operations and the sequence of operations.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        operations = []
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            while current_segment != next_segment:
                if current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                    operations.append("L+")
                    current_segment.L += 1
                elif current_segment.L > next_segment.L:
                    operations.append("L-")
                    current_segment.L -= 1
                elif current_segment.R < next_segment.R:
                    operations.append("R+")
                    current_segment.R += 1
                elif current_segment.R > next_segment.R:
                    operations.append("R-")
                    current_segment.R -= 1
        print number of operations
        print operations as a string
```

### Python Code

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = []
        
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_L, current_R = segments[i]
            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Transform current segment to the next segment
            while current_L != next_L or current_R != next_R:
                if current_L < next_L:
                    operations.append("L+")
                    current_L += 1
                elif current_L > next_L:
                    operations.append("L-")
                    current_L -= 1
                elif current_R < next_R:
                    operations.append("R+")
                    current_R += 1
                elif current_R > next_R:
                    operations.append("R-")
                    current_R -= 1
        
        results.append((len(operations), ''.join(operations)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result[0])
        print(result[1])

# Example usage:
# T = 4
# test_cases = [
#     (3, [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (3, 5)]),
#     (1, [(0, 1)]),
#     (3, [(-2, -1), (-2, -1), (-2, 0)]),
#     (4, [(4, 6), (3, 5), (-1, 1), (1, 2)])
# ]
# transform_segments(T, test_cases)
```

This code reads the number of test cases and segments, then iteratively transforms each segment to the next one using the minimal number of operations, while ensuring the operations are lexicographically minimal. The results are printed for each test case.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

Chef has a series of segments, each defined by two integers [L, R]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by sequentially transforming each segment into the next one. The transformation involves shifting the borders of the segment by one unit at a time, either increasing or decreasing L or R. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to achieve this transformation and to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

To solve this problem, we need to transform each segment into the next one in the sequence. For each transformation from segment [Li, Ri] to [Li+1, Ri+1], we need to:
- Adjust Li to Li+1 using the minimal number of operations.
- Adjust Ri to Ri+1 using the minimal number of operations.

For each segment transformation:
- If Li < Li+1, perform (Li+1 - Li) "L+" operations.
- If Li > Li+1, perform (Li - Li+1) "L-" operations.
- If Ri < Ri+1, perform (Ri+1 - Ri) "R+" operations.
- If Ri > Ri+1, perform (Ri - Ri+1) "R-" operations.

We repeat this process for each pair of consecutive segments and concatenate the operations to form the final sequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments as a list of pairs (Li, Ri)
        
        initialize total_operations to 0
        initialize operations_sequence to an empty string
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            calculate L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            calculate R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            if L_diff > 0:
                append "L+" * L_diff to operations_sequence
            else if L_diff < 0:
                append "L-" * abs(L_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            if R_diff > 0:
                append "R+" * R_diff to operations_sequence
            else if R_diff < 0:
                append "R-" * abs(R_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            update total_operations by adding abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

Chef has a series of segments, each defined by two integers [L, R]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by sequentially transforming each segment into the next one. The transformation involves shifting the borders of the segment by one unit at a time, either increasing or decreasing L or R. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to achieve this transformation and to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

To solve this problem, we need to transform each segment into the next one in the sequence. For each transformation from segment [Li, Ri] to [Li+1, Ri+1], we need to:
- Adjust Li to Li+1 using the minimal number of operations.
- Adjust Ri to Ri+1 using the minimal number of operations.

For each segment transformation:
- If Li < Li+1, perform (Li+1 - Li) "L+" operations.
- If Li > Li+1, perform (Li - Li+1) "L-" operations.
- If Ri < Ri+1, perform (Ri+1 - Ri) "R+" operations.
- If Ri > Ri+1, perform (Ri - Ri+1) "R-" operations.

We repeat this process for each pair of consecutive segments and concatenate the operations to form the final sequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments as a list of pairs (Li, Ri)
        
        initialize total_operations to 0
        initialize operations_sequence to an empty string
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            calculate L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            calculate R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            if L_diff > 0:
                append "L+" * L_diff to operations_sequence
            else if L_diff < 0:
                append "L-" * abs(L_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            if R_diff > 0:
                append "R+" * R_diff to operations_sequence
            else if R_diff < 0:
                append "R-" * abs(R_diff) to operations_sequence

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1
1 2

Output:

R+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+
0

R+
13
L-R-L-L-L-L-R-R-R-R-L+R+L+

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform each segment [Li, Ri] into the next segment [Li+1, Ri+1] using the minimal number of operations.
   - The operations are: "L+" (increment L), "L-" (decrement L), "R+" (increment R), "R-" (decrement R).
   - The sequence of operations should be lexicographically minimal if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over each pair of consecutive segments and calculates the difference in L and R.
   - It then appends the required operations to a list and counts the total number of operations.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The solution might not be correctly handling the lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be ordered as "L+", "L-", "R+", "R-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.
   - The solution might not be correctly resetting or initializing variables for each test case, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Correct the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the operations are appended in the correct lexicographical order.
   - Verify that the operations sequence is correctly reset for each test case.
   - Check that the total number of operations is correctly calculated and reset for each test case.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        total_operations = 0
        operations_sequence = []
        
        # Iterate over each pair of consecutive segments
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the difference in L and R
            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            # Adjust L first for lexicographical order
            if L_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L+" * L_diff)
            elif L_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L-" * (-L_diff))
            
            # Adjust R
            if R_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R+" * R_diff)
            elif R_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R-" * (-R_diff))
            
            # Update the total number of operations
            total_operations += abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    # Output all results
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    segments = []
    for _ in range(N):
        L, R = int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2])
        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append((N, segments))

transform_segments(T, test_cases)
```

This revised solution ensures that the operations are appended in the correct lexicographical order and that variables are correctly reset for each test case.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:

-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

Chef has a series of segments, each defined by two integers [L, R]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by sequentially transforming each segment into the next one. The transformation involves shifting the borders of the segment by one unit at a time, either increasing or decreasing L or R. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to achieve this transformation and to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

To solve this problem, we need to transform each segment into the next one in the sequence. For each transformation from segment [Li, Ri] to [Li+1, Ri+1], we need to:
- Adjust Li to Li+1 using the minimal number of operations.
- Adjust Ri to Ri+1 using the minimal number of operations.

For each segment transformation:
- If Li < Li+1, perform (Li+1 - Li) "L+" operations.
- If Li > Li+1, perform (Li - Li+1) "L-" operations.
- If Ri < Ri+1, perform (Ri+1 - Ri) "R+" operations.
- If Ri > Ri+1, perform (Ri - Ri+1) "R-" operations.

We repeat this process for each pair of consecutive segments and concatenate the operations to form the final sequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments as a list of pairs (Li, Ri)
        
        initialize total_operations to 0
        initialize operations_sequence to an empty string
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            calculate L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            calculate R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            if L_diff > 0:
                append "L+" * L_diff to operations_sequence
            else if L_diff < 0:
                append "L-" * abs(L_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            if R_diff > 0:
                append "R+" * R_diff to operations_sequence
            else if R_diff < 0:
                append "R-" * abs(R_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            update total_operations by adding abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python

    results = []

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform each segment [Li, Ri] into the next segment [Li+1, Ri+1] using the minimal number of operations.
   - The operations are: "L+" (increment L), "L-" (decrement L), "R+" (increment R), "R-" (decrement R).
   - The sequence of operations should be lexicographically minimal if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over each pair of consecutive segments and calculates the difference in L and R.
   - It then appends the required operations to a list and counts the total number of operations.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The solution might not be correctly handling the lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be ordered as "L+", "L-", "R+", "R-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.
   - The solution might not be correctly resetting or initializing variables for each test case, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Correct the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the operations are appended in the correct lexicographical order.
   - Verify that the operations sequence is correctly reset for each test case.
   - Check that the total number of operations is correctly calculated and reset for each test case.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        total_operations = 0

        # Iterate over each pair of consecutive segments

            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the difference in L and R
            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            # Adjust L first for lexicographical order
            if L_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L+" * L_diff)
            elif L_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L-" * (-L_diff))
            
            # Adjust R
            if R_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R+" * R_diff)
            elif R_diff < 0:

            # Update the total number of operations
            total_operations += abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    # Output all results
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Read input

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1
1 2

Output:
9
R+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+
0

1
R+
13
L-R-L-L-L-L-R-R-R-R-L+R+L+

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

Chef has a series of segments, each defined by two integers [L, R]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by sequentially transforming each segment into the next one. The transformation involves shifting the borders of the segment by one unit at a time, either increasing or decreasing L or R. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to achieve this transformation and to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

To solve this problem, we need to transform each segment into the next one in the sequence. For each transformation from segment [Li, Ri] to [Li+1, Ri+1], we need to:
- Adjust Li to Li+1 using the minimal number of operations.
- Adjust Ri to Ri+1 using the minimal number of operations.

For each segment transformation:
- If Li < Li+1, perform (Li+1 - Li) "L+" operations.
- If Li > Li+1, perform (Li - Li+1) "L-" operations.
- If Ri < Ri+1, perform (Ri+1 - Ri) "R+" operations.
- If Ri > Ri+1, perform (Ri - Ri+1) "R-" operations.

We repeat this process for each pair of consecutive segments and concatenate the operations to form the final sequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments as a list of pairs (Li, Ri)
        
        initialize total_operations to 0
        initialize operations_sequence to an empty string
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            calculate L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            calculate R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            if L_diff > 0:
                append "L+" * L_diff to operations_sequence
            else if L_diff < 0:
                append "L-" * abs(L_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            if R_diff > 0:
                append "R+" * R_diff to operations_sequence
            else if R_diff < 0:
                append "R-" * abs(R_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            update total_operations by adding abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        total_operations = 0

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform each segment [Li, Ri] into the next segment [Li+1, Ri+1] using the minimal number of operations.
   - The operations are: "L+" (increment L), "L-" (decrement L), "R+" (increment R), "R-" (decrement R).
   - The sequence of operations should be lexicographically minimal if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over each pair of consecutive segments and calculates the difference in L and R.
   - It then appends the required operations to a list and counts the total number of operations.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The solution might not be correctly handling the lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be ordered as "L+", "L-", "R+", "R-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.
   - The solution might not be correctly resetting or initializing variables for each test case, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Correct the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the operations are appended in the correct lexicographical order.
   - Verify that the operations sequence is correctly reset for each test case.
   - Check that the total number of operations is correctly calculated and reset for each test case.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        total_operations = 0
        operations_sequence = []
        
        # Iterate over each pair of consecutive segments
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the difference in L and R
            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            # Adjust L first for lexicographical order
            if L_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L+" * L_diff)
            elif L_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L-" * (-L_diff))
            
            # Adjust R
            if R_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R+" * R_diff)
            elif R_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R-" * (-R_diff))
            
            # Update the total number of operations
            total_operations += abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    # Output all results
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Read input

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []

        segments.append((L, R))

   - It then appends the required operations to a list and counts the total number of operations.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The solution might not be correctly handling the lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be ordered as "L+", "L-", "R+", "R-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.
   - The solution might not be correctly resetting or initializing variables for each test case, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Correct the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the operations are appended in the correct lexicographical order.
   - Verify that the operations sequence is correctly reset for each test case.
   - Check that the total number of operations is correctly calculated and reset for each test case.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        total_operations = 0
        operations_sequence = []
        
        # Iterate over each pair of consecutive segments
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the difference in L and R
            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            # Adjust L first for lexicographical order
            if L_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L+" * L_diff)
            elif L_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L-" * (-L_diff))
            
            # Adjust R
            if R_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R+" * R_diff)
            elif R_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R-" * (-R_diff))
            
            # Update the total number of operations
            total_operations += abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    # Output all results
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    segments = []
    for _ in range(N):
        L, R = int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2])
        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append((N, segments))

transform_segments(T, test_cases)
```

This code should correctly handle the transformation of segments by ensuring that operations are applied in the correct order and that the sequence of operations is reset for each test case.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1
1 2

Output:

R+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+
0

13
L-R-L-L-L-L-R-R-R-R-L+R+L+

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

Chef has a series of segments, each defined by two integers [L, R]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by sequentially transforming each segment into the next one. The transformation involves shifting the borders of the segment by one unit at a time, either increasing or decreasing L or R. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to achieve this transformation and to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

To solve this problem, we need to transform each segment into the next one in the sequence. For each transformation from segment [Li, Ri] to [Li+1, Ri+1], we need to:
- Adjust Li to Li+1 using the minimal number of operations.
- Adjust Ri to Ri+1 using the minimal number of operations.

For each segment transformation:
- If Li < Li+1, perform (Li+1 - Li) "L+" operations.
- If Li > Li+1, perform (Li - Li+1) "L-" operations.
- If Ri < Ri+1, perform (Ri+1 - Ri) "R+" operations.
- If Ri > Ri+1, perform (Ri - Ri+1) "R-" operations.

We repeat this process for each pair of consecutive segments and concatenate the operations to form the final sequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments as a list of pairs (Li, Ri)
        
        initialize total_operations to 0
        initialize operations_sequence to an empty string
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            calculate L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            calculate R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            if L_diff > 0:
                append "L+" * L_diff to operations_sequence
            else if L_diff < 0:
                append "L-" * abs(L_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            if R_diff > 0:
                append "R+" * R_diff to operations_sequence
            else if R_diff < 0:
                append "R-" * abs(R_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            update total_operations by adding abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case

   - Check that the total number of operations is correctly calculated and reset for each test case.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        total_operations = 0
        operations_sequence = []
        
        # Iterate over each pair of consecutive segments
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the difference in L and R
            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            # Adjust L first for lexicographical order
            if L_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L+" * L_diff)
            elif L_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L-" * (-L_diff))
            
            # Adjust R
            if R_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R+" * R_diff)
            elif R_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R-" * (-R_diff))
            
            # Update the total number of operations
            total_operations += abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    # Output all results
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    segments = []
    for _ in range(N):
        L, R = int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2])
        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append((N, segments))

transform_segments(T, test_cases)
```

This code should correctly handle the transformation of segments by ensuring that operations are applied in the correct order and that the sequence of operations is reset for each test case.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input

    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:

-1 0
0 1

1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

Chef has a series of segments, each defined by two integers [L, R]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by sequentially transforming each segment into the next one. The transformation involves shifting the borders of the segment by one unit at a time, either increasing or decreasing L or R. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to achieve this transformation and to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

To solve this problem, we need to transform each segment into the next one in the sequence. For each transformation from segment [Li, Ri] to [Li+1, Ri+1], we need to:
- Adjust Li to Li+1 using the minimal number of operations.
- Adjust Ri to Ri+1 using the minimal number of operations.

For each segment transformation:
- If Li < Li+1, perform (Li+1 - Li) "L+" operations.
- If Li > Li+1, perform (Li - Li+1) "L-" operations.
- If Ri < Ri+1, perform (Ri+1 - Ri) "R+" operations.
- If Ri > Ri+1, perform (Ri - Ri+1) "R-" operations.

We repeat this process for each pair of consecutive segments and concatenate the operations to form the final sequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments as a list of pairs (Li, Ri)
        
        initialize total_operations to 0
        initialize operations_sequence to an empty string
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            calculate L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            calculate R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            if L_diff > 0:
                append "L+" * L_diff to operations_sequence
            else if L_diff < 0:
                append "L-" * abs(L_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            if R_diff > 0:
                append "R+" * R_diff to operations_sequence
            else if R_diff < 0:
                append "R-" * abs(R_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            update total_operations by adding abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform each segment [Li, Ri] into the next segment [Li+1, Ri+1] using the minimal number of operations.
   - The operations are: "L+" (increment L), "L-" (decrement L), "R+" (increment R), "R-" (decrement R).
   - The sequence of operations should be lexicographically minimal if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over each pair of consecutive segments and calculates the difference in L and R.
   - It then appends the required operations to a list and counts the total number of operations.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The solution might not be correctly handling the lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be ordered as "L+", "L-", "R+", "R-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.
   - The solution might not be correctly resetting or initializing variables for each test case, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Correct the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the operations are appended in the correct lexicographical order.
   - Verify that the operations sequence is correctly reset for each test case.
   - Check that the total number of operations is correctly calculated and reset for each test case.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        total_operations = 0
        operations_sequence = []
        
        # Iterate over each pair of consecutive segments
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the difference in L and R
            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            # Adjust L first for lexicographical order
            if L_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L+" * L_diff)
            elif L_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L-" * (-L_diff))
            
            # Adjust R
            if R_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R+" * R_diff)
            elif R_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R-" * (-R_diff))
            
            # Update the total number of operations
            total_operations += abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    # Output all results
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1
1 2

Output:

R+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+
0

R+
13
L-R-L-L-L-L-R-R-R-R-L+R+L+

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

Chef has a series of segments, each defined by two integers [L, R]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by sequentially transforming each segment into the next one. The transformation involves shifting the borders of the segment by one unit at a time, either increasing or decreasing L or R. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to achieve this transformation and to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

To solve this problem, we need to transform each segment into the next one in the sequence. For each transformation from segment [Li, Ri] to [Li+1, Ri+1], we need to:
- Adjust Li to Li+1 using the minimal number of operations.
- Adjust Ri to Ri+1 using the minimal number of operations.

For each segment transformation:
- If Li < Li+1, perform (Li+1 - Li) "L+" operations.
- If Li > Li+1, perform (Li - Li+1) "L-" operations.
- If Ri < Ri+1, perform (Ri+1 - Ri) "R+" operations.
- If Ri > Ri+1, perform (Ri - Ri+1) "R-" operations.

We repeat this process for each pair of consecutive segments and concatenate the operations to form the final sequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments as a list of pairs (Li, Ri)
        
        initialize total_operations to 0
        initialize operations_sequence to an empty string
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            calculate L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            calculate R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            if L_diff > 0:
                append "L+" * L_diff to operations_sequence
            else if L_diff < 0:
                append "L-" * abs(L_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            if R_diff > 0:
                append "R+" * R_diff to operations_sequence
            else if R_diff < 0:
                append "R-" * abs(R_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            update total_operations by adding abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        total_operations = 0
        operations_sequence = []
        
        # Iterate over each pair of consecutive segments
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the difference in L and R
            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]

            if L_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L+" * L_diff)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform each segment [Li, Ri] into the next segment [Li+1, Ri+1] using the minimal number of operations.
   - The operations are: "L+" (increment L), "L-" (decrement L), "R+" (increment R), "R-" (decrement R).
   - The sequence of operations should be lexicographically minimal if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over each pair of consecutive segments and calculates the difference in L and R.
   - It then appends the required operations to a list and counts the total number of operations.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The solution might not be correctly handling the lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be ordered as "L+", "L-", "R+", "R-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.
   - The solution might not be correctly resetting or initializing variables for each test case, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Correct the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the operations are appended in the correct lexicographical order.
   - Verify that the operations sequence is correctly reset for each test case.
   - Check that the total number of operations is correctly calculated and reset for each test case.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case

            next_segment = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the difference in L and R
            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            # Adjust L first for lexicographical order
            if L_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L+" * L_diff)
            elif L_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L-" * (-L_diff))
            
            # Adjust R
            if R_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R+" * R_diff)
            elif R_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R-" * (-R_diff))
            
            # Update the total number of operations
            total_operations += abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    # Output all results
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform each segment [Li, Ri] into the next segment [Li+1, Ri+1] using the minimal number of operations.
   - The operations are: "L+" (increment L), "L-" (decrement L), "R+" (increment R), "R-" (decrement R).
   - The sequence of operations should be lexicographically minimal if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over each pair of consecutive segments and calculates the difference in L and R.
   - It then appends the required operations to a list and counts the total number of operations.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The solution might not be correctly handling the lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be ordered as "L+", "L-", "R+", "R-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.
   - The solution might not be correctly resetting or initializing variables for each test case, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Correct the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the operations are appended in the correct lexicographical order.
   - Verify that the operations sequence is correctly reset for each test case.
   - Check that the total number of operations is correctly calculated and reset for each test case.

5. **Specific Issue:**
   - The operations are not being appended in the correct lexicographical order. The order should be "R+", "L+", "R-", "L-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        total_operations = 0

            next_segment = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the difference in L and R
            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            # Adjust R first for lexicographical order
            if R_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R+" * R_diff)
            elif R_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R-" * (-R_diff))
            
            # Adjust L
            if L_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L+" * L_diff)
            elif L_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L-" * (-L_diff))
            
            # Update the total number of operations
            total_operations += abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    # Output all results
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

        L, R = int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2])
        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append((N, segments))

transform_segments(T, test_cases)

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4

-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1

Output:

R+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+
0

13
L-R-L-L-L-L-R-R-R-R-L+R+L+

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

Chef has a series of segments, each defined by two integers [L, R]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by sequentially transforming each segment into the next one. The transformation involves shifting the borders of the segment by one unit at a time, either increasing or decreasing L or R. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to achieve this transformation and to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

To solve this problem, we need to transform each segment into the next one in the sequence. For each transformation from segment [Li, Ri] to [Li+1, Ri+1], we need to:
- Adjust Li to Li+1 using the minimal number of operations.
- Adjust Ri to Ri+1 using the minimal number of operations.

For each segment transformation:
- If Li < Li+1, perform (Li+1 - Li) "L+" operations.
- If Li > Li+1, perform (Li - Li+1) "L-" operations.
- If Ri < Ri+1, perform (Ri+1 - Ri) "R+" operations.
- If Ri > Ri+1, perform (Ri - Ri+1) "R-" operations.

We repeat this process for each pair of consecutive segments and concatenate the operations to form the final sequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments as a list of pairs (Li, Ri)
        
        initialize total_operations to 0
        initialize operations_sequence to an empty string
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            calculate L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            calculate R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            if L_diff > 0:
                append "L+" * L_diff to operations_sequence
            else if L_diff < 0:
                append "L-" * abs(L_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            if R_diff > 0:
                append "R+" * R_diff to operations_sequence
            else if R_diff < 0:
                append "R-" * abs(R_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            update total_operations by adding abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        total_operations = 0
        operations_sequence = []
        
        # Iterate over each pair of consecutive segments
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the difference in L and R
            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform each segment [Li, Ri] into the next segment [Li+1, Ri+1] using the minimal number of operations.
   - The operations are: "L+" (increment L), "L-" (decrement L), "R+" (increment R), "R-" (decrement R).
   - The sequence of operations should be lexicographically minimal if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over each pair of consecutive segments and calculates the difference in L and R.
   - It then appends the required operations to a list and counts the total number of operations.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The solution might not be correctly handling the lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be ordered as "L+", "L-", "R+", "R-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.
   - The solution might not be correctly resetting or initializing variables for each test case, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Correct the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the operations are appended in the correct lexicographical order.
   - Verify that the operations sequence is correctly reset for each test case.
   - Check that the total number of operations is correctly calculated and reset for each test case.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        total_operations = 0

        # Iterate over each pair of consecutive segments
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the difference in L and R
            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            # Adjust L first for lexicographical order
            if L_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L+" * L_diff)
            elif L_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L-" * (-L_diff))
            
            # Adjust R
            if R_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R+" * R_diff)
            elif R_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R-" * (-R_diff))
            
            # Update the total number of operations
            total_operations += abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    # Output all results
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):

        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append((N, segments))

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform each segment [Li, Ri] into the next segment [Li+1, Ri+1] using the minimal number of operations.
   - The operations are: "L+" (increment L), "L-" (decrement L), "R+" (increment R), "R-" (decrement R).
   - The sequence of operations should be lexicographically minimal if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over each pair of consecutive segments and calculates the difference in L and R.
   - It then appends the required operations to a list and counts the total number of operations.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The solution might not be correctly handling the lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be ordered as "L+", "L-", "R+", "R-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.
   - The solution might not be correctly resetting or initializing variables for each test case, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Correct the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the operations are appended in the correct lexicographical order.
   - Verify that the operations sequence is correctly reset for each test case.
   - Check that the total number of operations is correctly calculated and reset for each test case.

5. **Specific Issue:**
   - The operations are not being appended in the correct lexicographical order. The order should be "R+", "L+", "R-", "L-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python

            L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            # Adjust R first for lexicographical order
            if R_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R+" * R_diff)
            elif R_diff < 0:
                operations_sequence.append("R-" * (-R_diff))
            
            # Adjust L
            if L_diff > 0:

            # Update the total number of operations
            total_operations += abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    # Output all results

    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] In tackling the problem of transforming segments with minimal operations, the core concept was to ensure that the sequence of operations is both minimal in number and lexicographically smallest. The operations allowed were "L+", "L-", "R+", and "R-", and the challenge was to apply these in the correct order to achieve the desired transformation.

Initially, the solution focused on calculating the differences between consecutive segments and applying operations based on these differences. However, the key mistake was not ensuring the correct lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be applied in the order of "R+", "L+", "R-", "L-" to ensure the sequence is lexicographically minimal.

The main learning point was the importance of operation order in achieving the correct lexicographical sequence. The solution was adjusted to prioritize "R+" and "L+" before "R-" and "L-", which resolved the issue. Additionally, ensuring that the operations sequence is reset for each test case was crucial to avoid carry-over errors between test cases.

This experience highlighted the importance of understanding both the numerical and lexicographical requirements of a problem and ensuring that both are addressed in the solution.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4

-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

Chef has a series of segments, each defined by two integers [L, R]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by sequentially transforming each segment into the next one. The transformation involves shifting the borders of the segment by one unit at a time, either increasing or decreasing L or R. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to achieve this transformation and to provide the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

To solve this problem, we need to transform each segment into the next one in the sequence. For each transformation from segment [Li, Ri] to [Li+1, Ri+1], we need to:
- Adjust Li to Li+1 using the minimal number of operations.
- Adjust Ri to Ri+1 using the minimal number of operations.

For each segment transformation:
- If Li < Li+1, perform (Li+1 - Li) "L+" operations.
- If Li > Li+1, perform (Li - Li+1) "L-" operations.
- If Ri < Ri+1, perform (Ri+1 - Ri) "R+" operations.
- If Ri > Ri+1, perform (Ri - Ri+1) "R-" operations.

We repeat this process for each pair of consecutive segments and concatenate the operations to form the final sequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments as a list of pairs (Li, Ri)
        
        initialize total_operations to 0

            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            calculate L_diff = next_segment[0] - current_segment[0]
            calculate R_diff = next_segment[1] - current_segment[1]
            
            if L_diff > 0:
                append "L+" * L_diff to operations_sequence
            else if L_diff < 0:
                append "L-" * abs(L_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            if R_diff > 0:
                append "R+" * R_diff to operations_sequence
            else if R_diff < 0:
                append "R-" * abs(R_diff) to operations_sequence
            
            update total_operations by adding abs(L_diff) + abs(R_diff)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform each segment [Li, Ri] into the next segment [Li+1, Ri+1] using the minimal number of operations.
   - The operations are: "L+" (increment L), "L-" (decrement L), "R+" (increment R), "R-" (decrement R).
   - The sequence of operations should be lexicographically minimal if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The solution iterates over each pair of consecutive segments and calculates the difference in L and R.
   - It then appends the required operations to a list and counts the total number of operations.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The solution might not be correctly handling the lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be ordered as "L+", "L-", "R+", "R-" to ensure lexicographical minimality.
   - The solution might not be correctly resetting or initializing variables for each test case, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Correct the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the operations are appended in the correct lexicographical order.
   - Verify that the operations sequence is correctly reset for each test case.
   - Check that the total number of operations is correctly calculated and reset for each test case.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind:

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []

            # Calculate the difference in L and R

            # Adjust L first for lexicographical order
            if L_diff > 0:
                operations_sequence.append("L+" * L_diff)

This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for tc in range(int(input())):
 N = int(input())
 a, b = list(map(int, input().split()))
 pr = []

 # 'L' is lexicographically lower than 'R'.
 # so, we should first try to apply L+ or L-
 # if we can't then only we'll try to apply R+ or R-

 for i in range(N - 1):
  l, r = list(map(int, input().split()))

  #continue the following process until a == l and b == r
  while a != l or b != r:
   # trying to apply L-
   if a > l:
    a -= 1
    pr.append('L-')

   # now, trying to apply L+ (if a < b)
   elif a + 1 < b and a < l:
    a += 1
    pr.append('L+')

   # ok, so far, so good... now, let's try to apply R+
   elif b < r:
    b += 1
    pr.append('R+')

   # finally, lastly, trying to apply R- (if a < b)
   elif b - 1 > a and b > r:
    b -= 1
    pr.append('R-')

 print(len(pr))
 print(''.join(pr))

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - The official solution emphasizes the importance of lexicographical order by prioritizing "L+" and "L-" operations before "R+" and "R-". This ensures that the sequence of operations is not only minimal in number but also lexicographically smallest. My initial attempts did not correctly prioritize these operations, leading to incorrect outputs.

2. **Iterative Adjustment:**
   - The official solution uses a while loop to iteratively adjust the segment borders until they match the target segment. This approach is more flexible and ensures that each operation is applied in the correct order based on the current state of the segment. My approach attempted to calculate the differences and apply operations in bulk, which did not account for the need to maintain a valid segment throughout the transformation.

3. **Handling Constraints:**
   - The official solution carefully checks conditions like `a + 1 < b` and `b - 1 > a` to ensure that operations do not result in an invalid (empty) segment. This is crucial for maintaining valid segments throughout the transformation process.

4. **Learning from Mistakes:**
   - My initial solutions failed to pass the test cases because they did not correctly handle the order of operations and did not ensure the segment remained valid after each operation. The official solution's step-by-step approach and careful condition checks provide a robust method for solving the problem.

In future problem-solving scenarios, it is important to:
- Pay close attention to the order of operations, especially when lexicographical order is a requirement.
- Consider iterative approaches that adjust the state step-by-step, rather than attempting to apply changes in bulk.
- Ensure that all constraints are respected throughout the process to maintain valid states.
INFO - Updated entry: In tackling the problem of transforming segments with minimal operations, the core concept was to ensure that the sequence of operations is both minimal in number and lexicographically smallest. The operations allowed were "L+", "L-", "R+", and "R-", and the challenge was to apply these in the co...,

INFO - Updated entry: Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - The official solution emphasizes the importance of lexicographical order by prioritizing "L+" and "L-" operations before "R+" and "R-". This ensures that the sequen...,
