He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform\n\nthe first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.\n\nChef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).\n\nChef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. \n\nThe following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations\n\nwithout any whitespaces.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T, N \u2264 1000.\n- -1000 \u2264 Li < Ri \u2264 1000.\nThe total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n4\n3\n-1 0\n0 1\n3 5\n1\n0 1\n3\n-2 -1\n-2 -1\n-2 0\n4\n4 6\n3 5\n-1 1\n1 2\n\nOutput:\n9\nR+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+\n0\n\n1\nR+\n13\nL-R-L-L-L-L-R-R-R-R-L+R+L+\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nChef has a sequence of segments, each defined by two integers [Li, Ri]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by performing a series of operations on the segments in sequence. The operations allowed are shifting the left or right border of a segment by one unit, either increasing or decreasing it. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Operations**: \n   - You can increase or decrease the left or right border of a segment.\n   - You cannot make a segment empty (i.e., L should never equal R).\n\n2. **Transformation Process**:\n   - For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment.\n   - Calculate the difference in the left and right borders between the current and next segment.\n   - Use the minimal number of operations to adjust the borders to match the next segment.\n\n3. **Lexicographical Order**:\n   - When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest one. The order of operations is: L+, L-, R+, R-.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Test Cases**:\n   - For each test case, read the number of segments and the segments themselves.\n   - For each segment, compute the operations needed to transform it into the next segment.\n   - Accumulate the operations and count them.\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - For each test case, output the total number of operations and the sequence of operations.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction transform_segments(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N\n        read segments\n        operations = []\n        for i from 0 to N-2:\n            current_segment = segments[i]\n            next_segment = segments[i+1]\n            while current_segment != next_segment:\n                if current_segment.L < next_segment.L:\n                    operations.append(\"L+\")\n                    current_segment.L += 1\n                elif current_segment.L > next_segment.L:\n                    operations.append(\"L-\")\n                    current_segment.L -= 1\n                elif current_segment.R < next_segment.R:\n                    operations.append(\"R+\")\n                    current_segment.R += 1\n                elif current_segment.R > next_segment.R:\n                    operations.append(\"R-\")\n                    current_segment.R -= 1\n        print number of operations\n        print operations as a string\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef transform_segments(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, segments = test_case\n        operations = []\n        \n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            current_L, current_R = segments[i]\n            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]\n            \n            # Transform current segment to the next segment\n            while current_L != next_L or current_R != next_R:\n                if current_L < next_L:\n                    operations.append(\"L+\")\n                    current_L += 1\n                elif current_L > next_L:\n                    operations.append(\"L-\")\n                    current_L -= 1\n                elif current_R < next_R:\n                    operations.append(\"R+\")\n                    current_R += 1\n                elif current_R > next_R:\n                    operations.append(\"R-\")\n                    current_R -= 1\n        \n        results.append((len(operations), ''.join(operations)))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result[0])\n        print(result[1])\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 4\n# test_cases = [\n#     (3, [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (3, 5)]),\n#     (1, [(0, 1)]),\n#     (3, [(-2, -1), (-2, -1), (-2, 0)]),\n#     (4, [(4, 6), (3, 5), (-1, 1), (1, 2)])\n# ]\n# transform_segments(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis code reads the number of test cases and segments, then iteratively transforms each segment to the next one using the minimal number of operations, while ensuring the operations are lexicographically minimal.

The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.\n\n    #### Key Insights and Strategies\n\n    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.\n\n    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N = test_case[0]\n            A = test_case[1]\n        \n            current_sum = 0\n            possible = True\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                current_sum += A[i]\n                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n        \n            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N = test_case[0]\n            A = test_case[1]\n        \n            current_sum = 0\n            possible = True\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                current_sum += A[i]\n                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n        \n            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The operations allowed were \"L+\", \"L-\", \"R+\", and \"R-\", and the challenge was to apply these in the correct order to achieve the desired transformation.\n\nInitially, the solution focused on calculating the differences between consecutive segments and applying operations based on these differences. However, the key mistake was not ensuring the correct lexicographical order of operations. The operations should be applied in the order of \"R+\", \"L+\", \"R-\", \"L-\" to ensure the sequence is lexicographically minimal.\n\nThe main learning point was the importance of operation order in achieving the correct lexicographical sequence.

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Lexicographical Order:**\n   - The official solution emphasizes the importance of lexicographical order by prioritizing \"L+\" and \"L-\" operations before \"R+\" and \"R-\". This ensures that the sequence of operations is not only minimal in number but also lexicographically smallest. My initial attempts did not correctly prioritize these operations, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n2. **Iterative Adjustment:**\n   - The official solution uses a while loop to iteratively adjust the segment borders until they match the target segment. This approach is more flexible and ensures that each operation is applied in the correct order based on the current state of the segment. My approach attempted to calculate the differences and apply operations in bulk, which did not account for the need to maintain a valid segment throughout the transformation.\n\n3. **Handling Constraints:**\n   - The official solution carefully checks conditions like `a + 1 < b` and `b - 1 > a` to ensure that operations do not result in an invalid (empty) segment. This is crucial for maintaining valid segments throughout the transformation process.\n\n4. **Learning from Mistakes:**\n   - My initial solutions failed to pass the test cases because they did not correctly handle the order of operations and did not ensure the segment remained valid after each operation. The official solution's step-by-step approach and careful condition checks provide a robust method for solving the problem.\n\nIn future problem-solving scenarios, it is important to:\n- Pay close attention to the order of operations, especially when lexicographical order is a requirement.\n- Consider iterative approaches that adjust the state step-by-step, rather than attempting to apply changes in bulk.\n- Ensure that all constraints are respected throughout the process to maintain valid states."
