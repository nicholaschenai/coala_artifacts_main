    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was efficiently managing a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king visits to behead the richest citizen who has appeared so far. The challenge was to quickly identify and remove the richest citizen who is still alive at each king's visit.\n\nThe key strategy was to use a max-heap to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they appear. By negating the wealth values, we could simulate a max-heap using Python's list sorting. This allowed us to efficiently extract the richest citizen when the king visits. Additionally, a set was used to track which citizens had already been beheaded, ensuring that only living citizens were considered during each visit.\n\nOne potential pitfall was ensuring that the heap operations were efficient, especially given the constraints with large numbers of citizens and visits. The solution involved careful management of the heap and the beheaded set to maintain performance. This approach worked well, and the solution passed all test cases without any unexpected errors.",
    "reflection": "The problem was straightforward, and my initial approach using a max-heap was efficient for handling the task of finding the richest citizen quickly. However, the official solution takes a simpler approach by using a list to store the wealth of citizens and iterating through it to find the richest citizen when the king visits. This approach is less efficient in terms of time complexity, as it involves scanning the list for each king's visit, resulting in a time complexity of O(N * M) in the worst case.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n- The official solution uses a simple list to store the wealth and iterates through it to find the maximum wealth when needed. This is straightforward but not optimal for large inputs.\n- The solution marks a citizen as beheaded by setting their wealth to `-1` in the list, which is a simple way to track who has been beheaded.\n\nIn contrast, my approach with a max-heap is more efficient for large inputs, as it allows for O(log N) operations to insert and extract the maximum wealth. This is particularly beneficial given the constraints where N and M can be quite large.\n\nIn future problems where efficiency is crucial, especially with large input sizes, using data structures like heaps can provide significant performance improvements over simpler iterative approaches.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: process_events]\nThis function reads a series of events from standard input, where the first line contains two integers, N and M, and subsequent lines represent events. It uses a max-heap to manage the wealth of citizens, where positive integers indicate the wealth of a new citizen to be added to the heap. When a -1 event occurs, it simulates a king's visit by finding and printing the wealth of the richest citizen who has not been beheaded, removing them from the heap and marking them as beheaded. The function ensures that only citizens who are not already beheaded are considered during a king's visit by checking against a set of beheaded citizens. The heap operations are managed by helper functions that handle the insertion and removal of elements while maintaining the max-heap property.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to efficiently manage and query a dynamic set of data to find the maximum or minimum value, especially when elements can be removed or marked as inactive. This is common in priority queue implementations, scheduling tasks based on priority, or any system where you need to frequently access the highest priority item. The use of a max-heap (or min-heap) is a classic approach to handle such problems efficiently, allowing for quick insertion and removal of elements while maintaining the ability to access the maximum (or minimum) element in constant time. This is particularly relevant in competitive programming, real-time systems, and resource management applications."
