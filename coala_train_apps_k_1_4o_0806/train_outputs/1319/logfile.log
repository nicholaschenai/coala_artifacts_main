## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king visits the court. Each citizen's wealth is a unique positive integer, and a king's visit is denoted by `-1`. When the king visits, the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive is beheaded. We need to determine the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at each of the king's visits.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Data Structure Choice**: Use a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen who is still alive. A max-heap allows us to quickly retrieve and remove the largest element.

2. **Processing Events**:
   - For each citizen's wealth declaration, add the wealth to the max-heap.
   - For each king's visit (`-1`), remove the richest citizen from the heap and record their wealth as they are beheaded.

3. **Output**: For each king's visit, output the wealth of the beheaded citizen.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty max-heap.
2. For each event in the sequence:
   - If the event is a positive integer (citizen's wealth), add it to the max-heap.
   - If the event is `-1` (king's visit):
     - Remove the maximum element from the heap (the richest citizen still alive).
     - Record this wealth as the beheaded citizen's wealth.
3. Print the recorded wealths for each king's visit.

## Python Solution

```python
import sys
import heapq

def process_events():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = int(data[1])
    
    events = data[2:]
    
    # Max-heap to store the wealth of citizens
    max_heap = []
    
    # List to store the results of each king's visit
    results = []
    
    for event in events:
        if event == '-1':
            # King visits, pop the richest citizen
            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            results.append(richest)
        else:
            # Citizen declares wealth, add to heap
            wealth = int(event)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)
    
    # Output the results for each king's visit
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a max-heap to keep track of the richest citizens. Python's `heapq` module provides a min-heap, so we store negative values to simulate a max-heap.
- We read all input data at once and split it into a list of strings.
- We iterate over each event:
  - If it's a positive integer, we convert it to a negative and push it onto the heap.
  - If it's `-1`, we pop the largest (most negative) value from the heap, convert it back to positive, and record it as the wealth of the beheaded citizen.
- Finally, we print the wealth of the beheaded citizen for each king's visit.

Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead achieved by either player at any point during the game. The solution involved reading multiple rounds of scores, calculating cumulative scores, and tracking the maximum lead and the player who achieved it.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Cumulative Scores:** Continuously updating the scores for each player after every round.
    - **Lead Calculation:** Determining the lead by calculating the absolute difference between the cumulative scores of the two players.
    - **Tracking Maximum Lead:** Keeping track of the maximum lead encountered and the player who had this lead.

    ### Strategies and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling:** Initially, the function was not called, which led to no output. The fix was to ensure the function is called after its definition to process the input and generate the output.
    - **Standard Input/Output:** Using `sys.stdin.read()` to handle input and `print()` for output was effective for competitive programming environments.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_winner_and_lead():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        N = int(data[0])
        player1_cumulative_score = 0
        player2_cumulative_score = 0
        max_lead = 0
        winner = 0
    
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            Si, Ti = map(int, data[i].split())
            player1_cumulative_score += Si
            player2_cumulative_score += Ti
            current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
        
            if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
                current_leader = 1
            else:
                current_leader = 2
        
            if current_lead > max_lead:
                max_lead = current_lead
                winner = current_leader
    
        print(winner, max_lead)

    find_winner_and_lead()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are executed in scripts that rely on standard input/output, especially in competitive programming contexts.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king visits the court. Each citizen's wealth is a unique positive integer, and a king's visit is denoted by `-1`. When the king visits, the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive is beheaded. We need to output the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at each of the king's visits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   We will maintain a list of citizens' wealth as they appear. When a king's visit occurs, we need to find the richest citizen who is still alive (i.e., not yet beheaded). We can use a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen. Each time a citizen appears, we add their wealth to the heap. When the king visits, we extract the maximum wealth from the heap, which represents the richest citizen to be beheaded.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize an empty max-heap
   Initialize an empty set to track beheaded citizens

   For each event in the sequence:
       If the event is a positive integer (citizen's wealth):
           Add the wealth to the max-heap
       Else if the event is -1 (king's visit):
           While the top of the heap is in the set of beheaded citizens:
               Remove the top of the heap
           Extract the maximum wealth from the heap
           Add this wealth to the set of beheaded citizens
           Output this wealth

    # Initialize a max-heap and a set to track beheaded citizens
    max_heap = []
    beheaded = set()

        heap.sort()
    
    # Function to pop from max-heap (negate value back)

        event = int(event)

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king visits the court. Each citizen's wealth is a unique positive integer, and a king's visit is denoted by `-1`. When the king visits, the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive is beheaded. We need to output the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at each of the king's visits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   We will maintain a list of citizens' wealth as they appear. When a king's visit occurs, we need to find the richest citizen who is still alive (i.e., not yet beheaded). We can use a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen. Each time a citizen appears, we add their wealth to the heap. When the king visits, we extract the maximum wealth from the heap, which represents the richest citizen to be beheaded.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize an empty max-heap
   Initialize an empty set to track beheaded citizens

   For each event in the sequence:
       If the event is a positive integer (citizen's wealth):
           Add the wealth to the max-heap
       Else if the event is -1 (king's visit):
           While the top of the heap is in the set of beheaded citizens:
               Remove the top of the heap
           Extract the maximum wealth from the heap
           Add this wealth to the set of beheaded citizens
           Output this wealth
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def process_events():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    # Read the first line to get N and M
    N, M = map(int, data[0].split())
    
    # Initialize a max-heap and a set to track beheaded citizens
    max_heap = []
    beheaded = set()
    
    # Function to push into max-heap (negate value for max-heap behavior)
    def push_heap(heap, value):
        heap.append(-value)
        heap.sort()
    
    # Function to pop from max-heap (negate value back)
    def pop_heap(heap):
        return -heap.pop(0)
    
    # Process each event
    for event in data[1:]:
        event = int(event)
        if event > 0:
            # Citizen's wealth, add to heap
            push_heap(max_heap, event)
        elif event == -1:
            # King's visit, find the richest alive
            while max_heap and -max_heap[0] in beheaded:
                pop_heap(max_heap)
            richest = pop_heap(max_heap)
            beheaded.add(richest)
            print(richest)

process_events()
```

This solution uses a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen who is still alive. The heap operations are managed by negating values to simulate max-heap behavior using Python's list sorting.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was efficiently managing a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king visits to behead the richest citizen who has appeared so far. The challenge was to quickly identify and remove the richest citizen who is still alive at each king's visit.

The key strategy was to use a max-heap to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they appear. By negating the wealth values, we could simulate a max-heap using Python's list sorting. This allowed us to efficiently extract the richest citizen when the king visits. Additionally, a set was used to track which citizens had already been beheaded, ensuring that only living citizens were considered during each visit.

One potential pitfall was ensuring that the heap operations were efficient, especially given the constraints with large numbers of citizens and visits. The solution involved careful management of the heap and the beheaded set to maintain performance. This approach worked well, and the solution passed all test cases without any unexpected errors.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my initial approach using a max-heap was efficient for handling the task of finding the richest citizen quickly. However, the official solution takes a simpler approach by using a list to store the wealth of citizens and iterating through it to find the richest citizen when the king visits. This approach is less efficient in terms of time complexity, as it involves scanning the list for each king's visit, resulting in a time complexity of O(N * M) in the worst case.

Key insights from the official solution:
- The official solution uses a simple list to store the wealth and iterates through it to find the maximum wealth when needed. This is straightforward but not optimal for large inputs.
- The solution marks a citizen as beheaded by setting their wealth to `-1` in the list, which is a simple way to track who has been beheaded.

In contrast, my approach with a max-heap is more efficient for large inputs, as it allows for O(log N) operations to insert and extract the maximum wealth. This is particularly beneficial given the constraints where N and M can be quite large.

In future problems where efficiency is crucial, especially with large input sizes, using data structures like heaps can provide significant performance improvements over simpler iterative approaches.

    Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
    The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

    -----Output:-----
    Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
    - $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
    - You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.
