He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.\nThe wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.\nThe king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family \u2026) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.\nSuppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is\n1376518911241376518911241\\; 3\\; 7\\; 6\\; 5\\; 18\\;  9\\; 11\\;  2\\; 4\nand the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.\nAt the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.\nYou may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.\nYour aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.\nThe next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nYour output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 10000$.\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$.\n- You may assume that in $50 \\%$ of the inputs $1 \\leq M \\leq 1000$ and $1 \\leq N \\leq 8000$.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n10 3\n1 \n3 \n7 \n6 \n-1 \n5 \n-1 \n18 \n9 \n11\n2\n-1\n4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n7\n6\n18\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each citizen's wealth is a unique positive integer, and a king's visit is denoted by `-1`. When the king visits, the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive is beheaded. We need to determine the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at each of the king's visits.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Data Structure Choice**: Use a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen who is still alive. A max-heap allows us to quickly retrieve and remove the largest element.\n\n2. **Processing Events**:\n   - For each citizen's wealth declaration, add the wealth to the max-heap.\n   - For each king's visit (`-1`), remove the richest citizen from the heap and record their wealth as they are beheaded.\n\n3. **Output**: For each king's visit, output the wealth of the beheaded citizen.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize an empty max-heap.\n2. For each event in the sequence:\n   - If the event is a positive integer (citizen's wealth), add it to the max-heap.\n   - If the event is `-1` (king's visit):\n     - Remove the maximum element from the heap (the richest citizen still alive).\n     - Record this wealth as the beheaded citizen's wealth.\n3. Print the recorded wealths for each king's visit.\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef process_events():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    M = int(data[1])\n    \n    events = data[2:]\n    \n    # Max-heap to store the wealth of citizens\n    max_heap = []\n    \n    # List to store the results of each king's visit\n    results = []\n    \n    for event in events:\n        if event == '-1':\n            # King visits, pop the richest citizen\n            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)\n            results.append(richest)\n        else:\n            # Citizen declares wealth, add to heap\n            wealth = int(event)\n            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)\n    \n    # Output the results for each king's visit\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We use a max-heap to keep track of the richest citizens. Python's `heapq` module provides a min-heap, so we store negative values to simulate a max-heap.\n- We read all input data at once and split it into a list of strings.\n- We iterate over each event:\n  - If it's a positive integer, we convert it to a negative and push it onto the heap.\n  - If it's `-1`, we pop the largest (most negative) value from the heap, convert it back to positive, and record it as the wealth of the beheaded citizen.\n- Finally, we print the wealth of the beheaded citizen for each king's visit."

The solution involved reading multiple rounds of scores, calculating cumulative scores, and tracking the maximum lead and the player who achieved it.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Cumulative Scores:** Continuously updating the scores for each player after every round.\n    - **Lead Calculation:** Determining the lead by calculating the absolute difference between the cumulative scores of the two players.\n    - **Tracking Maximum Lead:** Keeping track of the maximum lead encountered and the player who had this lead.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling:** Initially, the function was not called, which led to no output. The fix was to ensure the function is called after its definition to process the input and generate the output.\n    - **Standard Input/Output:** Using `sys.stdin.read()` to handle input and `print()` for output was effective for competitive programming environments.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_winner_and_lead():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        N = int(data[0])\n        player1_cumulative_score = 0\n        player2_cumulative_score = 0\n        max_lead = 0\n        winner = 0\n    \n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            Si, Ti = map(int, data[i].split())\n            player1_cumulative_score += Si\n            player2_cumulative_score += Ti\n            current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)\n        \n            if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:\n                current_leader = 1\n            else:\n                current_leader = 2\n        \n            if current_lead > max_lead:\n                max_lead = current_lead\n                winner = current_leader\n    \n        print(winner, max_lead)\n\n    find_winner_and_lead()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are executed in scripts that rely on standard input/output, especially in competitive programming contexts.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

However, the official solution takes a simpler approach by using a list to store the wealth of citizens and iterating through it to find the richest citizen when the king visits. This approach is less efficient in terms of time complexity, as it involves scanning the list for each king's visit, resulting in a time complexity of O(N * M) in the worst case.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n- The official solution uses a simple list to store the wealth and iterates through it to find the maximum wealth when needed. This is straightforward but not optimal for large inputs.\n- The solution marks a citizen as beheaded by setting their wealth to `-1` in the list, which is a simple way to track who has been beheaded.\n\nIn contrast, my approach with a max-heap is more efficient for large inputs, as it allows for O(log N) operations to insert and extract the maximum wealth. This is particularly beneficial given the constraints where N and M can be quite large.\n\nIn future problems where efficiency is crucial, especially with large input sizes, using data structures like heaps can provide significant performance improvements over simpler iterative approaches."

When a -1 event occurs, it simulates a king's visit by finding and printing the wealth of the richest citizen who has not been beheaded, removing them from the heap and marking them as beheaded. The function ensures that only citizens who are not already beheaded are considered during a king's visit by checking against a set of beheaded citizens. The heap operations are managed by helper functions that handle the insertion and removal of elements while maintaining the max-heap property.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to efficiently manage and query a dynamic set of data to find the maximum or minimum value, especially when elements can be removed or marked as inactive. This is common in priority queue implementations, scheduling tasks based on priority, or any system where you need to frequently access the highest priority item. The use of a max-heap (or min-heap) is a classic approach to handle such problems efficiently, allowing for quick insertion and removal of elements while maintaining the ability to access the maximum (or minimum) element in constant time.
