Given the coordinates of Kabir and Tara, we need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where the mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The solution should be accurate to within an absolute error of 0.01.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Reflection**: The mirror should be placed such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This means the path from Kabir to the mirror and from the mirror to Tara should be symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\n2. **Geometric Insight**: The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula derived from the symmetry of the triangle formed by Kabir, Tara, and the mirror. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   x_{\\text{mirror}} = \\frac{x_1 \\cdot y_2 + x_2 \\cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}\n   \\]\n   This formula ensures that the distances from Kabir to the mirror and from the mirror to Tara are proportional to their respective y-coordinates.\n\n3. **Iterate for Multiple Test Cases**: Since there can be multiple test cases, we need to repeat the calculation for each pair of coordinates provided.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)\n\nread T  # number of test cases\nfor each test case:\n    read x1, y1\n    read x2, y2\n    mirror_x = calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2)\n    print mirror_x formatted to 2 decimal places\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the derived formula\n    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # number of test cases\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        x1 = int(data[index])\n        y1 = int(data[index + 1])\n        x2 = int(data[index + 2])\n        y2 = int(data[index + 3])\n        index += 4\n        \n        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror\n        mirror_x = calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2)\n        \n        # Store the result formatted to 2 decimal places\n        results.append(f\"{mirror_x:.2f}\")\n    \n    # Print all results, each on a new line\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code reads input for multiple test cases, calculates the x-coordinate of the mirror for each case using the derived formula, and prints the result formatted to two decimal places."

The key challenge was correctly transforming the coordinate system to align the rectangle with the given slope.\n\n    ### Insights from the Official Solution\n\n    1. **Coordinate Transformation**:\n       - The official solution uses a transformation based on trigonometric identities to align the rectangle with the slope M. Specifically, it calculates the cosine and sine of the angle derived from the slope M using the formula:\n         \\[\n         \\text{cos}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}}, \\quad \\text{sin}(\\theta) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}}\n         \\]\n       - This transformation is more direct and avoids the need for calculating the angle explicitly using `atan`.\n\n    2. **Efficiency**:\n       - The solution efficiently computes the transformed coordinates and directly calculates the bounds (min and max) for these coordinates to determine the rectangle's dimensions.\n       - This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, as it processes each point in constant time and uses minimal additional space.\n\n    3. **Perimeter Calculation**:\n       - The perimeter is calculated using the differences between the maximum and minimum transformed coordinates, which directly gives the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways\n\n    - **Trigonometric Transformations**: Using trigonometric identities can simplify the transformation process, especially when dealing with slopes and angles.\n    - **Direct Calculation**: Avoid unnecessary calculations by directly using mathematical properties (like the Pythagorean identity) to derive needed values.\n    - **Precision**: Ensure that calculations maintain precision, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic, to meet problem constraints.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric transformations and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify complex problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
