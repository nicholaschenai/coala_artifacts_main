Kabir wants to see Tara's smile using a mirror placed on the x-axis. Given the coordinates of Kabir and Tara, we need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where the mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The solution should be accurate to within an absolute error of 0.01.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Reflection**: The mirror should be placed such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This means the path from Kabir to the mirror and from the mirror to Tara should be symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

2. **Geometric Insight**: The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula derived from the symmetry of the triangle formed by Kabir, Tara, and the mirror. The formula is:
   \[
   x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that the distances from Kabir to the mirror and from the mirror to Tara are proportional to their respective y-coordinates.

3. **Iterate for Multiple Test Cases**: Since there can be multiple test cases, we need to repeat the calculation for each pair of coordinates provided.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

read T  # number of test cases
for each test case:
    read x1, y1
    read x2, y2
    mirror_x = calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    print mirror_x formatted to 2 decimal places
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the derived formula
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])  # number of test cases
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        x2 = int(data[index + 2])
        y2 = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        
        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror
        mirror_x = calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        
        # Store the result formatted to 2 decimal places
        results.append(f"{mirror_x:.2f}")
    
    # Print all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads input for multiple test cases, calculates the x-coordinate of the mirror for each case using the derived formula, and prints the result formatted to two decimal places.

    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Process

    The problem required finding the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that covers a set of points, with one side having a specific slope. The key challenge was correctly transforming the coordinate system to align the rectangle with the given slope.

    ### Insights from the Official Solution

    1. **Coordinate Transformation**:
       - The official solution uses a transformation based on trigonometric identities to align the rectangle with the slope M. Specifically, it calculates the cosine and sine of the angle derived from the slope M using the formula:
         \[
         \text{cos}(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + M^2}}, \quad \text{sin}(\theta) = \frac{M}{\sqrt{1 + M^2}}
         \]
       - This transformation is more direct and avoids the need for calculating the angle explicitly using `atan`.

    2. **Efficiency**:
       - The solution efficiently computes the transformed coordinates and directly calculates the bounds (min and max) for these coordinates to determine the rectangle's dimensions.
       - This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, as it processes each point in constant time and uses minimal additional space.

    3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
       - The perimeter is calculated using the differences between the maximum and minimum transformed coordinates, which directly gives the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.

    ### Key Takeaways

    - **Trigonometric Transformations**: Using trigonometric identities can simplify the transformation process, especially when dealing with slopes and angles.
    - **Direct Calculation**: Avoid unnecessary calculations by directly using mathematical properties (like the Pythagorean identity) to derive needed values.
    - **Precision**: Ensure that calculations maintain precision, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic, to meet problem constraints.

    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric transformations and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify complex problems.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The core concept here was understanding the geometric property of reflection, where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This led to the derivation of a formula to calculate the mirror's position based on the coordinates of Kabir and Tara.

The formula used was:
\[ x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2} \]
This formula ensures that the path from Kabir to the mirror and from the mirror to Tara forms a straight line, satisfying the reflection condition.

The solution involved reading multiple test cases, applying the formula for each, and printing the result with a precision of two decimal places. The implementation was straightforward, and the main challenge was ensuring the correct application of the formula and handling input/output efficiently.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric properties and translating them into mathematical formulas for computational solutions. The experience was smooth, with no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases successfully.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Kabir wants to see Tara's smile using a mirror placed on the x-axis. Given the coordinates of Kabir and Tara, we need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where the mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The solution should be accurate to two decimal places.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Reflection**: The mirror should be placed such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This means the path from Kabir to the mirror and from the mirror to Tara should form a straight line.

2. **Geometric Insight**: The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula derived from the reflection property:
   \[
   x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that the angles are equal, satisfying the reflection condition.

3. **Iterate for Each Test Case**: For each test case, compute the x-coordinate of the mirror using the formula and print it with a precision of two decimal places.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

read T  // number of test cases
for each test case:
    read x1, y1
    read x2, y2
    mirror_x = calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    print mirror_x formatted to 2 decimal places
```

### Python Code

```python
def calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the reflection formula
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        x2 = int(data[index + 2])
        y2 = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        
        mirror_x = calculate_mirror_position(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        results.append(f"{mirror_x:.2f}")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

main()
```

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution aligned well with the official solution in terms of the approach and the final result. Both solutions aimed to find the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed to reflect Tara's position to Kabir.

### Key Insights:

1. **Reflection Principle**: Both solutions utilized the geometric property of reflection, ensuring that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This was crucial in deriving the formula for the x-coordinate of the mirror.

2. **Formula Derivation**: My solution directly used a derived formula:
   \[
   x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}
   \]
   The official solution, however, approached it by considering the line equation and solving for the x-intercept, which is effectively the same but approached differently.

3. **Precision Handling**: Both solutions ensured that the output was formatted to two decimal places, which was a requirement of the problem.

### Reflection:

The official solution provided an alternative way to think about the problem using line equations, which can be insightful for similar geometric problems. However, the direct formula approach I used is more concise and avoids potential pitfalls with handling slopes and intercepts, especially when dealing with vertical lines. This experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric properties and how they can be applied to solve problems efficiently.
