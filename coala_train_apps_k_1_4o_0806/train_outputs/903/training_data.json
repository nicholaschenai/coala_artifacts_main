    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The core concept here was understanding the geometric property of reflection, where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This led to the derivation of a formula to calculate the mirror's position based on the coordinates of Kabir and Tara.\n\nThe formula used was:\n\\[ x_{\\text{mirror}} = \\frac{x_1 \\cdot y_2 + x_2 \\cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2} \\]\nThis formula ensures that the path from Kabir to the mirror and from the mirror to Tara forms a straight line, satisfying the reflection condition.\n\nThe solution involved reading multiple test cases, applying the formula for each, and printing the result with a precision of two decimal places. The implementation was straightforward, and the main challenge was ensuring the correct application of the formula and handling input/output efficiently.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric properties and translating them into mathematical formulas for computational solutions. The experience was smooth, with no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases successfully.",
    "reflection": "The problem was straightforward, and my solution aligned well with the official solution in terms of the approach and the final result. Both solutions aimed to find the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed to reflect Tara's position to Kabir.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Reflection Principle**: Both solutions utilized the geometric property of reflection, ensuring that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This was crucial in deriving the formula for the x-coordinate of the mirror.\n\n2. **Formula Derivation**: My solution directly used a derived formula:\n   \\[\n   x_{\\text{mirror}} = \\frac{x_1 \\cdot y_2 + x_2 \\cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}\n   \\]\n   The official solution, however, approached it by considering the line equation and solving for the x-intercept, which is effectively the same but approached differently.\n\n3. **Precision Handling**: Both solutions ensured that the output was formatted to two decimal places, which was a requirement of the problem.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution provided an alternative way to think about the problem using line equations, which can be insightful for similar geometric problems. However, the direct formula approach I used is more concise and avoids potential pitfalls with handling slopes and intercepts, especially when dealing with vertical lines. This experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric properties and how they can be applied to solve problems efficiently.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads four integers representing two points. It calculates the x-coordinate of the mirror position using a helper function and stores the result formatted to two decimal places. After processing all test cases, it prints each calculated mirror x-coordinate on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios involving geometric optics, specifically in problems related to reflections and mirrors. It can be applied in designing systems where a reflection is needed to view an object from a specific point, such as in periscopes, certain types of cameras, or even in architectural design where mirrors are used to reflect views. The problem also involves basic algebra and geometry, making it relevant for educational purposes in teaching these subjects. Additionally, it can be useful in computer graphics where reflections need to be calculated for rendering scenes."
