Just a new idea. Now Chef is expanding his business. He wants to make some new restaurants in the big city of Lviv. To make his business competitive he should interest customers. Now he knows how. But don't tell anyone -  it is a secret plan. Chef knows four national Ukrainian dishes - salo, borsch, varenyky and galushky. It is too few, of course, but enough for the beginning. Every day in his restaurant will be a dish of the day among these four ones. And dishes of the consecutive days must be different. To make the scheme more refined the dish of the first day and the dish of the last day must be different too. Now he wants his assistant to make schedule for some period. Chef suspects that there is more than one possible schedule. Hence he wants his assistant to prepare all possible plans so that he can choose the best one among them. He asks you for help. At first tell him how many such schedules exist. Since the answer can be large output it modulo 109 + 7, that is, you need to output the remainder of division of the actual answer by 109 + 7.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains a single integer N denoting the number of days for which the schedule should be made.\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case output a single integer in a separate line, the answer for the corresponding test case.\n\n-----Constraints-----1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 109\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3\n2\n3\n5\n\nOutput:\n12\n24\n240\n\n-----Explanation-----\nCase 1. For N = 2 days we have the following 12 schedules:\nFirst day Second day  salo   borsch    salo   varenyky    salo   galushky    borsch   salo    borsch   varenyky    borsch   galushky    varenyky   salo    varenyky   borsch    varenyky   galushky    galushky   salo    galushky   borsch    galushky   varenyky  \n\nCase 2. For N = 3 we have the following 24 schedules:\nFirst daySecond dayThird day  salo   borsch   varenyky    salo   borsch   galushky    salo   varenyky   borsch    salo   varenyky   galushky    salo   galushky   borsch    salo   galushky   varenyky    borsch   salo   varenyky    borsch   salo   galushky    borsch   varenyky   salo    borsch   varenyky   galushky    borsch   galushky   salo    borsch   galushky   varenyky    varenyky   salo   borsch    varenyky   salo   galushky    varenyky   borsch   salo    varenyky   borsch   galushky    varenyky   galushky   salo    varenyky   galushky   borsch    galushky   salo   borsch    galushky   salo   varenyky    galushky   borsch   salo    galushky   borsch   varenyky    galushky   varenyky   salo    galushky   varenyky   borsch  \n\nCase 3. Don't be afraid. This time we will not provide you with a table of 240 schedules. The only thing we want to mention here is that apart from the previous two cases schedules for other values of N can have equal dishes (and even must have for N > 4). For example the schedule (salo, borsch, salo, borsch) is a correct schedule for N = 4 while the schedule (varenyky, salo, galushky, verynky, salo) is a correct schedule for N = 5.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The schedule must satisfy the following conditions:\n- The dish of the day must be different from the previous day's dish.\n- The dish on the first day must be different from the dish on the last day.\nGiven the number of days \\( N \\), we need to determine how many such valid schedules exist. The result should be given modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each day, we have 4 choices initially. However, from the second day onward, we have only 3 choices because the dish must be different from the previous day. Additionally, the first and last days must have different dishes.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - For \\( N = 2 \\), we can choose any of the 4 dishes for the first day and any of the remaining 3 dishes for the second day, resulting in \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\) schedules.\n   - For \\( N = 3 \\), we can choose any of the 4 dishes for the first day, any of the 3 for the second day, and any of the 3 for the third day, resulting in \\( 4 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 36 \\) schedules. However, we must subtract the cases where the first and last days are the same, which are \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\), resulting in \\( 36 - 12 = 24 \\) valid schedules.\n\n3. **General Formula**:\n   - For \\( N \\geq 3 \\), the number of valid schedules is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \\times 3^{(N-1)} - 3^{(N-2)}\n     \\]\n   - This formula accounts for all possible schedules and subtracts those where the first and last days are the same.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate_schedules(N):\n    MOD = 10^9 + 7\n    if N == 2:\n        return 12\n    else:\n        power1 = 3^(N-1) % MOD\n        power2 = 3^(N-2) % MOD\n        result = (4 * power1 - power2) % MOD\n        return result\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read N\n        print calculate_schedules(N)\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_schedules(N):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    if N == 2:\n        return 12\n    else:\n        # Calculate 3^(N-1) % MOD\n        power1 = pow(3, N-1, MOD)\n        # Calculate 3^(N-2) % MOD\n        power2 = pow(3, N-2, MOD)\n        # Calculate the result using the formula\n        result = (4 * power1 - power2) % MOD\n        return result\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        results.append(calculate_schedules(N))\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the number of valid schedules using the derived formula, taking care to apply the modulo operation to handle large numbers."

The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \\leq i \\leq N$.    \n        A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems.

So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.\n        - \n        Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.\n        - \n        Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution:\n\n        1. **Function Call**: The function `max_contests` is defined but never called. This is why no output is detected. The function needs to be called with the appropriate input.\n\n        2. **Input Handling**: The solution assumes that the input is already parsed into a structured format (`test_cases`), but in a real scenario, the input is typically read from standard input as a string. We need to parse this input correctly.\n\n        3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and then printed, but the function is not called, so this step is never reached.\n\n        To fix these issues, we need to:\n\n        - Read the input from standard input.\n        - Parse the input into the required format.\n        - Call the function with the parsed input.\n        - Ensure the function prints the results directly.\n\n        Let's correct the solution with these considerations:\n\n        ```python\n        def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N, K, D = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                # Calculate the total number of problems available\n                total_problems = sum(A)\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed\n                max_possible_contests = total_problems // K\n        \n                # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D\n                max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)\n        \n                # Store the result for this test case\n                results.append(max_contests)\n    \n            # Print all results for each test case\n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Read input from standard input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        # Parse the input\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        test_cases = []\n\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n            index += 3\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K, D), A))\n\n        # Call the function with the parsed input\n        max_contests(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Changes:\n\n        - **Input Reading**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings.\n        - **Input Parsing**: We parse the number of test cases `T` and then iterate over each test case to extract `N`, `K`, `D`, and the list `A`.\n        - **Function Call**: We call `max_contests` with the parsed input.\n        - **Output**: The function prints the results directly for each test case. \n\n        This should correctly handle the input and output as expected in a competitive programming environment.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's fix the solution by ensuring that the function is called and the input is handled correctly.

If the `main()` function is defined but not called, the script will not perform any operations, leading to no output.\n\n### Steps to Fix the Issue\n\n1. **Ensure Execution of the Main Function**: The `main()` function should be called at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.\n\n2. **Check Input/Output Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly from standard input and that the output is printed to standard output.\n\n### Revised Python Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_schedules(N):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    if N == 2:\n        return (4 * 3) % MOD\n    else:\n        # Using modular exponentiation to compute 3^(N-2) % MOD\n        power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)\n        return (4 * power * 2) % MOD\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        result = calculate_schedules(N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Fix\n\n- **Calling the Main Function**: The script now includes a conditional check `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` to call the `main()` function. This ensures that the function is executed when the script is run, allowing it to read input, process it, and print the output.\n- **Standard Input/Output**: The script reads from standard input and writes to standard output, which is typical for competitive programming and similar environments. This ensures compatibility with the testing environment."

        "content": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\nThe problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days, where each day features a different dish from a set of four options. The constraints are that consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last days must also differ. The challenge is to compute the number of such valid schedules efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n#### Strategies and Errors\n\n1. **Initial Approach**: The initial approach used a formula \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-1)} \\), which incorrectly assumed that the last day had 3 choices. This led to incorrect results for \\( N > 2 \\).\n\n2. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula is \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\). This accounts for:\n   - 4 choices for the first day.\n   - \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) choices for the intermediate days.\n   - 2 choices for the last day, ensuring it differs from both the previous day and the first day.\n\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using Python's `pow` function with three arguments allows efficient computation of large powers under a modulus, which is crucial for handling large \\( N \\).\n\n#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n\n- **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by adding a call to `main()` within the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block.\n- **Formula Miscalculation**: The initial miscalculation of the formula was corrected by re-evaluating the constraints and adjusting the formula to \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\).\n\n### Final Correct Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_schedules(N):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    if N == 2:\n        return (4 * 3) % MOD\n    else:\n        # Using modular exponentiation to compute 3^(N-2) % MOD\n        power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)\n        return (4 * power * 2) % MOD\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        result = calculate_schedules(N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering problem constraints and verifying the logic of mathematical formulas used in algorithmic solutions."

        "content": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem involved generating valid schedules for a sequence of days with specific constraints on dish selection. My initial approach was to use a formula based on the number of choices available each day, but I miscalculated the constraints for the last day, leading to incorrect results for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Mathematical Insight**: The official solution uses a mathematical formula that leverages properties of powers and modular arithmetic. It calculates the number of valid schedules using the expression `pow(3, n, r) + pow(-1, n) * 3`. This formula cleverly accounts for the constraints by using alternating signs and powers, which I did not initially consider.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: The use of `pow(base, exp, mod)` is efficient for computing large powers under a modulus, which is crucial given the constraints (up to \\( N = 10^9 \\)). This ensures that the solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The official solution is concise and avoids iterative or recursive approaches, which could be less efficient for very large \\( N \\). It directly computes the result using a mathematical expression, which is both elegant and effective.\n\n#### Lessons Learned:\n\n- **Understanding Constraints**: It's crucial to fully understand the problem constraints and how they affect the solution. My initial oversight in the constraints for the last day led to incorrect calculations.\n  \n- **Mathematical Formulation**: Sometimes, problems that seem combinatorial can be solved more efficiently with a mathematical formula. Exploring mathematical properties and simplifications can lead to more efficient solutions.\n\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: Using built-in functions like `pow` with a modulus is a powerful tool for handling large numbers, especially in competitive programming contexts where constraints are large.\n\nIn future problems, I will pay closer attention to the constraints and consider mathematical approaches that might simplify the problem significantly."
