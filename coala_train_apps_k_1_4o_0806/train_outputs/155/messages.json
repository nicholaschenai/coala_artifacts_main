The idea is to calculate the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index and use these results to build up the solution.\n\n2. **Recursive Function with Memoization**: Define a recursive function `max_jumps_from(i)` that returns the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. Use memoization to store results of previously computed indices to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n3. **Jumping Logic**: For each index `i`, try to jump to all possible indices `j` within the range `[i-d, i+d]` that satisfy the conditions:\n   - `arr[i] > arr[j]`\n   - All elements between `i` and `j` are less than `arr[i]`\n\n4. **Iterate Over All Indices**: Compute the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index and return the maximum of these values.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction maxJumps(arr, d):\n    n = length of arr\n    memo = array of size n initialized to -1\n\n    function max_jumps_from(i):\n        if memo[i] is not -1:\n            return memo[i]\n        \n        max_jumps = 1  // At least the current index can be visited\n\n        // Check forward jumps\n        for j from i+1 to min(i+d, n-1):\n            if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))\n            else:\n                break  // Cannot jump further in this direction\n\n        // Check backward jumps\n        for j from i-1 to max(i-d, 0):\n            if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))\n            else:\n                break  // Cannot jump further in this direction\n\n        memo[i] = max_jumps\n        return max_jumps\n\n    max_result = 0\n    for i from 0 to n-1:\n        max_result = max(max_result, max_jumps_from(i))\n\n    return max_result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxJumps(self, arr: List[int], d: int) -> int:\n        n = len(arr)\n        memo = [-1] * n\n\n        def max_jumps_from(i: int) -> int:\n            if memo[i] != -1:\n                return memo[i]\n            \n            max_jumps = 1  # At least the current index can be visited\n\n            # Check forward jumps\n            for j in range(i + 1, min(i + d + 1, n)):\n                if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n                    max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))\n                else:\n                    break  # Cannot jump further in this direction\n\n            # Check backward jumps\n            for j in range(i - 1, max(i - d - 1, -1), -1):\n                if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n                    max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))\n                else:\n                    break  # Cannot jump further in this direction\n\n            memo[i] = max_jumps\n            return max_jumps\n\n        max_result = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            max_result = max(max_result, max_jumps_from(i))\n\n        return max_result\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive function with memoization to efficiently calculate the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index, and then returns the maximum of these values."

1] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. \n    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).\n\n    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:\n    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.\n    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).\n    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.\n\n    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:\n    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.\n    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).\n\n    ## Related tasks\n\n    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence\n\n    This is in fact nearly the same problem.\n    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.\n\n    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.\n    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.\n\n    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences\n\n    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.\n    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.\n\n    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.\n    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.\n\n    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.\n\n    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence\n\n    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \\dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.\n\n    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    **Proof**:\n    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.\n\n    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.\n    We need to prove that $x = y$.\n\n    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.\n    Therefore we have $y \\ge x$.\n\n    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.\n    Suppose that $y > x$.\n    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.\n    We transform this in set in the following way:\n    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.\n    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.\n    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.\n\n    Thus it follows that $y = x$.\n\n    **Restoring the sequences**:\n    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.\n    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The problem tests the ability to manage state transitions based on conditions and constraints, which is a common pattern in dynamic programming problems.\n\nThe successful strategy involved using a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. The key was to iterate over the indices in the order of increasing values, which ensures that when calculating `dp[i]`, all potential destination indices have already been processed. This ordering is crucial because it allows us to build the solution incrementally and ensures that the `dp` values are accurate when used to update other indices.\n\nOne potential pitfall was ensuring that jumps only occur when the conditions are met (i.e., the starting index value is greater than the destination index value and all intermediate values). This was handled by breaking out of the loop when a jump was not possible, which prevents unnecessary calculations and maintains the integrity of the `dp` values.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of ordering and state management in dynamic programming, especially when dealing with constraints that affect transitions between states. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach."
