## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an array ofÂ integers arr and an integer d. In one step you can jump from index i to index:

i + x where:Â i + x < arr.length and  0 <Â x <= d.
i - x where:Â i - x >= 0 and  0 <Â x <= d.

In addition, you can only jump from index i to index jÂ if arr[i] > arr[j] and arr[i] > arr[k] for all indices k between i and j (More formally min(i,Â j) < k < max(i, j)).
You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return the maximum number of indicesÂ you can visit.
Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.
Â 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12], d = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.
Note that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9. You cannot jump to index 4 because index 5 is between index 4 and 6 and 13 > 9.
Similarly You cannot jump from index 3 to index 2 or index 1.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,3], d = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: You can start at any index. You always cannot jump to any index.

Example 3:
Input: arr = [7,6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 1
Output: 7
Explanation: Start at index 0. You can visit all the indicies. 

Example 4:
Input: arr = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 2
Output: 2

Example 5:
Input: arr = [66], d = 1
Output: 1

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `d`. We can jump from an index `i` to another index `j` if:
- `arr[i] > arr[j]`
- All elements between `i` and `j` are less than `arr[i]`
- The jump distance `|i - j|` is at most `d`

The task is to determine the maximum number of indices we can visit starting from any index in the array.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to calculate the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index and use these results to build up the solution.

2. **Recursive Function with Memoization**: Define a recursive function `max_jumps_from(i)` that returns the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. Use memoization to store results of previously computed indices to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Jumping Logic**: For each index `i`, try to jump to all possible indices `j` within the range `[i-d, i+d]` that satisfy the conditions:
   - `arr[i] > arr[j]`
   - All elements between `i` and `j` are less than `arr[i]`

4. **Iterate Over All Indices**: Compute the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index and return the maximum of these values.

## Pseudocode

```
function maxJumps(arr, d):
    n = length of arr
    memo = array of size n initialized to -1

    function max_jumps_from(i):
        if memo[i] is not -1:
            return memo[i]
        
        max_jumps = 1  // At least the current index can be visited

        // Check forward jumps
        for j from i+1 to min(i+d, n-1):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))
            else:
                break  // Cannot jump further in this direction

        // Check backward jumps
        for j from i-1 to max(i-d, 0):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))
            else:
                break  // Cannot jump further in this direction

        memo[i] = max_jumps
        return max_jumps

    max_result = 0
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        max_result = max(max_result, max_jumps_from(i))

    return max_result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxJumps(self, arr: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        memo = [-1] * n

        def max_jumps_from(i: int) -> int:
            if memo[i] != -1:
                return memo[i]
            
            max_jumps = 1  # At least the current index can be visited

            # Check forward jumps
            for j in range(i + 1, min(i + d + 1, n)):
                if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                    max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))
                else:
                    break  # Cannot jump further in this direction

            # Check backward jumps
            for j in range(i - 1, max(i - d - 1, -1), -1):
                if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                    max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))
                else:
                    break  # Cannot jump further in this direction

            memo[i] = max_jumps
            return max_jumps

        max_result = 0
        for i in range(n):
            max_result = max(max_result, max_jumps_from(i))

        return max_result
```

This solution uses a recursive function with memoization to efficiently calculate the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index, and then returns the maximum of these values.

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    It is also possible to restore the subsequence using this approach.
    This time we have to maintain two auxiliary arrays.
    One that tells us the index of the elements in $d[]$.
    And again we have to create an array of "ancestors" $p[i]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index of the previous element for the optimal subsequence ending in element $i$.

    It's easy to maintain these two arrays in the course of iteration over the array $a[]$ alongside the computations of $d[]$.
    And at the end it is not difficult to restore the desired subsequence using these arrays.

    ## Solution in $O(n \log n)$ with data structures {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n log n) with data structures"}

    Instead of the above method for computing the longest increasing subsequence in $O(n \log n)$ we can also solve the problem in a different way: using some simple data structures.

    Let's go back to the first method.
    Remember that $d[i]$ is the value $d[j] + 1$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

    Thus if we define an additional array $t[]$ such that

    $$t[a[i]] = d[i],$$

    then the problem of computing the value $d[i]$ is equivalent to finding the **maximum value in a prefix** of the array $t[]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(t[0 \dots a[i] - 1] + 1\right)$$

    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. 
    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).

    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:
    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.
    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).
    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.

    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:
    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.
    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).

    ## Related tasks

    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.

    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence

    This is in fact nearly the same problem.
    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.

    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.
    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.

    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences

    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.
    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.

    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.
    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.

    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \log n)$.

    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.

    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence

    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.

    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    **Proof**:
    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.

    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.
    We need to prove that $x = y$.

    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.
    Therefore we have $y \ge x$.

    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.
    Suppose that $y > x$.
    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.
    We transform this in set in the following way:
    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.
    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.
    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.

    Thus it follows that $y = x$.

    **Restoring the sequences**:
    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.
    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers and a maximum jump distance `d`. Starting from any index in the array, we can jump to another index if the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the destination index, and all values between these indices are also smaller than the starting index value. We can jump either forward or backward, but the jump distance cannot exceed `d`. The task is to determine the maximum number of indices we can visit by making such jumps.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. We will iterate over each index and calculate the possible jumps both forward and backward within the allowed distance `d`. For each valid jump, we update the `dp` value for the current index based on the `dp` value of the destination index. The final answer will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize dp array with all elements set to 1 (each index can visit itself)
   For each index i in the array:
       For each possible jump distance x from 1 to d:
           Check forward jump (i + x):
               If i + x is within bounds and arr[i] > arr[i + x]:
                   Update dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + dp[i + x])
               Else break (since we can't jump further)
           Check backward jump (i - x):
               If i - x is within bounds and arr[i] > arr[i - x]:
                   Update dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - x])
               Else break (since we can't jump further)
   Return the maximum value in the dp array
   ```

        indices = sorted(range(len(arr)), key=lambda i: arr[i])
        
        # Process each index in the order of increasing values

                else:

        # Return the maximum number of indices that can be visited
        return max(dp)
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index, considering both forward and backward jumps within the allowed distance `d`. The final result is the maximum value in the `dp` array.

INFO - [Task id] 155 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers and a maximum jump distance `d`. Starting from any index in the array, we can jump to another index if the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the destination index, and all values between these indices are also smaller than the starting index value. We can jump either forward or backward, but the jump distance cannot exceed `d`. The task is to determine the maximum number of indices we can visit by making such jumps.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

We will iterate over each index and calculate the possible jumps both forward and backward within the allowed distance `d`. For each valid jump, we update the `dp` value for the current index based on the `dp` value of the destination index. The final answer will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept revolves around dynamic programming and understanding how to efficiently calculate the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array given specific jump constraints. The problem tests the ability to manage state transitions based on conditions and constraints, which is a common pattern in dynamic programming problems.

The successful strategy involved using a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. The key was to iterate over the indices in the order of increasing values, which ensures that when calculating `dp[i]`, all potential destination indices have already been processed. This ordering is crucial because it allows us to build the solution incrementally and ensures that the `dp` values are accurate when used to update other indices.

One potential pitfall was ensuring that jumps only occur when the conditions are met (i.e., the starting index value is greater than the destination index value and all intermediate values). This was handled by breaking out of the loop when a jump was not possible, which prevents unnecessary calculations and maintains the integrity of the `dp` values.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of ordering and state management in dynamic programming, especially when dealing with constraints that affect transitions between states. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Both my solution and the official solution use dynamic programming to solve the problem. The idea is to maintain a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`.

2. **Handling Jumps:**
   - My solution iterates over each index and checks possible jumps both forward and backward within the allowed distance `d`. It updates the `dp` values based on valid jumps.
   - The official solution uses a stack to efficiently manage jumps and updates the `dp` array. It processes indices in a way that ensures jumps are only considered when they are valid, using a stack to track indices with values less than the current value.

3. **Efficiency and Complexity:**
   - The official solution is more efficient in handling jumps by leveraging a stack to manage indices and ensure that jumps are only considered when they are valid. This reduces unnecessary checks and updates, potentially improving performance, especially for larger arrays.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The official solution appends a large number (`1000000`) to the array to ensure that all elements are processed correctly, which is a clever trick to handle edge cases without additional checks.

In summary, while my solution correctly implements the dynamic programming approach, the official solution provides a more efficient way to manage jumps using a stack, which can be beneficial for performance. This insight into using data structures like stacks to manage state and transitions in dynamic programming problems is valuable for future problem-solving.

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] The function calculates the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array, where each jump must be to a smaller value and within a given distance. It initializes a dynamic programming array to track the maximum jumps possible from each index, starting with each index being able to visit itself. The indices are processed in increasing order of their values to ensure that jumps are only made to smaller values. For each index, it checks both forward and backward jumps within the allowed distance, updating the maximum jumps possible from that index. The function returns the maximum value from the dynamic programming array, representing the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from any index.

[Problem]
    Given an array ofÂ integers arr and an integer d. In one step you can jump from index i to index:

    i + x where:Â i + x < arr.length and  0 <Â x <= d.
    i - x where:Â i - x >= 0 and  0 <Â x <= d.

    In addition, you can only jump from index i to index jÂ if arr[i] > arr[j] and arr[i] > arr[k] for all indices k between i and j (More formally min(i,Â j) < k < max(i, j)).
    You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return the maximum number of indicesÂ you can visit.
    Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.
Â 
    Example 1:

    Input: arr = [6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12], d = 2
    Output: 4
    Explanation: You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.
    Note that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9. You cannot jump to index 4 because index 5 is between index 4 and 6 and 13 > 9.
    Similarly You cannot jump from index 3 to index 2 or index 1.

    Example 2:
    Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,3], d = 3
    Output: 1
    Explanation: You can start at any index. You always cannot jump to any index.

    Example 3:
    Input: arr = [7,6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 1
    Output: 7
    Explanation: Start at index 0. You can visit all the indicies. 

    Example 4:
    Input: arr = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 2
    Output: 2

    Example 5:
    Input: arr = [66], d = 1
    Output: 1

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= arr.length <= 1000
    1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
    1 <= d <= arr.length

                for x in range(1, d + 1):
                    if i - x >= 0 and arr[i] > arr[i - x]:
                        dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - x])
