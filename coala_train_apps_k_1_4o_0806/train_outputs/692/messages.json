The core concept was efficiently managing these operations given constraints on the number of hills and operations.\n\n    For the Type 1 operation, the challenge was to simulate jumps between hills based on height conditions. The key was to iterate over the hills to the right of the current position and find the nearest hill that is strictly higher, ensuring the search is limited to a maximum of 100 hills to the right. This required careful index management to avoid out-of-bounds errors.\n\n    For the Type 2 operation, the task was straightforward: adjust the heights of hills within a specified range. This involved iterating over the specified range and updating the heights directly.\n\n    The solution involved reading input data efficiently, processing each operation, and outputting results for Type 1 operations. The use of Python's list and range functionalities was crucial for handling the operations within the constraints. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding index-based operations and efficient iteration in large datasets.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It directly reads and processes input in a loop, which is efficient for competitive programming environments. My solution, on the other hand, parsed all input data first and then processed the queries, which is more structured but slightly less efficient in terms of immediate execution.\n\n2. **Operation Execution**: Both solutions correctly implement the operations specified by the problem. The official solution uses a single set of conditionals to handle all operations, which is compact and reduces redundancy. My solution separated the operations into distinct blocks, which can be easier to read and maintain but results in more lines of code.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: The official solution uses a simple membership check (`q not in VQ`) to handle invalid operations, which is a neat and efficient way to ensure only valid operations are processed. My solution used an `else` clause to handle invalid operations, which is functionally correct but less elegant.\n\n4. **Second Maximum/Minimum**: Both solutions handle the second maximum and minimum operations by using a sorted set to remove duplicates and sort the values. This approach ensures that the operations are correctly performed even when there are duplicate values in the range.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more concise and slightly more efficient in terms of input handling and operation execution. It demonstrates the importance of concise code in competitive programming, where execution speed and simplicity are crucial. My solution, while more verbose, provides a clear and structured approach that is easy to understand and maintain."
