## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we need to provide a specific arrangement of match outcomes. If not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Each player plays against every other player exactly once.
   - There are no ties, so each match has a winner and a loser.
   - We need to ensure that each player wins the same number of matches.

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - For each player to win the same number of matches, the total number of matches (which is `N * (N - 1) / 2`) must be divisible by `N`. This is only possible if `N` is odd. If `N` is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches.

3. **Constructing the Match Outcomes**:
   - If `N` is odd, we can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly `(N - 1) / 2` matches.
   - For each player `i`, they can win against the next `(N - 1) / 2` players in a cyclic manner.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of players `N`.
   - If `N` is even, print "NO".
   - If `N` is odd:
     - Print "YES".
     - Initialize an `N x N` matrix with all zeros.
     - For each player `i` from 0 to `N-1`:
       - For the next `(N - 1) / 2` players, set the matrix entry to 1 indicating player `i` wins.
     - Print the matrix.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        if N % 2 == 0:
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            # Create an N x N matrix initialized with '0'
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            
            # Each player i wins against the next (N-1)/2 players
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, (N // 2) + 1):
                    winner = i
                    loser = (i + j) % N
                    matrix[winner][loser] = '1'
            
            for row in matrix:
                results.append(''.join(row))
    
    # Print all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results according to the problem's requirements. It constructs a valid tournament scenario when possible and indicates when it's not possible.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept revolves around game theory and understanding winning and losing positions based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the integer \( N \). The key insight is that if you can leave your opponent with a disadvantageous position, you can secure a win.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Parity Analysis**: 
       - If \( N = 1 \), the player loses immediately because no moves are possible.
       - If \( N \) is even, the player can always make it odd for the opponent, which is disadvantageous for them.
       - If \( N \) is odd, the player can either subtract 1 or divide by an odd divisor, but the goal is to leave the opponent with an even number.

    2. **Winning Strategy**:
       - Always aim to leave the opponent with an odd number if possible, as it limits their options.
       - For even numbers, you can always win by making it odd for the opponent.

    ### Solution Approach:
    - For each test case, check the value of \( N \):
      - If \( N = 1 \), the Grinch wins.
      - If \( N \) is even, you win.
      - If \( N \) is odd, you also win because you can manipulate the number to eventually leave the Grinch with an even number.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def determine_winner(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            if N == 1:
                results.append("Grinch")
            elif N % 2 == 0:
                results.append("Me")
            else:
                results.append("Me")
        for result in results:
            print(result)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of analyzing the structure of a game to determine winning and losing positions, especially using parity as a strategic tool.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. Each player plays against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties. If it's possible, we need to provide a scenario where this is achieved. If not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Each player plays \( N-1 \) matches (since they play against every other player).
   - For all players to win the same number of matches, the total number of wins (which is the same as the total number of matches) must be divisible by \( N \).

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - If \( N \) is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches \( \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \) is not divisible by \( N \).
   - If \( N \) is odd, it is possible. We can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) matches.

3. **Constructing the Tournament**:
   - For odd \( N \), we can use a cyclic pattern to determine the winner of each match.
   - For player \( i \), they win against players \( i+1, i+2, \ldots, i+\frac{N-1}{2} \) (indices taken modulo \( N \)).

### Pseudocode

```
function solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for each N in test_cases:
        if N is even:
            print "NO"
        else:
            print "YES"
            for i from 0 to N-1:
                result = ""
                for j from 0 to N-1:
                    if i == j:
                        result += "0"
                    else if (j - i + N) % N <= (N-1)/2:
                        result += "1"
                    else:
                        result += "0"
                print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 == 0:
            print("NO")

            print("YES")

                for j in range(N):
                    if i == j:
                        result += "0"
                    elif (j - i + N) % N <= (N - 1) // 2:
                        result += "1"
                    else:
                        result += "0"
                print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 2
# test_cases = [3, 2]
# solve_tournament(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We iterate over each test case.
- **Even Check**: If \( N \) is even, print "NO" because it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches.
- **Odd Construction**: For odd \( N \), we construct a matrix where each player wins against the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a cyclic manner.
- **Matrix Construction**: For each player \( i \), we determine the outcome against every other player \( j \) using modular arithmetic to ensure cyclic behavior.

Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. Each player plays against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties. If it's possible, we need to provide a scenario where this is achieved. If not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Each player plays \( N-1 \) matches (since they play against every other player).
   - For all players to win the same number of matches, the total number of wins (which is the same as the total number of matches) must be divisible by \( N \).

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - If \( N \) is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches \( \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \) is not divisible by \( N \).
   - If \( N \) is odd, it is possible. We can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) matches.

3. **Constructing the Tournament**:
   - For odd \( N \), we can use a cyclic pattern to determine the winner of each match.
   - For player \( i \), they win against players \( i+1, i+2, \ldots, i+\frac{N-1}{2} \) (indices taken modulo \( N \)).

### Pseudocode

```
function solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for each N in test_cases:
        if N is even:
            print "NO"
        else:
            print "YES"
            for i from 0 to N-1:
                result = ""
                for j from 0 to N-1:
                    if i == j:
                        result += "0"
                    else if (j - i + N) % N <= (N-1)/2:
                        result += "1"
                    else:
                        result += "0"
                print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 == 0:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            for i in range(N):
                result = ""
                for j in range(N):
                    if i == j:
                        result += "0"
                    elif (j - i + N) % N <= (N - 1) // 2:
                        result += "1"
                    else:
                        result += "0"
                print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 2
# test_cases = [3, 2]
# solve_tournament(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We iterate over each test case.
- **Even Check**: If \( N \) is even, print "NO" because it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches.
- **Odd Construction**: For odd \( N \), we construct a matrix where each player wins against the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a cyclic manner.
- **Matrix Construction**: For each player \( i \), we determine the outcome against every other player \( j \) using modular arithmetic to ensure cyclic behavior.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve_tournament` was defined but never called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the input is read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output. The function should be called with the appropriate input to produce the expected output.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Reading Input**: We need to read the number of test cases and the list of player counts from standard input.
2. **Calling the Function**: Ensure that the function `solve_tournament` is called with the correct arguments.
3. **Output**: The function should print the results directly to standard output.

### Revised Solution

Here's the corrected code with the necessary input handling and function call:

```python
def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 == 0:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            for i in range(N):
                result = ""
                for j in range(N):
                    if i == j:
                        result += "0"
                    elif (j - i + N) % N <= (N - 1) // 2:
                        result += "1"
                    else:
                        result += "0"
                print(result)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])

# The following lines are the number of players for each test case
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

# Call the function with the parsed input
solve_tournament(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Input Handling**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases, and the subsequent elements are the number of players for each test case.
- **Function Call**: We call `solve_tournament` with the number of test cases and the list of player counts.
- **Output**: The function prints the results directly, which is expected in a competitive programming setup. 

This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the given test cases.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Pattern Generation Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. The pattern for each test case consists of `K` lines, where each line `i` (0-indexed) should display numbers from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `1` up to `i`. This requires understanding how to manipulate loops to generate sequences in both ascending and descending order.

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the logic for generating the pattern was incorrect. The mistake was in the sequence generation, where the numbers were not being appended in the correct order. The expected pattern was misunderstood, leading to incorrect outputs. The key realization was that each line should start with a descending sequence from `i` to `0` and then an ascending sequence from `1` to `i`.

    Another issue was with the output formatting. The solution initially added extra newlines between test cases, which was not required. This was fixed by carefully managing the output to ensure that test cases are separated correctly without trailing newlines.

    #### Correct Solution
    The final solution correctly implements the pattern generation by:
    - Using nested loops to construct each line of the pattern.
    - Ensuring the correct order of numbers for each line.
    - Managing the output format to match the expected results without extra newlines.

    Here is the corrected code snippet:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for K in test_cases:
            pattern = []
            for i in range(K):
                line = ""
                # Append numbers from i down to 0
                for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                    line += str(j)
                # Append numbers from 1 up to i
                for j in range(1, i + 1):
                    line += str(j)
                pattern.append(line)
            results.append("\n".join(pattern))
        # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases
        print("\n\n".join(results))

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and carefully managing output formatting in competitive programming problems.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. Each player plays against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties. If it's possible, we need to provide a scenario where this is achieved. If not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Each player plays \( N-1 \) matches (since they play against every other player).
   - For all players to win the same number of matches, the total number of wins (which is the same as the total number of matches) must be divisible by \( N \).

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - If \( N \) is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches \( \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \) is not divisible by \( N \).
   - If \( N \) is odd, it is possible. We can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) matches.

3. **Constructing the Tournament**:
   - For odd \( N \), we can use a cyclic pattern to determine the winner of each match.
   - For player \( i \), they win against players \( i+1, i+2, \ldots, i+\frac{N-1}{2} \) (indices taken modulo \( N \)).

### Pseudocode

```
function solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for each N in test_cases:
        if N is even:
            print "NO"
        else:
            print "YES"
            for i from 0 to N-1:
                result = ""
                for j from 0 to N-1:
                    if i == j:
                        result += "0"
                    else if (j - i + N) % N <= (N-1)/2:
                        result += "1"
                    else:
                        result += "0"
                print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 == 0:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            for i in range(N):
                result = ""
                for j in range(N):
                    if i == j:
                        result += "0"
                    elif (j - i + N) % N <= (N - 1) // 2:
                        result += "1"
                    else:
                        result += "0"
                print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 2
# test_cases = [3, 2]
# solve_tournament(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We iterate over each test case.
- **Even Check**: If \( N \) is even, print "NO" because it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches.
- **Odd Construction**: For odd \( N \), we construct a matrix where each player wins against the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a cyclic manner.
- **Matrix Construction**: For each player \( i \), we determine the outcome against every other player \( j \) using modular arithmetic to ensure cyclic behavior.

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve_tournament` was defined but never called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the input is read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output. The function should be called with the appropriate input to produce the expected output.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Reading Input**: We need to read the number of test cases and the list of player counts from standard input.
2. **Calling the Function**: Ensure that the function `solve_tournament` is called with the correct arguments.
3. **Output**: The function should print the results directly to standard output.

### Revised Solution

Here's the corrected code with the necessary input handling and function call:

```python
def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 == 0:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            for i in range(N):
                result = ""
                for j in range(N):
                    if i == j:
                        result += "0"
                    elif (j - i + N) % N <= (N - 1) // 2:
                        result += "1"
                    else:
                        result += "0"
                print(result)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])

# The following lines are the number of players for each test case
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

# Call the function with the parsed input
solve_tournament(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Input Handling**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases, and the subsequent elements are the number of players for each test case.
- **Function Call**: We call `solve_tournament` with the number of test cases and the list of player counts.
- **Output**: The function prints the results directly, which is expected in a competitive programming setup. 

This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to determine if it's possible for each player in a round-robin tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. The key insight was recognizing that this is only possible when the number of players \( N \) is odd. This is because, for an even \( N \), the total number of matches is not divisible evenly among all players.

The solution involved constructing a win-loss matrix for odd \( N \) using a cyclic pattern. Each player wins against the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a cyclic manner, ensuring that each player wins exactly the same number of matches.

A significant challenge was ensuring the function was called correctly and that input/output was handled properly. Initially, the function was defined but not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by reading input using `sys.stdin.read` and calling the function with parsed input data.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding the mathematical properties of the problem (divisibility and cyclic patterns) and ensuring correct input/output handling in a competitive programming context. The final solution was efficient and adhered to the constraints, successfully passing all test cases.

# Example usage:
# T = 2
# test_cases = [3, 2]
# solve_tournament(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We iterate over each test case.
- **Even Check**: If \( N \) is even, print "NO" because it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches.
- **Odd Construction**: For odd \( N \), we construct a matrix where each player wins against the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a cyclic manner.
- **Matrix Construction**: For each player \( i \), we determine the outcome against every other player \( j \) using modular arithmetic to ensure cyclic behavior.

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve_tournament` was defined but never called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the input is read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output. The function should be called with the appropriate input to produce the expected output.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Reading Input**: We need to read the number of test cases and the list of player counts from standard input.
2. **Calling the Function**: Ensure that the function `solve_tournament` is called with the correct arguments.
3. **Output**: The function should print the results directly to standard output.

### Revised Solution

Here's the corrected code with the necessary input handling and function call:

```python
def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 == 0:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            for i in range(N):
                result = ""
                for j in range(N):
                    if i == j:
                        result += "0"
                    elif (j - i + N) % N <= (N - 1) // 2:
                        result += "1"
                    else:
                        result += "0"
                print(result)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])

# The following lines are the number of players for each test case
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

# Call the function with the parsed input
solve_tournament(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Input Handling**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases, and the subsequent elements are the number of players for each test case.
- **Function Call**: We call `solve_tournament` with the number of test cases and the list of player counts.
- **Output**: The function prints the results directly, which is expected in a competitive programming setup. 

This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the given test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches, and if so, to provide a valid match outcome scenario. The key insight is that this is only possible when the number of players \( N \) is odd. This is because, for an odd \( N \), each player can win exactly \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) matches, which is evenly distributed among all players.

### Key Insights and Learnings:

1. **Odd vs. Even \( N \)**: The problem hinges on the parity of \( N \). If \( N \) is even, it's impossible to distribute wins evenly among players, as the total number of matches is not divisible by \( N \). This was a crucial insight that both my solution and the official solution correctly identified.

2. **Cyclic Pattern for Odd \( N \)**: For odd \( N \), a cyclic pattern can be used to determine the winners. Each player \( i \) wins against the next \( \frac{N-1}{2} \) players in a cyclic manner. This ensures that each player wins the same number of matches.

3. **Implementation Details**: The official solution uses a list to construct the result for each player, which is then converted to a string for output. This is a straightforward approach and aligns with the logic I used in my solution.

4. **Input Handling**: The official solution reads input directly in a loop, which is typical in competitive programming. My solution used `sys.stdin.read` to handle input, which is also a valid approach but requires careful parsing.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding the mathematical properties of the problem (in this case, the parity of \( N \)) and how they influence the solution. The cyclic pattern for odd \( N \) is a useful technique for similar problems where a balanced distribution is required.

The main function is `solve_tournament`.
INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] The function processes multiple test cases, each representing a tournament with a given number of players, and determines if a valid tournament schedule can be created. For each test case, if the number of players is even, it outputs "NO" since a valid schedule is not possible. If the number of players is odd, it outputs "YES" and constructs a schedule matrix where each player plays against others, ensuring that each player plays exactly half of the other players. The matrix is constructed such that the diagonal is filled with "0" (indicating no self-play), and the rest of the matrix is filled with "1" or "0" based on a specific condition that ensures the balance of matches. The function prints the resulting schedule for each valid tournament.

[Problem]
    A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
    Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
    With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
    Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

    -----Output:-----
    - If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
    - Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
    - If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
    - You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
    - You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
    - $2 \leq N \leq 100$

    -----Subtasks-----
    - 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
    - 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    3
    2

    -----Sample Output:-----
    YES
    010
    001
    100
    NO

    -----Explanation:-----
    One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.
