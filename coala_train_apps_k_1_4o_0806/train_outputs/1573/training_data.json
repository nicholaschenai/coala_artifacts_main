    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was to determine if it's possible for each player in a round-robin tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. The key insight was recognizing that this is only possible when the number of players \\( N \\) is odd. This is because, for an even \\( N \\), the total number of matches is not divisible evenly among all players.\n\nThe solution involved constructing a win-loss matrix for odd \\( N \\) using a cyclic pattern. Each player wins against the next \\( \\frac{N-1}{2} \\) players in a cyclic manner, ensuring that each player wins exactly the same number of matches.\n\nA significant challenge was ensuring the function was called correctly and that input/output was handled properly. Initially, the function was defined but not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by reading input using `sys.stdin.read` and calling the function with parsed input data.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of understanding the mathematical properties of the problem (divisibility and cyclic patterns) and ensuring correct input/output handling in a competitive programming context. The final solution was efficient and adhered to the constraints, successfully passing all test cases.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, the task was to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches, and if so, to provide a valid match outcome scenario. The key insight is that this is only possible when the number of players \\( N \\) is odd. This is because, for an odd \\( N \\), each player can win exactly \\( \\frac{N-1}{2} \\) matches, which is evenly distributed among all players.\n\n### Key Insights and Learnings:\n\n1. **Odd vs. Even \\( N \\)**: The problem hinges on the parity of \\( N \\). If \\( N \\) is even, it's impossible to distribute wins evenly among players, as the total number of matches is not divisible by \\( N \\). This was a crucial insight that both my solution and the official solution correctly identified.\n\n2. **Cyclic Pattern for Odd \\( N \\)**: For odd \\( N \\), a cyclic pattern can be used to determine the winners. Each player \\( i \\) wins against the next \\( \\frac{N-1}{2} \\) players in a cyclic manner. This ensures that each player wins the same number of matches.\n\n3. **Implementation Details**: The official solution uses a list to construct the result for each player, which is then converted to a string for output. This is a straightforward approach and aligns with the logic I used in my solution.\n\n4. **Input Handling**: The official solution reads input directly in a loop, which is typical in competitive programming. My solution used `sys.stdin.read` to handle input, which is also a valid approach but requires careful parsing.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding the mathematical properties of the problem (in this case, the parity of \\( N \\)) and how they influence the solution. The cyclic pattern for odd \\( N \\) is a useful technique for similar problems where a balanced distribution is required.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve_tournament]\nThe function processes multiple test cases, each representing a tournament with a given number of players, and determines if a valid tournament schedule can be created. For each test case, if the number of players is even, it outputs \"NO\" since a valid schedule is not possible. If the number of players is odd, it outputs \"YES\" and constructs a schedule matrix where each player plays against others, ensuring that each player plays exactly half of the other players. The matrix is constructed such that the diagonal is filled with \"0\" (indicating no self-play), and the rest of the matrix is filled with \"1\" or \"0\" based on a specific condition that ensures the balance of matches. The function prints the resulting schedule for each valid tournament.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to organize a round-robin tournament with an odd number of participants, ensuring that each participant wins the same number of matches. This is particularly relevant in sports or gaming events where fairness and equal opportunity are desired, and no participant should feel disheartened by losing more than others. The solution involves understanding combinatorial designs and can be applied to any situation where a balanced outcome is required among competitors. It also highlights the mathematical property that such a balanced outcome is only possible with an odd number of participants, which is a useful insight for tournament organizers."
