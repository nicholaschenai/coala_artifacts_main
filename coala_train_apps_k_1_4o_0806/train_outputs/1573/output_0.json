    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. Each player plays against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties. If it's possible, we need to provide a scenario where this is achieved. If not, we should indicate that it's impossible.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - Each player plays \\( N-1 \\) matches (since they play against every other player).\n   - For all players to win the same number of matches, the total number of wins (which is the same as the total number of matches) must be divisible by \\( N \\).\n\n2. **Feasibility Check**:\n   - If \\( N \\) is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches \\( \\frac{N(N-1)}{2} \\) is not divisible by \\( N \\).\n   - If \\( N \\) is odd, it is possible. We can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly \\( \\frac{N-1}{2} \\) matches.\n\n3. **Constructing the Tournament**:\n   - For odd \\( N \\), we can use a cyclic pattern to determine the winner of each match.\n   - For player \\( i \\), they win against players \\( i+1, i+2, \\ldots, i+\\frac{N-1}{2} \\) (indices taken modulo \\( N \\)).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction solve_tournament(T, test_cases):\n    for each N in test_cases:\n        if N is even:\n            print \"NO\"\n        else:\n            print \"YES\"\n            for i from 0 to N-1:\n                result = \"\"\n                for j from 0 to N-1:\n                    if i == j:\n                        result += \"0\"\n                    else if (j - i + N) % N <= (N-1)/2:\n                        result += \"1\"\n                    else:\n                        result += \"0\"\n                print result\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef solve_tournament(T, test_cases):\n    for N in test_cases:\n        if N % 2 == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            for i in range(N):\n                result = \"\"\n                for j in range(N):\n                    if i == j:\n                        result += \"0\"\n                    elif (j - i + N) % N <= (N - 1) // 2:\n                        result += \"1\"\n                    else:\n                        result += \"0\"\n                print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 2\n# test_cases = [3, 2]\n# solve_tournament(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We iterate over each test case.\n- **Even Check**: If \\( N \\) is even, print \"NO\" because it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches.\n- **Odd Construction**: For odd \\( N \\), we construct a matrix where each player wins against the next \\( \\frac{N-1}{2} \\) players in a cyclic manner.\n- **Matrix Construction**: For each player \\( i \\), we determine the outcome against every other player \\( j \\) using modular arithmetic to ensure cyclic behavior.",
