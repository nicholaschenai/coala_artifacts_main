[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

12  

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   Miu has a phone keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 maps to a set of letters. She types a string of digits, and we need to determine how many possible letter combinations can be formed from this string. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters:
     - 2: 3 letters (A, B, C)
     - 3: 3 letters (D, E, F)
     - 4: 3 letters (G, H, I)
     - 5: 3 letters (J, K, L)
     - 6: 3 letters (M, N, O)
     - 7: 4 letters (P, Q, R, S)
     - 8: 3 letters (T, U, V)
     - 9: 4 letters (W, X, Y, Z)
   - For each test case, calculate the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the number of letters for each digit in the string.
   - Use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the result is manageable.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function to map digits to the number of letters:
     Create a dictionary with keys as digits and values as the number of letters

   For each test case:
     Initialize a variable `result` to 1
     For each digit in the string S:
       Multiply `result` by the number of letters corresponding to the digit
       Take modulo 1000000007 of `result`
     Print the `result`
   ```

### Python Code

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def countPossibleStrings(T, test_cases):
    # Define the mapping of digits to the number of letters
    digit_to_letters_count = {
        '2': 3,  # ABC
        '3': 3,  # DEF
        '4': 3,  # GHI
        '5': 3,  # JKL
        '6': 3,  # MNO
        '7': 4,  # PQRS
        '8': 3,  # TUV
        '9': 4   # WXYZ
    }
    
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    # Process each test case
    for S in test_cases:
        result = 1
        # Calculate the number of possible strings for the given S
        for digit in S:
            result *= digit_to_letters_count[digit]
            result %= MOD  # Take modulo to keep the number manageable
        print(result)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])

# The following lines are the test cases
test_cases = data[1:T+1]

# Call the function with the input data
countPossibleStrings(T, test_cases)
```

This code reads input from standard input, processes each test case to calculate the number of possible strings, and prints the result for each test case. The results are computed using the mapping of digits to the number of letters and are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure they remain within a manageable range.

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

        1. **Reading Input**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach, but we need to ensure that the input is being processed correctly.

        2. **Output**: The code appends results to a list and then writes them all at once using `sys.stdout.write()`. This should work, but we need to ensure that the results are being computed and stored correctly.

        3. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is likely the reason why no output is being produced. The function needs to be called to execute the logic.

        4. **Logic and Computation**: The logic for computing the number of subsets seems correct based on the problem statement. However, we need to ensure that the precomputation of factorials and inverses is correct and that the binomial coefficient and power of two calculations are accurate.

        5. **Edge Cases**: We should ensure that edge cases, such as when \(K > I\), are handled correctly by returning 0.

        Let's fix the issue by ensuring the `solve()` function is called and verify the logic step-by-step.

        Here's the corrected code:

        ```python
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
            factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverse_factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    
            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD
    
            inverse_factorial[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD - 2, MOD)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverse_factorial[i] = inverse_factorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD
    
            return factorial, inverse_factorial

        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorial, inverse_factorial):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % MOD * inverse_factorial[n - k] % MOD

        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
    
            max_n = 4000

                N = int(data[index])
                Q = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                for _ in range(Q):
                    I = int(data[index])
                    K = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        binom = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorial, inverse_factorial)
                        power_of_two = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = binom * power_of_two % MOD
                        results.append(result)

        # Call the solve function to execute the solution
        solve()
        ```

        ### Key Fixes:
        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
        - **Verification**: Double-checked the logic for computing binomial coefficients and powers of two to ensure correctness.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

Miu has a phone with a keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 maps to a set of letters. She typed a string of digits, and we need to determine how many possible letter combinations can be formed from this string. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

For each test case, we need to:
- Map each digit in the string to the number of possible letters it represents.
- Calculate the total number of combinations by multiplying the number of possibilities for each digit.
- Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
Define a dictionary to map each digit to the number of possible letters.
For each test case:
    Initialize a variable to store the total combinations, starting with 1.
    For each digit in the string:
        Multiply the total combinations by the number of letters for that digit.
        Take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
    Print the total combinations for the test case.
```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

+------+-----+------+
|      |  0  |      |
+------+-----+------+

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the number of possible letter combinations that can be formed from a string of digits typed on a phone keypad. Each digit from 2 to 9 maps to a set of letters, and the challenge was to compute the total number of combinations for each test case, outputting the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Core Concepts:**
- The problem is essentially about mapping digits to their corresponding letter counts and calculating the product of these counts for a given string of digits.
- The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is crucial to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.

**Strategy:**
- A dictionary was used to map each digit to the number of possible letters it represents.
- For each test case, the total number of combinations was calculated by iterating over each digit in the string, multiplying the current total by the number of letters for that digit, and applying the modulo operation.

**Key Takeaways:**
- The problem reinforced the importance of understanding how to map inputs to outputs using dictionaries.
- It highlighted the need to handle large numbers efficiently using modulo operations.
- The solution was straightforward, but it was a good exercise in managing input/output and ensuring the solution scales with larger input sizes.

The solution was implemented successfully, and all test cases passed without any issues. This problem served as a good practice for handling combinatorial calculations and using modular arithmetic in programming.

    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution aim to calculate the number of possible letter combinations for a given string of digits, using the mapping of digits to letters on a phone keypad. However, there are some differences in the approach and implementation details.

### Key Insights:

1. **Digit to Letter Mapping:**
   - Both solutions correctly map each digit to the number of possible letters. My solution uses a dictionary for this mapping, which is clear and easy to maintain. The official solution uses conditional checks to determine the number of letters for each digit, which is less explicit but still effective.

2. **Iterating Over Digits:**
   - My solution iterates over the string representation of the input, while the official solution processes the number by repeatedly taking the modulus and dividing by 10. Both methods are valid, but my approach is more straightforward when dealing with strings directly.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The official solution includes a check for the digit '1', which maps to no letters, and handles it by setting `n1` to 1. This is a subtle point that ensures the calculation doesn't incorrectly multiply by zero. My solution inherently handles this by not including '1' in the mapping dictionary.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Both solutions correctly apply the modulo operation to prevent overflow and ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

### Reflection:

The official solution is more concise but less readable due to its use of direct arithmetic operations on the number. My solution, while slightly more verbose, is clearer in its intent by using a dictionary for mapping. This experience reinforces the importance of choosing the right data structures for clarity and maintainability. Additionally, it highlights the need to consider edge cases, such as digits that do not map to any letters, which can affect the final result.

The main function is `countPossibleStrings`.
INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] The function calculates the number of possible letter combinations for each test case string, where each digit in the string corresponds to a set of letters on a phone keypad. It uses a predefined mapping of digits to the number of possible letters (e.g., '2' maps to 3 letters: ABC). For each test case, it multiplies the number of possible letters for each digit in the string to get the total number of combinations, taking the result modulo 1,000,000,007 to handle large numbers. The results for all test cases are stored in a list and then printed, one per line.

[Problem]
    On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.
    +------+-----+------+
    |   1  |  2  |   3  |
    |      | ABC |  DEF |
    +------+-----+------+
    |   4  |  5  |   6  |
    |  GHI | JKL |  MNO |
    +------+-----+------+
    |   7  |  8  |   9  |
    | PQRS | TUV | WXYZ |
    +------+-----+------+
    |      |  0  |      |
    +------+-----+------+

    Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
    Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

    -----Input:-----
    - 
    The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
    - 
    Each test case consists of a string $S$.

    -----Output:-----
    - For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

    -----Constraints-----
    - 
    1 <= $T$ <= 10
    - 
    1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (10 points):
    - 1 <= $|S|$ <= 10
    Subtask #2 (90 points):
    - Original Constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2

    5

    72  

    -----Sample Output:-----
    3

    12  

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    - 
    Example Case 1:

    On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

    Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

    Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
    - 
    Example Case 2:
    On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

    On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

    Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

    Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.
