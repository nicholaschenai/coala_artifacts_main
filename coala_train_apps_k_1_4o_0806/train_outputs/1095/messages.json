He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick up any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. This is because the books in this subsequence do not need to be moved. The minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of this longest subsequence.\n\n1. **Identify the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):** The longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order is the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) of the given permutation.\n2. **Calculate Moves:** The minimum number of moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the number of books, `N`.\n2. Read the list of books as a permutation.\n3. Initialize an empty list `lis` to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.\n4. For each book in the permutation:\n   - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can replace an element to maintain the increasing order.\n   - If the book is larger than all elements in `lis`, append it to `lis`.\n   - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.\n5. The length of `lis` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n6. The minimum number of moves is `N - len(lis)`.\n7. Print the result.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef min_moves_to_sort_books():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n    \n    # Function to find the position to replace in LIS using binary search\n    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):\n        low, high = 0, len(lis)\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if lis[mid] < book:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        return low\n    \n    # Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    lis = []\n    for book in books:\n        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)\n        if pos < len(lis):\n            lis[pos] = book\n        else:\n            lis.append(book)\n    \n    # Minimum moves is total books minus the length of LIS\n    min_moves = N - len(lis)\n    print(min_moves)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We read the input and parse the number of books and their current order.\n- We define a helper function `binary_search_lis` to find the correct position in the `lis` list where a book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.\n- We iterate over each book, using binary search to determine where it fits in the `lis`. If it fits within the current `lis`, we replace the element at that position. If it is larger than all current elements, we append it.\n- The length of `lis` gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n- The minimum number of moves required is the total number of books minus the length of this subsequence, which we then print."

example\n\n        $$\\begin{array}{ll}\n        a &= \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\} \\\\\n        d &= \\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\\}\n        \\end{array}$$\n\n        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\\}$ or $\\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\\{0, 1\\}$ having length 2.\n\n    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.\n    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.\n\n    So let the current index be $i$.\n    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \\dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.\n    Then there are two options:\n\n    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.\n\n    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.\n        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.\n\n        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.\n        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.\n  \n        $$d[i] = \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(1, \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)\\right)$$\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {\n                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;\n                    p[i] = j;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if (d[i] > ans) {\n                ans = d[i];\n                pos = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        vector<int> subseq;\n        while (pos != -1) {\n            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);\n            pos = p[pos];\n        }\n        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());\n        return subseq;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

It maintains an array `l` where `l[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.\n\n3. **Efficiency:**\n   - My approach is more efficient for larger inputs due to its O(N log N) complexity, which is crucial given the constraint where N can be as large as 200,000.\n   - The official solution is simpler and easier to understand but may not perform well with the upper constraint limits due to its O(N^2) complexity.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe problem reinforces the importance of understanding and applying the concept of the longest increasing subsequence in sorting and sequence-related problems.

This is a common problem in computer science related to sorting and optimization. The solution involves finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the sequence, which is a well-known problem with efficient algorithms. Understanding this concept can be applied to various fields such as data analysis, logistics, and any domain where reordering or sorting with constraints is necessary.
