    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a sequence of books numbered from 1 to N, but they are currently in a random order on a shelf. We need to sort these books in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, we can pick up any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The key observation is that the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is related to the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement. If we can identify the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order, we only need to move the remaining books to their correct positions. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function findLISLength(arr):\n       Initialize an empty list 'lis'\n       For each book in 'arr':\n           If 'lis' is empty or the last element in 'lis' is less than the current book:\n               Append the current book to 'lis'\n           Else:\n               Find the position in 'lis' where the current book can replace an element to maintain sorted order\n               Replace that element with the current book\n       Return the length of 'lis'\n\n   Function minMovesToSortBooks(N, books):\n       lis_length = findLISLength(books)\n       Return N - lis_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef findLISLength(arr):\n    # This function finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    # using a binary search approach for efficiency.\n    lis = []\n    for book in arr:\n        # If lis is empty or the last element is less than the current book,\n        # append the current book to lis.\n        if not lis or lis[-1] < book:\n            lis.append(book)\n        else:\n            # Find the position to replace in lis to maintain sorted order\n            # using binary search.\n            left, right = 0, len(lis) - 1\n            while left < right:\n                mid = (left + right) // 2\n                if lis[mid] < book:\n                    left = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    right = mid\n            lis[left] = book\n    return len(lis)\n\ndef minMovesToSortBooks(N, books):\n    # Calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    lis_length = findLISLength(books)\n    # The minimum number of moves is the total number of books minus\n    # the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n    return N - lis_length\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\nN = int(data[0])\nbooks = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n\n# Output the result\nprint(minMovesToSortBooks(N, books))\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of moves required to sort the books by leveraging the concept of the longest increasing subsequence.",
