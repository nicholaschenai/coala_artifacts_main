INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are not in order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick up any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. This is because the books in this subsequence do not need to be moved. The minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of this longest subsequence.

1. **Identify the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):** The longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order is the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) of the given permutation.
2. **Calculate Moves:** The minimum number of moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of books, `N`.
2. Read the list of books as a permutation.
3. Initialize an empty list `lis` to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.
4. For each book in the permutation:
   - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can replace an element to maintain the increasing order.
   - If the book is larger than all elements in `lis`, append it to `lis`.
   - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.
5. The length of `lis` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
6. The minimum number of moves is `N - len(lis)`.
7. Print the result.

### Python Code

```python
def min_moves_to_sort_books():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    # Function to find the position to replace in LIS using binary search
    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lis[mid] < book:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
    
    # Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence
    lis = []
    for book in books:
        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
        if pos < len(lis):
            lis[pos] = book
        else:
            lis.append(book)
    
    # Minimum moves is total books minus the length of LIS
    min_moves = N - len(lis)
    print(min_moves)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We read the input and parse the number of books and their current order.
- We define a helper function `binary_search_lis` to find the correct position in the `lis` list where a book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.
- We iterate over each book, using binary search to determine where it fits in the `lis`. If it fits within the current `lis`, we replace the element at that position. If it is larger than all current elements, we append it.
- The length of `lis` gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
- The minimum number of moves required is the total number of books minus the length of this subsequence, which we then print.

    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a sequence of books numbered from 1 to N, but they are currently in a random order on a shelf. We need to sort these books in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, we can pick up any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The key observation is that the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is related to the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement. If we can identify the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order, we only need to move the remaining books to their correct positions. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function findLISLength(arr):
       Initialize an empty list 'lis'
       For each book in 'arr':
           If 'lis' is empty or the last element in 'lis' is less than the current book:
               Append the current book to 'lis'
           Else:
               Find the position in 'lis' where the current book can replace an element to maintain sorted order
               Replace that element with the current book
       Return the length of 'lis'

   Function minMovesToSortBooks(N, books):
       lis_length = findLISLength(books)
       Return N - lis_length
   ```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Output:-----
A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a sequence of books numbered from 1 to N, but they are currently in a random order on a shelf. We need to sort these books in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, we can pick up any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The key observation is that the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is related to the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement. If we can identify the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order, we only need to move the remaining books to their correct positions. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function findLISLength(arr):
       Initialize an empty list 'lis'
       For each book in 'arr':
           If 'lis' is empty or the last element in 'lis' is less than the current book:
               Append the current book to 'lis'
           Else:
               Find the position in 'lis' where the current book can replace an element to maintain sorted order
               Replace that element with the current book
       Return the length of 'lis'

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to sort a sequence of books using the minimum number of moves, where each move allows repositioning a single book. The core concept here is recognizing that the minimum number of moves is related to the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books. The strategy is to identify the LIS, as these books are already in the correct order, and only the remaining books need to be moved.

The solution involves calculating the LIS using a binary search approach to maintain efficiency, especially given the constraint where N can be as large as 200,000. The length of the LIS is subtracted from the total number of books to determine the minimum number of moves required.

The key takeaway is the application of the LIS concept to minimize operations in sorting problems. This approach is efficient and leverages the properties of subsequences to reduce computational complexity. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a sequence of books numbered from 1 to N, but they are currently in a random order on a shelf. We need to sort these books in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, we can pick up any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] The problem of sorting books with the minimum number of moves can be efficiently solved by leveraging the concept of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). Both my solution and the official solution use this concept, but they differ in implementation details.

### Key Insights:

1. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):**
   - The core idea is that the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is equal to the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This is because the LIS represents the largest subset of books that are already in the correct order, and the remaining books need to be moved.

2. **Approach Comparison:**
   - My solution uses a binary search approach to maintain and update the LIS efficiently, achieving a time complexity of O(N log N). This is done by maintaining a list that represents the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences of various lengths.
   - The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach with a nested loop, resulting in a time complexity of O(N^2). It maintains an array `l` where `l[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - My approach is more efficient for larger inputs due to its O(N log N) complexity, which is crucial given the constraint where N can be as large as 200,000.
   - The official solution is simpler and easier to understand but may not perform well with the upper constraint limits due to its O(N^2) complexity.

### Conclusion:

The problem reinforces the importance of understanding and applying the concept of the longest increasing subsequence in sorting and sequence-related problems. The binary search method for LIS is a powerful technique that can significantly optimize performance for large datasets. This experience highlights the trade-offs between simplicity and efficiency in algorithm design.

    The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

    -----Output:-----
    A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq N \leq 200000$.
    - You may also assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs, $1 \leq N \leq 5000$.

    -----Sample Input-----
    5
    2 1 4 5 3 

    -----Sample Output-----
    2
