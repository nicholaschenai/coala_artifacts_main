INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a different value of "N". We need to output the sum for each test case on a new line.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   For each test case:
   - Identify all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to "N".
   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence: 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N.
   - The largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N can be found by calculating `N // 10 * 10`.
   - The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{Number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{First term} + \text{Last term})
     \]
   - The first term is 10, and the last term is the largest multiple of 10 â‰¤ N.
   - The number of terms is the largest multiple of 10 divided by 10.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read the number of test cases, T
   For each test case:
       Read the integer N
       Calculate the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N: max_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
       Calculate the number of terms: num_terms = max_multiple // 10
       Calculate the sum using the arithmetic sequence formula:
           sum = (num_terms / 2) * (10 + max_multiple)
       Print the sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    
    results = []
    
    # Process each test case
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        # Read the integer N for the current test case
        N = int(data[i])
        
        # Calculate the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N
        max_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
        
        # Calculate the number of terms in the sequence
        num_terms = max_multiple // 10
        
        # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence
        # First term is 10, last term is max_multiple
        sum_multiples = (num_terms * (10 + max_multiple)) // 2
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(sum_multiples)
    
    # Output all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads input from standard input, processes each test case to calculate the sum of multiples of 10 up to N, and prints the result for each test case. The arithmetic sequence formula is used to efficiently compute the sum.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We need to find the N'th number in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series is defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... Given a number of test cases, each with a single integer N, we need to output the N'th number in this series.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
           - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
           - The differences between consecutive terms are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
           - These differences are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

        2. **Formulate the Series**:
           - The N'th term can be calculated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.
           - The formula for the N'th term is: `S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (N-1)^2`.

        3. **Efficient Calculation**:
           - Use the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.

        4. **Implementation**:
           - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula and output the result.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_nth_term(N):
            return (N-1) * N * (2*N-1) // 6

        function main():
            read T
            for each test case:
                read N
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                print result
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def calculate_nth_term(N):
            # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the main function to execute the program
        main()
        ```

        This solution efficiently calculates the N'th term in the series for each test case using the sum of squares formula, ensuring it handles up to 10,000 test cases and values of N efficiently.

We need to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer "N", and we need to output the sum for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Multiples of 10**:
   - Multiples of 10 are numbers like 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N.

2. **Calculate the Largest Multiple of 10**:
   - The largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N is `N // 10 * 10`.

3. **Sum of Multiples of 10**:
   - The multiples of 10 up to this largest multiple form an arithmetic series: 10, 20, 30, ..., M.
   - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: `Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2`.
   - The number of terms is `M / 10`.

4. **Implementation**:
   - For each test case, calculate the largest multiple of 10, then compute the sum using the arithmetic series formula.

## Pseudocode

```
function sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    M = (N // 10) * 10
    number_of_terms = M // 10
    sum = number_of_terms * (10 + M) // 2

    for each test case:
        read N
        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
        print result
```

   - The largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N is `N // 10 * 10`.

3. **Sum of Multiples of 10**:
   - The multiples of 10 up to this largest multiple form an arithmetic series: 10, 20, 30, ..., M.
   - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: `Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2`.
   - The number of terms is `M / 10`.

4. **Implementation**:
   - For each test case, calculate the largest multiple of 10, then compute the sum using the arithmetic series formula.

## Pseudocode

```
function sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    M = (N // 10) * 10
    number_of_terms = M // 10
    sum = number_of_terms * (10 + M) // 2
    return sum

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    # Calculate the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N
    M = (N // 10) * 10
    # Calculate the number of terms in the series
    number_of_terms = M // 10
    # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series
    sum = number_of_terms * (10 + M) // 2
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
main()
```

This solution efficiently calculates the sum of multiples of 10 for each test case using the arithmetic series formula, ensuring it handles up to 10 test cases and values of N up to 1,000,000,000 efficiently.

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The core concept here was recognizing that multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series, which can be efficiently summed using a mathematical formula.

Key steps included:
1. **Identifying the Largest Multiple of 10**: For a given N, the largest multiple of 10 is `N // 10 * 10`.
2. **Using the Arithmetic Series Formula**: The sum of multiples of 10 up to this largest multiple can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2`.

The solution involved reading multiple test cases, computing the sum for each using the above logic, and then outputting the results. This approach was efficient and handled the constraints well, especially given the large possible value of N (up to 1 billion).

The problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sequences and leveraging mathematical formulas for efficient computation. The implementation was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. This experience highlighted the utility of arithmetic series in solving problems involving sequences of numbers.

We need to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer "N", and we need to output the sum for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Multiples of 10**:
   - Multiples of 10 are numbers like 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N.

2. **Calculate the Largest Multiple of 10**:
   - The largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N is `N // 10 * 10`.

3. **Sum of Multiples of 10**:
   - The multiples of 10 up to this largest multiple form an arithmetic series: 10, 20, 30, ..., M.
   - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: `Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2`.
   - The number of terms is `M / 10`.

4. **Implementation**:
   - For each test case, calculate the largest multiple of 10, then compute the sum using the arithmetic series formula.

## Pseudocode

```
function sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    M = (N // 10) * 10
    number_of_terms = M // 10
    sum = number_of_terms * (10 + M) // 2
    return sum

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    # Calculate the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N
    M = (N // 10) * 10
    # Calculate the number of terms in the series
    number_of_terms = M // 10
    # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series
    sum = number_of_terms * (10 + M) // 2
    return sum

## Official solution
for t in range(eval(input())):
 n=eval(input())
 n-=n%10
 n/=10
 print(n*(n+1)/2*10)

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution aim to calculate the sum of multiples of 10 up to a given number "N". The key insight is recognizing that these multiples form an arithmetic series, which allows us to use a formula to compute the sum efficiently.

### Key Insights:

1. **Arithmetic Series**: Both solutions leverage the arithmetic series formula to compute the sum of multiples of 10. This is efficient and avoids iterating through each multiple, which is crucial given the constraints.

2. **Largest Multiple Calculation**: Both solutions correctly identify the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to "N" using integer division and multiplication.

3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is slightly more concise by directly adjusting "N" to the largest multiple of 10 and then using a single line to compute the sum. This reduces the number of variables and lines of code, making it more elegant.

### Differences:

- **Variable Usage**: My solution uses more intermediate variables to make the steps explicit, which can be helpful for understanding but is not strictly necessary for efficiency.
- **Conciseness**: The official solution is more concise, using fewer lines and operations to achieve the same result.

### Conclusion:

The official solution is a more concise version of the same logic I used. It highlights the importance of simplifying calculations and reducing unnecessary variables when possible. This experience reinforces the value of understanding arithmetic series and how to apply them efficiently in programming problems.
