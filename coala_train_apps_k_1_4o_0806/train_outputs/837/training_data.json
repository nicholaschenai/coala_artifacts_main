    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number \"N\" for multiple test cases. The core concept here was recognizing that multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series, which can be efficiently summed using a mathematical formula.\n\nKey steps included:\n1. **Identifying the Largest Multiple of 10**: For a given N, the largest multiple of 10 is `N // 10 * 10`.\n2. **Using the Arithmetic Series Formula**: The sum of multiples of 10 up to this largest multiple can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2`.\n\nThe solution involved reading multiple test cases, computing the sum for each using the above logic, and then outputting the results. This approach was efficient and handled the constraints well, especially given the large possible value of N (up to 1 billion).\n\nThe problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sequences and leveraging mathematical formulas for efficient computation. The implementation was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. This experience highlighted the utility of arithmetic series in solving problems involving sequences of numbers.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, both my solution and the official solution aim to calculate the sum of multiples of 10 up to a given number \"N\". The key insight is recognizing that these multiples form an arithmetic series, which allows us to use a formula to compute the sum efficiently.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Arithmetic Series**: Both solutions leverage the arithmetic series formula to compute the sum of multiples of 10. This is efficient and avoids iterating through each multiple, which is crucial given the constraints.\n\n2. **Largest Multiple Calculation**: Both solutions correctly identify the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to \"N\" using integer division and multiplication.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is slightly more concise by directly adjusting \"N\" to the largest multiple of 10 and then using a single line to compute the sum. This reduces the number of variables and lines of code, making it more elegant.\n\n### Differences:\n\n- **Variable Usage**: My solution uses more intermediate variables to make the steps explicit, which can be helpful for understanding but is not strictly necessary for efficiency.\n- **Conciseness**: The official solution is more concise, using fewer lines and operations to achieve the same result.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe official solution is a more concise version of the same logic I used. It highlights the importance of simplifying calculations and reducing unnecessary variables when possible. This experience reinforces the value of understanding arithmetic series and how to apply them efficiently in programming problems.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, where the first value is the number of test cases, T, and the subsequent values are the integers N for each test case. For each integer N, it calculates the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to N using a helper function. It stores the results for each test case in a list and then prints each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to calculate the sum of a series of numbers that are multiples of a specific number, up to a certain limit. This is a common problem in mathematics and computer science, particularly in algorithm design and optimization. The solution involves understanding arithmetic series and how to efficiently compute their sums without iterating through each number, which is crucial for handling large inputs and avoiding integer overflow. This approach can be applied to similar problems where you need to sum multiples of any number, not just 10, and can be adapted to different constraints and limits."
