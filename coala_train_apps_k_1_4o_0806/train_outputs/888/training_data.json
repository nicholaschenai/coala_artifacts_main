    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was constructing a cyclic pattern from a given string \\( S \\) to form rows of a pyramid and then counting occurrences of another string \\( T \\) within these rows. The challenge was efficiently handling very large row numbers \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)) without explicitly constructing the entire row, which would be computationally expensive.\n\nThe key strategy was to leverage the cyclic nature of \\( S \\). By using modular arithmetic, we could determine which characters from \\( S \\) appear in the row without needing to construct the entire string. This allowed us to efficiently build only the necessary portion of the row for each query.\n\nThe solution involved:\n1. Constructing the row by repeating \\( S \\) enough times to cover the required length \\( N \\) and then slicing it to the exact length.\n2. Counting the occurrences of \\( T \\) in this constructed row using a simple substring search.\n\nThis approach was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the importance of understanding and utilizing cyclic patterns in string manipulation problems.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, the task was to determine how many times a string \\( T \\) appears in a specific row of a pyramid constructed from a string \\( S \\). The challenge was to efficiently handle very large row numbers \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)) without explicitly constructing the entire row.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **KMP Algorithm for Pattern Matching**: The official solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to efficiently find all occurrences of the pattern \\( T \\) in a doubled version of \\( S \\). This is a clever use of the KMP algorithm, which is optimal for pattern searching with a time complexity of \\( O(n + m) \\), where \\( n \\) is the length of the text and \\( m \\) is the length of the pattern.\n\n2. **Handling Large Rows**: Instead of constructing the entire row for large \\( N \\), the solution calculates how many full cycles of \\( S \\) fit into \\( N \\) and handles the remainder separately. This is done using modular arithmetic and precomputed positions of \\( T \\) in the doubled \\( S \\).\n\n3. **Efficient Counting**: The solution precomputes the positions where \\( T \\) can start in the doubled \\( S \\) and uses binary search to count how many of these positions are valid for a given row length. This avoids the need to repeatedly search for \\( T \\) in each row, significantly improving efficiency.\n\n### Reflection:\n\n- **Efficiency**: The official solution is more efficient than a naive approach because it avoids constructing large strings and repeatedly searching for \\( T \\). Instead, it leverages precomputation and efficient searching techniques.\n\n- **Use of KMP**: The use of the KMP algorithm is a key insight, as it allows for efficient pattern matching, which is crucial given the constraints.\n\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution effectively uses modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows, which is a common technique in problems involving repeated patterns.\n\nThis problem highlights the importance of understanding and applying efficient algorithms like KMP for pattern matching and using mathematical insights to handle large inputs without direct computation.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: count_occurrences]\nThe function takes two strings, S and T, and a list of integers, queries, and returns a list of integers representing the number of times the string T appears as a substring in the first N characters of an infinitely repeated string S for each N in queries. For each query, it constructs a string by repeating S enough times to cover N characters, then counts how many times T appears as a substring within the first N characters of this constructed string. The results for each query are collected in a list, which is returned at the end.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze patterns in cyclic strings or sequences, especially when dealing with large datasets or strings. It is applicable in text processing, pattern matching, and data compression tasks where you need to efficiently find occurrences of a substring within a larger cyclically repeated string. This problem also highlights the importance of understanding how to handle large inputs and optimize string operations, which is crucial in competitive programming and software development where performance is key."
