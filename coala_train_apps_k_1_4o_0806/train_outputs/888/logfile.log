You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
codechef
chefcode
3
4
12

-----Sample Output:-----
0
1
181

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a string `S` and we use it to form a pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. The rows are formed by repeating the string `S` cyclically. We also have another string `T`. For each query, which provides a row number `N`, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: 
   - Each row `N` starts with the first character of `S` and continues by repeating `S` cyclically until it reaches `N` characters.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Determine the Row Content**:
   - For a given row `N`, the content is the first `N` characters of the infinite repetition of `S`.
   - This can be achieved by taking the first `N % |S|` characters of `S` and then appending `N // |S|` full repetitions of `S`.

3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:
   - For each query, construct the row as described and count how many times `T` appears as a substring.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, use modular arithmetic to determine the necessary parts of `S` to construct the row.
   - Use a sliding window or string search method to count occurrences of `T` efficiently.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    length_S = length of S
    length_T = length of T
    results = empty list

    for each query N in queries:
        full_repeats = N // length_S
        partial_length = N % length_S
        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]
        
        count = 0
        for i from 0 to N - length_T:
            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        append count to results

    return results
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    length_S = len(S)
    length_T = len(T)
    results = []

    for N in queries:
        # Calculate how many full repetitions of S are needed
        full_repeats = N // length_S
        # Calculate the remaining part of S needed
        partial_length = N % length_S
        # Construct the row content
        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]
        
        # Count occurrences of T in the row content
        count = 0
        for i in range(N - length_T + 1):
            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)

    return results

# Example usage:
# S = "codechef"
# T = "chefcode"
# queries = [4, 12, 1455]
# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Line 1-2**: Define the function `count_occurrences` which takes the string `S`, the string `T`, and a list of queries.
- **Line 3-4**: Calculate the lengths of `S` and `T`.
- **Line 5**: Initialize an empty list `results` to store the results of each query.
- **Line 7-8**: For each query `N`, calculate how many full repetitions of `S` fit into `N` and the remaining part needed.
- **Line 9**: Construct the row content by repeating `S` and adding the necessary partial part.
- **Line 12-14**: Use a loop to count how many times `T` appears in the constructed row content.
- **Line 16**: Append the count to the results list.
- **Line 18**: Return the list of results.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries Q. For each query, we need to determine the number of subsets in which the Ith number appears at the Kth position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number I to be at the Kth position in a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers smaller than I in the subset. This means we need to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, I-1\}\).

        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from \(I-1\) numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{I-1}{K-1}\).

        3. **Remaining Elements**: After placing I at the Kth position, the remaining elements of the subset can be any subset of the numbers greater than I, i.e., from the set \(\{I+1, I+2, \ldots, N\}\). There are \(2^{N-I}\) such subsets.

        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we can precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible N.

        ## Pseudocode

        1. Precompute factorials and their inverses modulo \(10^9 + 7\) up to the maximum N.
        2. For each test case:
           - For each query (I, K):
             - If \(K > I\), output 0 (impossible to have I at Kth position).
             - Otherwise, compute the number of subsets using the formula:
               \[
               \text{result} = \binom{I-1}{K-1} \times 2^{N-I} \mod (10^9 + 7)
               \]
        3. Output the result for each query.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string \( S \) and a string \( T \). Using \( S \), we form an infinite pyramid where the \( N \)-th row contains \( N \) characters, starting with the first character of \( S \) and continuing in a cyclic manner. We are asked \( Q \) queries, each asking for the number of occurrences of \( T \) in the \( N \)-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Pyramid**: Each row \( N \) of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string \( S \) cyclically until it reaches length \( N \). For example, if \( S = "codechef" \), the 12th row would be "codechefcode".

2. **Row Construction**: For a given row \( N \), the row can be constructed by taking the first \( N \) characters of the infinite repetition of \( S \).

3. **Counting Occurrences**: For each query, we need to count how many times the string \( T \) appears as a substring in the constructed row.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Directly constructing the row for very large \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)) is impractical. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine which characters from \( S \) are in the row.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - For each query with row number \( N \):
     - Construct the row by taking the first \( N \) characters from the infinite repetition of \( S \).
     - Count the occurrences of \( T \) in this row.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    results = []
    len_S = length(S)
    len_T = length(T)
    
    for each N in queries:
        row = ""
        for i from 0 to N-1:
            row += S[i % len_S]
        
        count = 0
        for i from 0 to N - len_T:
            if row[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    results = []
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)

 ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string \( S \) and a string \( T \). Using \( S \), we form an infinite pyramid where the \( N \)-th row contains \( N \) characters, starting with the first character of \( S \) and continuing in a cyclic manner. We are asked \( Q \) queries, each asking for the number of occurrences of \( T \) in the \( N \)-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Pyramid**: Each row \( N \) of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string \( S \) cyclically until it reaches length \( N \). For example, if \( S = "codechef" \), the 12th row would be "codechefcode".

2. **Row Construction**: For a given row \( N \), the row can be constructed by taking the first \( N \) characters of the infinite repetition of \( S \).

3. **Counting Occurrences**: For each query, we need to count how many times the string \( T \) appears as a substring in the constructed row.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Directly constructing the row for very large \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)) is impractical. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine which characters from \( S \) are in the row.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - For each query with row number \( N \):
     - Construct the row by taking the first \( N \) characters from the infinite repetition of \( S \).
     - Count the occurrences of \( T \) in this row.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    results = []
    len_S = length(S)
    len_T = length(T)
    
    for each N in queries:
        row = ""
        for i from 0 to N-1:
            row += S[i % len_S]
        
        count = 0
        for i from 0 to N - len_T:
            if row[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
codechef
chefcode
3
4
12
1455

-----Sample Output:-----
0
1
181

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was constructing a cyclic pattern from a given string \( S \) to form rows of a pyramid and then counting occurrences of another string \( T \) within these rows. The challenge was efficiently handling very large row numbers \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)) without explicitly constructing the entire row, which would be computationally expensive.

The key strategy was to leverage the cyclic nature of \( S \). By using modular arithmetic, we could determine which characters from \( S \) appear in the row without needing to construct the entire string. This allowed us to efficiently build only the necessary portion of the row for each query.

The solution involved:
1. Constructing the row by repeating \( S \) enough times to cover the required length \( N \) and then slicing it to the exact length.
2. Counting the occurrences of \( T \) in this constructed row using a simple substring search.

This approach was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the importance of understanding and utilizing cyclic patterns in string manipulation problems.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine how many times a string \( T \) appears in a specific row of a pyramid constructed from a string \( S \). The challenge was to efficiently handle very large row numbers \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)) without explicitly constructing the entire row.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **KMP Algorithm for Pattern Matching**: The official solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to efficiently find all occurrences of the pattern \( T \) in a doubled version of \( S \). This is a clever use of the KMP algorithm, which is optimal for pattern searching with a time complexity of \( O(n + m) \), where \( n \) is the length of the text and \( m \) is the length of the pattern.

2. **Handling Large Rows**: Instead of constructing the entire row for large \( N \), the solution calculates how many full cycles of \( S \) fit into \( N \) and handles the remainder separately. This is done using modular arithmetic and precomputed positions of \( T \) in the doubled \( S \).

3. **Efficient Counting**: The solution precomputes the positions where \( T \) can start in the doubled \( S \) and uses binary search to count how many of these positions are valid for a given row length. This avoids the need to repeatedly search for \( T \) in each row, significantly improving efficiency.

### Reflection:

- **Efficiency**: The official solution is more efficient than a naive approach because it avoids constructing large strings and repeatedly searching for \( T \). Instead, it leverages precomputation and efficient searching techniques.

- **Use of KMP**: The use of the KMP algorithm is a key insight, as it allows for efficient pattern matching, which is crucial given the constraints.

- **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution effectively uses modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows, which is a common technique in problems involving repeated patterns.

This problem highlights the importance of understanding and applying efficient algorithms like KMP for pattern matching and using mathematical insights to handle large inputs without direct computation.

The main function is `count_occurrences`.
INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] The function takes two strings, S and T, and a list of integers, queries, and returns a list of integers representing the number of times the string T appears as a substring in the first N characters of an infinitely repeated string S for each N in queries. For each query, it constructs a string by repeating S enough times to cover N characters, then counts how many times T appears as a substring within the first N characters of this constructed string. The results for each query are collected in a list, which is returned at the end.

[Problem]
    Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
    - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
    - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
    - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
    He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
    You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
    For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
    c
    co
    cod
    code
    codec
    codeco
    codecod
    codecode
    codecodec
    codecodeco
    ...

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
    - The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
    - Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
    - Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

    -----Output:-----
    - Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
    - 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
    - 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
    - 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    codechef
    chefcode
    3
    4
    12
    1455

    -----Sample Output:-----
    0
    1
    181

    -----Explanation:-----
    Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
    Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
    Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.
