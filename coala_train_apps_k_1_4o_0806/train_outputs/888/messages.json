The rows are formed by repeating the string `S` cyclically. We also have another string `T`. For each query, which provides a row number `N`, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: \n   - Each row `N` starts with the first character of `S` and continues by repeating `S` cyclically until it reaches `N` characters.\n   - For example, if `S = \"codechef\"`, the 12th row would be `\"codechefcode\"`.\n\n2. **Determine the Row Content**:\n   - For a given row `N`, the content is the first `N` characters of the infinite repetition of `S`.\n   - This can be achieved by taking the first `N % |S|` characters of `S` and then appending `N // |S|` full repetitions of `S`.\n\n3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:\n   - For each query, construct the row as described and count how many times `T` appears as a substring.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**:\n   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, use modular arithmetic to determine the necessary parts of `S` to construct the row.\n   - Use a sliding window or string search method to count occurrences of `T` efficiently.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    length_S = length of S\n    length_T = length of T\n    results = empty list\n\n    for each query N in queries:\n        full_repeats = N // length_S\n        partial_length = N % length_S\n        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]\n        \n        count = 0\n        for i from 0 to N - length_T:\n            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        append count to results\n\n    return results\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    length_S = len(S)\n    length_T = len(T)\n    results = []\n\n    for N in queries:\n        # Calculate how many full repetitions of S are needed\n        full_repeats = N // length_S\n        # Calculate the remaining part of S needed\n        partial_length = N % length_S\n        # Construct the row content\n        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]\n        \n        # Count occurrences of T in the row content\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(N - length_T + 1):\n            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        results.append(count)\n\n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# S = \"codechef\"\n# T = \"chefcode\"\n# queries = [4, 12, 1455]\n# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Line 1-2**: Define the function `count_occurrences` which takes the string `S`, the string `T`, and a list of queries.\n- **Line 3-4**: Calculate the lengths of `S` and `T`.\n- **Line 5**: Initialize an empty list `results` to store the results of each query.\n- **Line 7-8**: For each query `N`, calculate how many full repetitions of `S` fit into `N` and the remaining part needed.\n- **Line 9**: Construct the row content by repeating `S` and adding the necessary partial part.\n- **Line 12-14**: Use a loop to count how many times `T` appears in the constructed row content.\n- **Line 16**: Append the count to the results list.\n- **Line 18**: Return the list of results."

For each query, we need to determine the number of subsets in which the Ith number appears at the Kth position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number I to be at the Kth position in a subset, there must be exactly \\(K-1\\) numbers smaller than I in the subset. This means we need to choose \\(K-1\\) numbers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, I-1\\}\\).\n\n        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose \\(K-1\\) numbers from \\(I-1\\) numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{I-1}{K-1}\\).\n\n        3. **Remaining Elements**: After placing I at the Kth position, the remaining elements of the subset can be any subset of the numbers greater than I, i.e., from the set \\(\\{I+1, I+2, \\ldots, N\\}\\).

        "content": "In this problem, the task was to determine how many times a string \\( T \\) appears in a specific row of a pyramid constructed from a string \\( S \\). The challenge was to efficiently handle very large row numbers \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)) without explicitly constructing the entire row.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **KMP Algorithm for Pattern Matching**: The official solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to efficiently find all occurrences of the pattern \\( T \\) in a doubled version of \\( S \\). This is a clever use of the KMP algorithm, which is optimal for pattern searching with a time complexity of \\( O(n + m) \\), where \\( n \\) is the length of the text and \\( m \\) is the length of the pattern.\n\n2. **Handling Large Rows**: Instead of constructing the entire row for large \\( N \\), the solution calculates how many full cycles of \\( S \\) fit into \\( N \\) and handles the remainder separately. This is done using modular arithmetic and precomputed positions of \\( T \\) in the doubled \\( S \\).\n\n3. **Efficient Counting**: The solution precomputes the positions where \\( T \\) can start in the doubled \\( S \\) and uses binary search to count how many of these positions are valid for a given row length. This avoids the need to repeatedly search for \\( T \\) in each row, significantly improving efficiency.\n\n### Reflection:\n\n- **Efficiency**: The official solution is more efficient than a naive approach because it avoids constructing large strings and repeatedly searching for \\( T \\). Instead, it leverages precomputation and efficient searching techniques.\n\n- **Use of KMP**: The use of the KMP algorithm is a key insight, as it allows for efficient pattern matching, which is crucial given the constraints.\n\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution effectively uses modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows, which is a common technique in problems involving repeated patterns.\n\nThis problem highlights the importance of understanding and applying efficient algorithms like KMP for pattern matching and using mathematical insights to handle large inputs without direct computation."

        "content": "\n[description for function: count_occurrences]\nThe function takes two strings, S and T, and a list of integers, queries, and returns a list of integers representing the number of times the string T appears as a substring in the first N characters of an infinitely repeated string S for each N in queries. For each query, it constructs a string by repeating S enough times to cover N characters, then counts how many times T appears as a substring within the first N characters of this constructed string. The results for each query are collected in a list, which is returned at the end.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze patterns in cyclic strings or sequences, especially when dealing with large datasets or strings. It is applicable in text processing, pattern matching, and data compression tasks where you need to efficiently find occurrences of a substring within a larger cyclically repeated string. This problem also highlights the importance of understanding how to handle large inputs and optimize string operations, which is crucial in competitive programming and software development where performance is key."
