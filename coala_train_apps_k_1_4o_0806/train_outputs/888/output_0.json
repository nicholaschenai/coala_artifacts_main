    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a string \\( S \\) and a string \\( T \\). Using \\( S \\), we form an infinite pyramid where the \\( N \\)-th row contains \\( N \\) characters, starting with the first character of \\( S \\) and continuing in a cyclic manner. We are asked \\( Q \\) queries, each asking for the number of occurrences of \\( T \\) in the \\( N \\)-th row of the pyramid.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Pyramid**: Each row \\( N \\) of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string \\( S \\) cyclically until it reaches length \\( N \\). For example, if \\( S = \"codechef\" \\), the 12th row would be \"codechefcode\".\n\n2. **Row Construction**: For a given row \\( N \\), the row can be constructed by taking the first \\( N \\) characters of the infinite repetition of \\( S \\).\n\n3. **Counting Occurrences**: For each query, we need to count how many times the string \\( T \\) appears as a substring in the constructed row.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Directly constructing the row for very large \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)) is impractical. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine which characters from \\( S \\) are in the row.\n\n5. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each query with row number \\( N \\):\n     - Construct the row by taking the first \\( N \\) characters from the infinite repetition of \\( S \\).\n     - Count the occurrences of \\( T \\) in this row.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    results = []\n    len_S = length(S)\n    len_T = length(T)\n    \n    for each N in queries:\n        row = \"\"\n        for i from 0 to N-1:\n            row += S[i % len_S]\n        \n        count = 0\n        for i from 0 to N - len_T:\n            if row[i:i+len_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        results.append(count)\n    \n    return results\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    results = []\n    len_S = len(S)\n    len_T = len(T)\n    \n    for N in queries:\n        # Construct the N-th row\n        row = (S * ((N // len_S) + 1))[:N]\n        \n        # Count occurrences of T in the row\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(N - len_T + 1):\n            if row[i:i+len_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        results.append(count)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nS = data[0]\nT = data[1]\nQ = int(data[2])\nqueries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]\n\n# Get results\nresults = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently constructs each row by leveraging the cyclic nature of \\( S \\) and counts the occurrences of \\( T \\) in each row. The use of slicing and modular arithmetic ensures that the solution is efficient even for large values of \\( N \\).",
