    "raw_msg": "Let's address the issue with the solution by revisiting the problem statement and ensuring that the logic aligns with the expected outputs. The key insight is that the minimum awkwardness is achieved by grouping all boys together and all girls together, and the awkwardness is calculated as the product of the number of boys and the number of girls.\n\nGiven the test case `bbgg`, the expected output is `6`, which suggests that the calculation should be based on the number of pairwise interactions between boys and girls. Let's correct the solution to ensure it aligns with this understanding.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate over each test case\n    for s in test_cases:\n        # Count the number of boys ('b') and girls ('g')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_g = s.count('g')\n        \n        # Calculate the minimum awkwardness as the product of the number of boys and girls\n        # This represents the number of pairwise interactions between boys and girls\n        minimum_awkwardness = count_b * count_g\n        \n        # Output the result for the current test case\n        print(minimum_awkwardness)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# First line is the number of test cases\nT = int(data[0])\n\n# The following lines are the test cases\ntest_cases = data[1:T+1]\n\n# Call the function with the number of test cases and the list of test cases\ncalculate_minimum_awkwardness(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly compute the minimum awkwardness for each test case by counting the number of boys and girls and calculating their product, which represents the number of pairwise interactions between boys and girls. The input and output handling is designed to work with standard input and output, which is typical in competitive programming environments.",
