    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\nWe have a line of students represented by a string where 'b' stands for a boy and 'g' stands for a girl. The awkwardness of the line is defined as the sum of the distances between each boy and each girl. We need to rearrange the students to minimize this awkwardness. We are given multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to find the minimum possible awkwardness.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\nTo minimize the awkwardness, we should group all boys together and all girls together. This way, the distance between any boy and any girl is minimized. If we have `x` boys and `y` girls, the optimal arrangement is to have all boys followed by all girls (or vice versa). The minimum awkwardness is then calculated as the product of the number of boys and the number of girls, i.e., `x * y`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n```\nfunction calculate_minimum_awkwardness(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        count_b = count of 'b' in test_case\n        count_g = count of 'g' in test_case\n        minimum_awkwardness = count_b * count_g\n        print minimum_awkwardness\n```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate over each test case\n    for s in test_cases:\n        # Count the number of boys ('b') and girls ('g')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_g = s.count('g')\n        \n        # Calculate the minimum awkwardness as the product of the number of boys and girls\n        minimum_awkwardness = count_b * count_g\n        \n        # Output the result for the current test case\n        print(minimum_awkwardness)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# First line is the number of test cases\nT = int(data[0])\n\n# The following lines are the test cases\ntest_cases = data[1:T+1]\n\n# Call the function with the number of test cases and the list of test cases\ncalculate_minimum_awkwardness(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the minimum awkwardness for each test case by counting the number of boys and girls and computing their product. This approach ensures that the awkwardness is minimized by grouping all boys together and all girls together.",
