    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of multiple rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to calculate the cumulative scores after each round and determine which player had the maximum lead at any point during the game. The player with the maximum lead at any round is declared the winner. We need to output the winner and the maximum lead.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start by reading the number of rounds.\n   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.\n   - Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the player who had this lead.\n   - For each round, update the cumulative scores for both players.\n   - Calculate the lead for the current round by finding the absolute difference between the two cumulative scores.\n   - Determine which player is leading in the current round.\n   - If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded so far, update the maximum lead and the leading player.\n   - After processing all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Read N (number of rounds)\n   Initialize player1_cumulative_score = 0\n   Initialize player2_cumulative_score = 0\n   Initialize max_lead = 0\n   Initialize winner = 0\n\n   For each round from 1 to N:\n       Read scores Si and Ti for player 1 and player 2\n       Update player1_cumulative_score += Si\n       Update player2_cumulative_score += Ti\n       Calculate current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)\n       Determine current_leader = 1 if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score else 2\n       If current_lead > max_lead:\n           Update max_lead = current_lead\n           Update winner = current_leader\n\n   Output winner and max_lead\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_winner_and_lead():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    # Read number of rounds\n    N = int(data[0])\n    \n    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables\n    player1_cumulative_score = 0\n    player2_cumulative_score = 0\n    max_lead = 0\n    winner = 0\n    \n    # Process each round\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        # Read scores for the current round\n        Si, Ti = map(int, data[i].split())\n        \n        # Update cumulative scores\n        player1_cumulative_score += Si\n        player2_cumulative_score += Ti\n        \n        # Calculate current lead\n        current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)\n        \n        # Determine current leader\n        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:\n            current_leader = 1\n        else:\n            current_leader = 2\n        \n        # Update max lead and winner if current lead is greater\n        if current_lead > max_lead:\n            max_lead = current_lead\n            winner = current_leader\n    \n    # Output the winner and the maximum lead\n    print(winner, max_lead)\n\n```",
