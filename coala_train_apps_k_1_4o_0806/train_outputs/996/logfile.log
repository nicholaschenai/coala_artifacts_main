## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of multiple rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to determine the winner based on a special rule: after each round, we calculate the cumulative scores of both players and determine the leader and the lead (the difference between the leader's score and the other player's score). The winner is the player who had the maximum lead at the end of any round. We need to output the winner and the maximum lead.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing cumulative scores for both players and variables to track the maximum lead and the winner.
2. **Iterate Through Rounds**: For each round, update the cumulative scores for both players.
3. **Calculate Lead**: Determine the current lead and the leader after each round.
4. **Update Maximum Lead**: If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded so far, update the maximum lead and record the current leader as the winner.
5. **Output the Result**: After processing all rounds, output the winner and the maximum lead.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_winner_and_lead(N, scores):
    initialize player1_cumulative_score to 0
    initialize player2_cumulative_score to 0
    initialize max_lead to 0
    initialize winner to 0

    for each round in scores:
        update player1_cumulative_score with player1's score for the round
        update player2_cumulative_score with player2's score for the round

        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
            current_lead = player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 1
        else:
            current_lead = player2_cumulative_score - player1_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 2

        if current_lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = current_lead
            winner = current_leader

    return winner, max_lead
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_winner_and_lead(N, scores):
    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables
    player1_cumulative_score = 0
    player2_cumulative_score = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0

    # Iterate through each round
    for score in scores:
        # Update cumulative scores
        player1_cumulative_score += score[0]
        player2_cumulative_score += score[1]

        # Determine current lead and leader
        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
            current_lead = player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 1
        else:
            current_lead = player2_cumulative_score - player1_cumulative_score
            current_leader = 2

        # Update maximum lead and winner if current lead is greater
        if current_lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = current_lead
            winner = current_leader

    # Output the winner and the maximum lead
    print(winner, max_lead)

# Example usage:
# N = 5
# scores = [(140, 82), (89, 134), (90, 110), (112, 106), (88, 90)]
# find_winner_and_lead(N, scores)
```

This code reads the number of rounds and the scores for each round, calculates the cumulative scores, determines the leader and lead after each round, and finally outputs the winner and the maximum lead.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept revolves around game theory and understanding winning and losing positions based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the integer \( N \). The key insight is that if you can leave your opponent with a disadvantageous position, you can secure a win.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Parity Analysis**: 
       - If \( N = 1 \), the player loses immediately because no moves are possible.
       - If \( N \) is even, the player can always make it odd for the opponent, which is disadvantageous for them.
       - If \( N \) is odd, the player can either subtract 1 or divide by an odd divisor, but the goal is to leave the opponent with an even number.

    2. **Winning Strategy**:
       - Always aim to leave the opponent with an odd number if possible, as it limits their options.
       - For even numbers, you can always win by making it odd for the opponent.

    ### Solution Approach:
    - For each test case, check the value of \( N \):
      - If \( N = 1 \), the Grinch wins.
      - If \( N \) is even, you win.
      - If \( N \) is odd, you also win because you can manipulate the number to eventually leave the Grinch with an even number.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def determine_winner(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            if N == 1:
                results.append("Grinch")
            elif N % 2 == 0:
                results.append("Me")
            else:
                results.append("Me")
        for result in results:
            print(result)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of analyzing the structure of a game to determine winning and losing positions, especially using parity as a strategic tool.

   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of multiple rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to calculate the cumulative scores after each round and determine which player had the maximum lead at any point during the game. The player with the maximum lead at any round is declared the winner. We need to output the winner and the maximum lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Start by reading the number of rounds.
   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the player who had this lead.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores for both players.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round by finding the absolute difference between the two cumulative scores.
   - Determine which player is leading in the current round.
   - If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded so far, update the maximum lead and the leading player.
   - After processing all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90

Output:
1 58

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of multiple rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to calculate the cumulative scores after each round and determine which player had the maximum lead at any point during the game. The player with the maximum lead at any round is declared the winner. We need to output the winner and the maximum lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Start by reading the number of rounds.
   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the player who had this lead.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores for both players.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round by finding the absolute difference between the two cumulative scores.
   - Determine which player is leading in the current round.
   - If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded so far, update the maximum lead and the leading player.
   - After processing all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read N (number of rounds)
   Initialize player1_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize player2_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize max_lead = 0
   Initialize winner = 0

   For each round from 1 to N:
       Read scores Si and Ti for player 1 and player 2
       Update player1_cumulative_score += Si
       Update player2_cumulative_score += Ti
       Calculate current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
       Determine current_leader = 1 if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score else 2
       If current_lead > max_lead:
           Update max_lead = current_lead
           Update winner = current_leader

   Output winner and max_lead
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_winner_and_lead():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    # Read number of rounds

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to read input from standard input and output the result to standard output.
   - The input consists of multiple lines: the first line is the number of rounds, and the subsequent lines contain the scores for each round.
   - We need to calculate cumulative scores for both players after each round and determine the maximum lead and the player who had this lead.

2. **Reviewing the Code:**
   - The function `find_winner_and_lead()` is defined but not called. This is likely why no output is detected.
   - The function reads input using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is correct for reading all input at once.
   - The logic for calculating cumulative scores, determining the current leader, and updating the maximum lead is correctly implemented.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The main issue is that the function `find_winner_and_lead()` is not being called, so the code inside it is not executed.
   - In a script that reads from standard input and outputs to standard output, the function should be called directly after its definition.

4. **Correcting the Mistake:**
   - We need to ensure that the function is called so that the input is processed and the output is generated.

Let's fix the code by calling the function after its definition:

```python
def find_winner_and_lead():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    # Read number of rounds
    N = int(data[0])
    
    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables
    player1_cumulative_score = 0
    player2_cumulative_score = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0
    
    # Process each round
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        # Read scores for the current round
        Si, Ti = map(int, data[i].split())
        
        # Update cumulative scores
        player1_cumulative_score += Si
        player2_cumulative_score += Ti
        
        # Calculate current lead
        current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
        
        # Determine current leader
        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
            current_leader = 1
        else:
            current_leader = 2
        
        # Update max lead and winner if current lead is greater
        if current_lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = current_lead
            winner = current_leader
    
    # Output the winner and the maximum lead
    print(winner, max_lead)

# Call the function to execute the solution
find_winner_and_lead()
```

By calling the function `find_winner_and_lead()` at the end of the script, we ensure that the input is processed and the output is generated as expected.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their scores are multiplied by the complexity factor for questions they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it correctly is crucial in competitive programming.
    - **Zero-based Indexing**: Converting input indices to zero-based for easier array manipulation in Python.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Efficient Input Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then parsing it was effective for handling large input sizes.
    - **Iterative Updates**: Iterating over the specified range for each question and updating scores directly was straightforward and worked well within the constraints.

    ### Fixes and Learnings:
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is executed is a basic but crucial step.
    - **Output Verification**: Ensuring that results are printed correctly after processing all test cases was necessary to match expected outputs.

    This problem reinforced the importance of efficient input handling and careful index management in array-based problems. It also highlighted the need to ensure that the main logic is executed by calling the appropriate functions.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of multiple rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to calculate the cumulative scores after each round and determine which player had the maximum lead at any point during the game. The player with the maximum lead at any round is declared the winner. We need to output the winner and the maximum lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Start by reading the number of rounds.
   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the player who had this lead.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores for both players.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round by finding the absolute difference between the two cumulative scores.
   - Determine which player is leading in the current round.
   - If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded so far, update the maximum lead and the leading player.
   - After processing all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read N (number of rounds)
   Initialize player1_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize player2_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize max_lead = 0
   Initialize winner = 0

   For each round from 1 to N:
       Read scores Si and Ti for player 1 and player 2
       Update player1_cumulative_score += Si
       Update player2_cumulative_score += Ti
       Calculate current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
       Determine current_leader = 1 if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score else 2
       If current_lead > max_lead:
           Update max_lead = current_lead
           Update winner = current_leader

   Output winner and max_lead
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to read input from standard input and output the result to standard output.
   - The input consists of multiple lines: the first line is the number of rounds, and the subsequent lines contain the scores for each round.
   - We need to calculate cumulative scores for both players after each round and determine the maximum lead and the player who had this lead.

2. **Reviewing the Code:**
   - The function `find_winner_and_lead()` is defined but not called. This is likely why no output is detected.
   - The function reads input using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is correct for reading all input at once.
   - The logic for calculating cumulative scores, determining the current leader, and updating the maximum lead is correctly implemented.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The main issue is that the function `find_winner_and_lead()` is not being called, so the code inside it is not executed.
   - In a script that reads from standard input and outputs to standard output, the function should be called directly after its definition.

4. **Correcting the Mistake:**
   - We need to ensure that the function is called so that the input is processed and the output is generated.

Let's fix the code by calling the function after its definition:

```python
def find_winner_and_lead():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    # Read number of rounds
    N = int(data[0])
    
    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables
    player1_cumulative_score = 0
    player2_cumulative_score = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0
    
    # Process each round

        # Read scores for the current round
        Si, Ti = map(int, data[i].split())
        
        # Update cumulative scores
        player1_cumulative_score += Si
        player2_cumulative_score += Ti
        
        # Calculate current lead
        current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
        
        # Determine current leader
        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
            current_leader = 1
        else:
            current_leader = 2
        
        # Update max lead and winner if current lead is greater
        if current_lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = current_lead
            winner = current_leader
    
    # Output the winner and the maximum lead
    print(winner, max_lead)

# Call the function to execute the solution

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead achieved by either player at any point during the game. The solution involved reading multiple rounds of scores, calculating cumulative scores, and tracking the maximum lead and the player who achieved it.

### Key Concepts:
- **Cumulative Scores:** Continuously updating the scores for each player after every round.
- **Lead Calculation:** Determining the lead by calculating the absolute difference between the cumulative scores of the two players.
- **Tracking Maximum Lead:** Keeping track of the maximum lead encountered and the player who had this lead.

### Strategies and Fixes:
- **Input Handling:** Initially, the function was not called, which led to no output. The fix was to ensure the function is called after its definition to process the input and generate the output.
- **Standard Input/Output:** Using `sys.stdin.read()` to handle input and `print()` for output was effective for competitive programming environments.

### Code Snippet:
```python
def find_winner_and_lead():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    player1_cumulative_score = 0
    player2_cumulative_score = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0
    
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        Si, Ti = map(int, data[i].split())
        player1_cumulative_score += Si
        player2_cumulative_score += Ti
        current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
        
        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:

            winner = current_leader
    
    print(winner, max_lead)

find_winner_and_lead()
```

This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are executed in scripts that rely on standard input/output, especially in competitive programming contexts.

of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90

Output:
1 58

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of multiple rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to calculate the cumulative scores after each round and determine which player had the maximum lead at any point during the game. The player with the maximum lead at any round is declared the winner. We need to output the winner and the maximum lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Start by reading the number of rounds.
   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the player who had this lead.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores for both players.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round by finding the absolute difference between the two cumulative scores.
   - Determine which player is leading in the current round.
   - If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded so far, update the maximum lead and the leading player.
   - After processing all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read N (number of rounds)
   Initialize player1_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize player2_cumulative_score = 0
   Initialize max_lead = 0
   Initialize winner = 0

   For each round from 1 to N:
       Read scores Si and Ti for player 1 and player 2
       Update player1_cumulative_score += Si
       Update player2_cumulative_score += Ti
       Calculate current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
       Determine current_leader = 1 if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score else 2
       If current_lead > max_lead:
           Update max_lead = current_lead
           Update winner = current_leader

   Output winner and max_lead
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to read input from standard input and output the result to standard output.
   - The input consists of multiple lines: the first line is the number of rounds, and the subsequent lines contain the scores for each round.
   - We need to calculate cumulative scores for both players after each round and determine the maximum lead and the player who had this lead.

2. **Reviewing the Code:**
   - The function `find_winner_and_lead()` is defined but not called. This is likely why no output is detected.
   - The function reads input using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is correct for reading all input at once.
   - The logic for calculating cumulative scores, determining the current leader, and updating the maximum lead is correctly implemented.

3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   - The main issue is that the function `find_winner_and_lead()` is not being called, so the code inside it is not executed.
   - In a script that reads from standard input and outputs to standard output, the function should be called directly after its definition.

4. **Correcting the Mistake:**
   - We need to ensure that the function is called so that the input is processed and the output is generated.

Let's fix the code by calling the function after its definition:

```python
def find_winner_and_lead():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    # Read number of rounds
    N = int(data[0])
    
    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables
    player1_cumulative_score = 0
    player2_cumulative_score = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0
    
    # Process each round
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        # Read scores for the current round
        Si, Ti = map(int, data[i].split())
        
        # Update cumulative scores
        player1_cumulative_score += Si
        player2_cumulative_score += Ti
        
        # Calculate current lead
        current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
        
        # Determine current leader
        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
            current_leader = 1
        else:
            current_leader = 2
        
        # Update max lead and winner if current lead is greater
        if current_lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = current_lead
            winner = current_leader
    
    # Output the winner and the maximum lead
    print(winner, max_lead)

# Call the function to execute the solution
find_winner_and_lead()
```

By calling the function `find_winner_and_lead()` at the end of the script, we ensure that the input is processed and the output is generated as expected.

Now, given your insights, try to fix the solution. 
Output a block of correct python3 code to be executed and evaluated again. 

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [prompt] Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called so that the input is processed and the output is generated. Here is the corrected Python code:

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

    x, y= list(map(int, input().split()))
    s1, s2= s1+x, s2+y

if(mlead1<(mlead2)):
    print('2', mlead2)
else:
    print('1', mlead1)



INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Function Call Omission:**
   - My initial solution failed because I defined a function but forgot to call it. This is a common oversight when writing scripts that rely on standard input/output. Always ensure that the main logic is executed by calling the function.

2. **Cumulative Score Calculation:**
   - Both my solution and the official solution correctly calculate cumulative scores for each player after each round. This is crucial for determining the lead at any point in the game.

3. **Lead Calculation and Tracking:**
   - The official solution uses two variables, `mlead1` and `mlead2`, to track the maximum lead for each player separately. This approach simplifies the final decision on which player had the maximum lead overall. My solution used a single `max_lead` variable and a `winner` variable, which also worked but required additional logic to determine the winner.

4. **Efficiency and Simplicity:**
   - The official solution is concise and efficient, using fewer variables and a straightforward approach to determine the winner. It directly compares the maximum leads of both players at the end, which is a clean way to decide the winner.

5. **Learning Points:**
   - Always ensure that the main logic of the program is executed, especially when using functions.
   - Consider using separate variables to track metrics for each player if it simplifies the logic.
   - Simplicity in code can often lead to fewer errors and easier understanding, as demonstrated by the official solution.

Overall, the official solution provided a slightly more streamlined approach to solving the problem, and it reinforced the importance of ensuring that all parts of the code are executed as intended.
