INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a positive integer `n`. We need to transform `n` into `1` using the fewest number of operations. The operations allowed are:
- If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.
- If `n` is odd, replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers:
- For even numbers, the best operation is to divide by 2, as it reduces the number significantly.
- For odd numbers, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice should be made based on which operation will lead to a faster reduction to `1`.

For odd numbers:
- If `n` is `3`, decrementing to `2` is optimal because `2` can be halved to `1` in one step.
- For other odd numbers, we should consider the binary representation of `n`. If `n + 1` has more trailing zeros than `n - 1`, it is generally better to increment because it will lead to more divisions by 2 in subsequent steps.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a counter `steps` to 0.
2. While `n` is not equal to 1:
   - If `n` is even, divide `n` by 2.
   - If `n` is odd:
     - If `n` is 3, decrement `n` to 2.
     - Otherwise, check the number of trailing zeros in `n + 1` and `n - 1`.
     - If `n + 1` has more trailing zeros, increment `n`.
     - Otherwise, decrement `n`.
   - Increment the `steps` counter.
3. Return the `steps` counter.

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
        steps = 0
        while n != 1:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                # If n is even, divide by 2
                n //= 2
            else:
                # If n is odd
                if n == 3:
                    # Special case for 3, decrement to 2
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    # Check the number of trailing zeros in n+1 and n-1
                    if (n + 1) % 4 == 0 and n != 3:
                        n += 1
                    else:
                        n -= 1
            steps += 1
        return steps
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize `steps` to count the number of operations.
- We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.
- For even `n`, we simply divide by 2.
- For odd `n`, we handle the special case of `3` separately by decrementing to `2`.
- For other odd numbers, we decide between incrementing or decrementing based on the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of `n + 1` and `n - 1`.
- We increment the `steps` counter for each operation performed.
- Finally, we return the total number of steps taken to reduce `n` to `1`.

    Title: Josephus Problem
    Part: 1/1
    # Josephus Problem

    ## Statement

    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.
    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. 
    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.
    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.
    The process stops when one number remains.
    It is required to find the last number.

    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).

    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.
    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \log n)$.
    We want something better though.

    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution

    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.

    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:

    $$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
    n\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\
    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\
    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\
    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\
    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\
    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\
    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\
    \end{array}$$

    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:

    $$J_{n,k} = \left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \bmod n \right) + 1$$

    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$

    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:

    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \bmod n$$

    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.

    ## Implementation

    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;
    }
    ```

    **Non-recursive form** :

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
      	  res = (res + k) % i;
        return res + 1;
    }
    ```

    This formula can also be found analytically.
    Again here we assume 0-indexing.
    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.
    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \bmod n$.
    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \ \bmod n$.

    ## Modeling a $O(k \log n)$ solution

    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.
    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$) in one run without looping over.
    Afterwards we have $n - \lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k)$-th number.
    So we have to shift by that many.
    We can notice that $\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k$ is simply $-n \bmod k$.
    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.
    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.

    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.

    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;
        if (k == 1)
            return n-1;
        if (k > n)
            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;
        int cnt = n / k;
        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);
        res -= n % k;
        if (res < 0)
            res += n;
        else
            res += res / (k - 1);
        return res;
    }
    ```

    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:

    $$ n \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) ^ x = 1, $$

    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:

    $$\ln n + x \ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) = 0,$$ 
    $$x = - \frac{\ln n}{\ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)},$$

    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:

    $$x \approx k \ln n$$

    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \log n)$.

    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$

    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.

    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):

    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$

    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:

    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$

    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, "restarting" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:

    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \left(n-2^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor} \right)$$

    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$

    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler "The Josephus Problem" and Odlyzko, Wilf "Functional iteration and the Josephus problem").

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

You are given a positive integer `n`. You can perform the following operations to transform `n` into `1`:

1. If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.
2. If `n` is odd, you can replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to minimize the number of operations to transform `n` into `1`. The strategy involves:

1. **Even Numbers**: If `n` is even, the optimal move is to divide it by 2, as this reduces the number significantly in one step.
2. **Odd Numbers**: If `n` is odd, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice depends on the resulting number:
   - If `n + 1` is divisible by 4, incrementing might be better because it allows for a subsequent division by 2.
   - If `n - 1` is divisible by 4, decrementing might be better for the same reason.
   - Special case: If `n` is 3, decrementing to 2 is optimal because it directly leads to 1 in two steps.

### Pseudocode

```
function integerReplacement(n):
    steps = 0
    while n is not 1:
        if n is even:
            n = n / 2
        else:
            if n is 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                n = n - 1
            else:
                n = n + 1
        steps = steps + 1
    return steps
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
        steps = 0
        while n != 1:

                if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    n += 1
            steps += 1
        return steps
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize a counter `steps` to track the number of operations.
- We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.
- If `n` is even, we divide it by 2.
- If `n` is odd, we check if decrementing or incrementing is more beneficial:
  - If `n` is 3 or `(n - 1) % 4 == 0`, we decrement `n`.
  - Otherwise, we increment `n`.
- We increment the `steps` counter after each operation.
- Finally, we return the total number of steps taken to reduce `n` to `1`.

INFO - [Task id] 418 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

You are given a positive integer `n`. You can perform the following operations to transform `n` into `1`:

1. If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.
2. If `n` is odd, you can replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to minimize the number of operations to transform `n` into `1`. The strategy involves:

1. **Even Numbers**: If `n` is even, the optimal move is to divide it by 2, as this reduces the number significantly in one step.
2. **Odd Numbers**: If `n` is odd, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice depends on the resulting number:
   - If `n + 1` is divisible by 4, incrementing might be better because it allows for a subsequent division by 2.
   - If `n - 1` is divisible by 4, decrementing might be better for the same reason.
   - Special case: If `n` is 3, decrementing to 2 is optimal because it directly leads to 1 in two steps.

### Pseudocode

```
function integerReplacement(n):
    steps = 0
    while n is not 1:
        if n is even:
            n = n / 2
        else:
            if n is 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                n = n - 1
            else:
                n = n + 1
        steps = steps + 1
    return steps
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
        steps = 0
        while n != 1:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                # If n is even, divide by 2
                n //= 2
            else:
                # If n is odd, decide whether to increment or decrement
                if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    n += 1
            steps += 1
        return steps
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize a counter `steps` to track the number of operations.
- We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.
- If `n` is even, we divide it by 2.
- If `n` is odd, we check if decrementing or incrementing is more beneficial:
  - If `n` is 3 or `(n - 1) % 4 == 0`, we decrement `n`.
  - Otherwise, we increment `n`.
- We increment the `steps` counter after each operation.
- Finally, we return the total number of steps taken to reduce `n` to `1`.

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.

The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.

The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. 

Here is the final solution for reference:

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] The problem of reducing a number `n` to `1` using the minimum number of operations is a classic example of a greedy algorithm. The official solution and my approach both employ a similar strategy, but the official solution provides a more concise and potentially more efficient implementation.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Iterative Approach**: The official solution uses an iterative approach rather than a recursive one. This avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and potential stack overflow issues for large values of `n`.

2. **Bitwise Operations**: The official solution uses bitwise operations to check if `n` is even (`n & 1`), which is a common and efficient technique in competitive programming.

3. **Handling Odd Numbers**: The solution uses a simple condition to decide whether to increment or decrement an odd number:
   - If `n % 4 == 1` or `n == 3`, it decrements `n`.
   - Otherwise, it increments `n`.
   This approach is efficient because it leverages the properties of numbers modulo 4 to decide the optimal path.

4. **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient in both time and space. It operates in O(log n) time complexity due to the division by 2 operation, and it uses constant space since it doesn't rely on recursion.

### Reflection:

The official solution is insightful in its use of bitwise operations and its concise handling of odd numbers. It demonstrates the importance of understanding number properties (like modulo operations) to make optimal decisions in greedy algorithms. This problem reinforces the value of iterative solutions for problems that can be expressed recursively, especially when dealing with large input sizes.
