## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In a country popular for train travel, youÂ have planned some train travelling one year in advance.Â  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.Â  Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.
Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars;
a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars;
a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.Â  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.


Example 2:
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

Â 

Note:

1 <= days.length <= 365
1 <= days[i] <= 365
days is in strictly increasing order.
costs.length == 3
1 <= costs[i] <= 1000

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:

INFO - [Task id] 132 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   You are given a list of days when you plan to travel and the costs of three types of train passes: a 1-day pass, a 7-day pass, and a 30-day pass. Each pass allows you to travel for the specified number of consecutive days. Your task is to determine the minimum cost required to cover all the travel days using these passes.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We need to decide on which days to buy which type of pass to minimize the total cost.
   - We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll maintain a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel up to the `i-th` day of the year.
   - For each travel day, we have three choices:
     - Buy a 1-day pass and add its cost to the cost up to the previous day.
     - Buy a 7-day pass and add its cost to the cost up to 7 days before.
     - Buy a 30-day pass and add its cost to the cost up to 30 days before.
   - For days that are not travel days, the cost remains the same as the previous day.
   - The final answer will be the cost on the last travel day.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a set of travel days for quick lookup.
   Initialize a dp array of size 366 (for each day of the year) with all zeros.
   
   For each day from 1 to 365:
       If the day is not a travel day:
           Set dp[day] = dp[day - 1]
       Else:
           Calculate the cost if buying a 1-day pass: dp[day - 1] + costs[0]
           Calculate the cost if buying a 7-day pass: dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1]
           Calculate the cost if buying a 30-day pass: dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2]
           Set dp[day] to the minimum of the above three costs
   
   Return dp[last travel day]
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        # Create a set of travel days for quick lookup
        travel_days = set(days)
        
        # Initialize dp array for each day of the year
        dp = [0] * 366
        
        # Iterate over each day of the year
        for day in range(1, 366):
            if day not in travel_days:
                # If it's not a travel day, cost remains the same as the previous day
                dp[day] = dp[day - 1]
            else:
                # Calculate the cost for each type of pass
                cost1 = dp[day - 1] + costs[0]  # 1-day pass
                cost7 = dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1]  # 7-day pass
                cost30 = dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2]  # 30-day pass
                
                # Choose the minimum cost option
                dp[day] = min(cost1, cost7, cost30)
        
        # Return the cost on the last travel day
        return dp[days[-1]]
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost of covering all travel days with the available passes. The `dp` array keeps track of the minimum cost up to each day, and the solution iterates through each day of the year to update this cost based on whether it's a travel day or not.

In a country popular for train travel, youÂ have planned some train travelling one year in advance.Â  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.Â  Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of determining the number of valid trips Ryan can make between cities while satisfying specific conditions, the core concept was to use dynamic programming (DP) to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second. The problem required careful handling of conditions that specified where Ryan must be at certain times.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Graph Representation**: Cities and roads were represented as a graph using adjacency lists, which allowed efficient traversal and updates.
    - **Dynamic Programming**: A DP table `dp[t][c]` was used to store the number of ways to reach city `c` at time `t`. The transitions considered staying in the same city or moving to an adjacent city.

    ### Strategies and Fixes:
    - **Initial Oversight**: The initial solution did not enforce conditions during the DP table updates, leading to incorrect results. Conditions were only checked after the table was filled, which was insufficient.
    - **Condition Enforcement**: The solution was corrected by enforcing conditions during the DP updates. If a condition specified a city at a certain time, only that city was updated in the DP table for that time.
    - **Conflict Handling**: The solution also accounted for conflicting conditions by immediately returning 0 if two different cities were required at the same time.

    ### Lessons Learned:
    - **Function Execution**: Ensure that the main function is called to execute the logic, especially in competitive programming settings.
    - **Condition Handling in DP**: When conditions are part of the problem, they should be integrated into the DP logic rather than checked post hoc.
    - **Debugging**: The process highlighted the importance of verifying that all constraints are correctly applied during the computation, not just checked at the end. 

    This experience reinforced the importance of integrating constraints directly into the dynamic programming logic and ensuring that all parts of the solution are executed as intended.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In a country popular for train travel, youÂ have planned some train travelling one year in advance.Â  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.Â  Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.
Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars;
a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars;
a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.Â  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.


Example 2:
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

Â 

Note:

1 <= days.length <= 365
1 <= days[i] <= 365
days is in strictly increasing order.
costs.length == 3
1 <= costs[i] <= 1000

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 132 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the minimum cost to cover all the travel days given in a list. There are three types of train passes available: a 1-day pass, a 7-day pass, and a 30-day pass, each with different costs. The goal is to determine the least amount of money needed to cover all the specified travel days using these passes.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll maintain a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel up to the `i-th` day of the year. For each day in the `days` list, we will decide whether to buy a 1-day, 7-day, or 30-day pass. The cost for each option will be calculated based on the previous days' costs, and we'll choose the option with the minimum cost. If a day is not in the `days` list, the cost remains the same as the previous day.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a dp array of size 366 with all elements set to 0
   Create a set from the days list for quick lookup

   For each day from 1 to 365:
       If the day is not in the travel days set:
           Set dp[day] = dp[day - 1]
       Else:
           Calculate the cost for a 1-day pass: dp[day - 1] + costs[0]
           Calculate the cost for a 7-day pass: dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1]
           Calculate the cost for a 30-day pass: dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2]
           Set dp[day] to the minimum of the above three costs

   Return dp[365] as the result
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 132 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to use dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost of train tickets over a year, given specific travel days and ticket options. The challenge was to determine the optimal combination of 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day passes to minimize costs.

The strategy that worked involved creating a dynamic programming array `dp` where each index represented the minimum cost to cover travel up to that day. By iterating through each day of the year, we could decide whether to buy a 1-day, 7-day, or 30-day pass based on the previous days' costs. This approach allowed us to build up the solution incrementally, ensuring that each decision was optimal given the previous decisions.

A key insight was to use a set for the travel days to allow for quick lookups, which simplified the logic for determining whether a given day required a ticket. The use of `max(0, day - x)` ensured that we didn't access negative indices in the `dp` array, which was crucial for handling the start of the year correctly.

Overall, this problem reinforced the importance of dynamic programming for optimization problems where decisions depend on previous states. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

INFO - [Task id] 132 [generation text] The problem of finding the minimum cost for train travel using different types of passes was effectively solved using dynamic programming. Here are some insights and reflections based on the official solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Both my solution and the official solution use dynamic programming to solve the problem. The idea is to maintain a `dp` array where each entry `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel up to the `i-th` day of the year.

2. **Initialization and Handling Non-Travel Days:**
   - In my solution, I initialized the `dp` array with zeros and used a set to quickly check if a day is a travel day. The official solution initializes the `dp` array with `-1` for non-travel days and explicitly sets travel days to `0`. This approach is slightly different but achieves the same goal of distinguishing between travel and non-travel days.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Both solutions calculate the cost for each type of pass (1-day, 7-day, and 30-day) and update the `dp` array with the minimum cost. The official solution uses a slightly different initialization for the `dp` array, but the logic for updating costs is essentially the same.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - Both solutions have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of days in the input list. This is efficient given the constraints of the problem.

5. **Key Takeaway:**
   - The problem reinforces the utility of dynamic programming for optimization problems where decisions depend on previous states. The use of a `dp` array to store intermediate results is crucial for reducing redundant calculations and achieving an optimal solution.

Overall, the official solution is quite similar to my approach, with minor differences in initialization and handling of non-travel days. The problem was a good exercise in applying dynamic programming to a real-world scenario.

    The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.Â  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
    Output: 11
    Explanation: 
    For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
    On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
    On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
    On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
    In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.


    Example 2:
    Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
    Output: 17
    Explanation: 
    For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
    On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
    On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
    In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

Â 

    Note:

    1 <= days.length <= 365
    1 <= days[i] <= 365
    days is in strictly increasing order.
    costs.length == 3
    1 <= costs[i] <= 1000

                if day not in travel_days:
                    dp[day] = dp[day - 1]
                else:
                    # Calculate the cost for a 1-day pass
                    cost1 = dp[day - 1] + costs[0]
                    # Calculate the cost for a 7-day pass
                    cost7 = dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1]
                    # Calculate the cost for a 30-day pass
                    cost30 = dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2]
                    # Choose the minimum cost option
                    dp[day] = min(cost1, cost7, cost30)
        
            # Return the minimum cost to cover all travel days
            return dp[365]
