    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the minimum cost to cover all the travel days given in a list. There are three types of train passes available: a 1-day pass, a 7-day pass, and a 30-day pass, each with different costs. The goal is to determine the least amount of money needed to cover all the specified travel days using these passes.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll maintain a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel up to the `i-th` day of the year. For each day in the `days` list, we will decide whether to buy a 1-day, 7-day, or 30-day pass. The cost for each option will be calculated based on the previous days' costs, and we'll choose the option with the minimum cost. If a day is not in the `days` list, the cost remains the same as the previous day.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a dp array of size 366 with all elements set to 0\n   Create a set from the days list for quick lookup\n\n   For each day from 1 to 365:\n       If the day is not in the travel days set:\n           Set dp[day] = dp[day - 1]\n       Else:\n           Calculate the cost for a 1-day pass: dp[day - 1] + costs[0]\n           Calculate the cost for a 7-day pass: dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1]\n           Calculate the cost for a 30-day pass: dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2]\n           Set dp[day] to the minimum of the above three costs\n\n   Return dp[365] as the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize a dp array of size 366 with all elements set to 0\n        dp = [0] * 366\n        # Create a set from the days list for quick lookup\n        travel_days = set(days)\n        \n        # Iterate over each day of the year\n        for day in range(1, 366):\n            # If the day is not a travel day, cost remains the same as the previous day\n            if day not in travel_days:\n                dp[day] = dp[day - 1]\n            else:\n                # Calculate the cost for a 1-day pass\n                cost1 = dp[day - 1] + costs[0]\n                # Calculate the cost for a 7-day pass\n                cost7 = dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1]\n                # Calculate the cost for a 30-day pass\n                cost30 = dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2]\n                # Choose the minimum cost option\n                dp[day] = min(cost1, cost7, cost30)\n        \n        # Return the minimum cost to cover all travel days\n        return dp[365]\n```\n",
