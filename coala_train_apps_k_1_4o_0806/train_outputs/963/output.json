The key is to ensure that we are correctly using the reach of each reservoir to cover all hills optimally.\n\nThe previous solution was incorrect because it didn't properly account for the optimal placement of reservoirs considering both left and right reaches.

We then find the farthest hill to the right that can be covered by this reservoir.\n\n2. **Move to Next Uncovered Hill**: After placing a reservoir, we move to the next hill that is not covered by the current reservoir's reach.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Hills Are Covered**: We repeat this process until all hills are covered, counting the number of reservoirs placed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are using the minimum number of reservoirs by maximizing the reach of each reservoir placed.",
