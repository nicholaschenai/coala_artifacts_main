There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 102\n- 1 \u2264 K,Ai \u2264 109\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2 \n4 9\n5 2 2 4\n4 9\n5 2 18 3\n\nOutput:\nYES\nNO\n\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.\nExample case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

For each test case, we are given:\n- `N`: the number of minions.\n- `K`: the total amount of money Gru has.\n- A list of `N` integers, each representing the amount of money a minion demands.\n\nThe task is to determine if Gru can distribute all his money (`K`) among the minions such that he has no money left. Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount is less than or equal to the money he has left at that point.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. For each test case, we need to check if there is a combination of the minions' demands that sums exactly to `K`.\n2. This is a classic subset sum problem where we need to determine if a subset of the given demands can sum up to `K`.\n3. We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently:\n   - Use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a sum of `j` can be achieved with the given demands.\n   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `True` because a sum of zero can always be achieved with an empty subset.\n   - For each demand, update the `dp` array from back to front to avoid using the same demand multiple times.\n   - After processing all demands, check if `dp[K]` is `True`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction canSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, demands = test_case\n        dp = array of size (K+1) initialized to False\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        for each demand in demands:\n            for j from K down to demand:\n                if dp[j - demand] is True:\n                    dp[j] = True\n        \n        if dp[K] is True:\n            print \"YES\"\n        else:\n            print \"NO\"\n```\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef canSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, demands = test_case\n        # Initialize a dp array of size K+1 with False\n        dp = [False] * (K + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # Base case: sum of 0 is always possible\n        \n        # Process each demand\n        for demand in demands:\n            # Update dp array from back to front\n            for j in range(K, demand - 1, -1):\n                if dp[j - demand]:\n                    dp[j] = True\n        \n        # Check if we can achieve the sum K\n        if dp[K]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    K = int(data[index + 1])\n    demands = list(map(int, data[index + 2:index + 2 + N]))\n    test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n    index += 2 + N\n\n# Call the function\ncanSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case using a dynamic programming approach to solve the subset sum problem, and prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on whether Gru can spend all his money."

However, the problem requires us to determine if it's possible to distribute exactly `K` money among the minions such that each minion receives an amount less than or equal to their demand. This is a classic subset sum problem where we need to find if there exists a subset of demands that sums up to `K`.\n\n### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n1. **Misinterpretation**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the sum of all demands should equal `K`. Instead, we need to find a subset of demands that sums to `K`.\n2. **Subset Sum Problem**: The problem is essentially a subset sum problem, which requires a different approach than simply summing all demands.\n\n### Correct Approach\n\nTo solve the subset sum problem, we can use dynamic programming.

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, I gained several insights:\n\n1. **Problem Understanding**: Initially, I misunderstood the problem as simply checking if the sum of all demands equals `K`. However, the task was to determine if a subset of demands could sum to exactly `K`, which is a classic subset sum problem.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: My final solution used a dynamic programming approach to solve the subset sum problem. This approach is efficient for the given constraints and ensures that we can determine if exactly `K` money can be distributed among the minions.\n\n3. **Official Solution Insight**: The official solution uses a recursive approach to find all combinations of demands that sum to `K`. While this method is straightforward and works for small input sizes, it is less efficient than the dynamic programming approach for larger inputs due to its exponential time complexity. The recursive solution explores all possible subsets, which can be computationally expensive.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: The dynamic programming approach I implemented is more efficient in terms of time complexity, especially given the constraints where `N` can be up to 102 and `K` can be as large as 10^9. The DP solution runs in O(N * K) time, which is feasible for the problem's constraints.\n\nIn summary, this exercise reinforced the importance of correctly interpreting problem statements and choosing the right algorithmic approach based on input constraints. The dynamic programming method is a powerful tool for solving subset sum problems efficiently, and understanding its application is crucial for tackling similar challenges in the future."

        "content": "\n[description for function: can_spend_all_money]\nThe function determines if it is possible to exactly spend a given amount of money, K, using a list of demands for each test case. It iterates over each test case, initializing a boolean array, dp, of size K+1 to track achievable sums, starting with dp[0] set to True, indicating that a sum of 0 is always possible. For each demand in the list, it updates the dp array in reverse order to ensure that each demand is only used once per sum calculation. After processing all demands, it checks if dp[K] is True, meaning the exact amount K can be spent, and prints \"YES\" if so, otherwise it prints \"NO\".\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a specific sum can be achieved using a subset of given numbers, which is a classic subset sum problem. This is applicable in financial planning, resource allocation, and budgeting where you need to distribute resources exactly without any remainder. It can also be used in computer science for solving problems related to dynamic programming and combinatorial optimization, where you need to check if a target sum can be formed from a set of numbers. The solution involves using a dynamic programming approach to efficiently determine if the exact sum can be achieved, which is a common technique in algorithm design."
