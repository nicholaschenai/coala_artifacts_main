## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----

4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a number of test cases. For each test case, we are given:
- `N`: the number of minions.
- `K`: the total amount of money Gru has.
- A list of `N` integers, each representing the amount of money a minion demands.

The task is to determine if Gru can distribute all his money (`K`) among the minions such that he has no money left. Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount is less than or equal to the money he has left at that point.

### Conceptual Solution

1. For each test case, we need to check if there is a combination of the minions' demands that sums exactly to `K`.
2. This is a classic subset sum problem where we need to determine if a subset of the given demands can sum up to `K`.
3. We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently:
   - Use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a sum of `j` can be achieved with the given demands.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `True` because a sum of zero can always be achieved with an empty subset.
   - For each demand, update the `dp` array from back to front to avoid using the same demand multiple times.
   - After processing all demands, check if `dp[K]` is `True`.

### Pseudocode

```
function canSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, demands = test_case
        dp = array of size (K+1) initialized to False
        dp[0] = True
        
        for each demand in demands:
            for j from K down to demand:
                if dp[j - demand] is True:
                    dp[j] = True
        
        if dp[K] is True:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"
```

### Python Solution

```python
def canSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, demands = test_case
        # Initialize a dp array of size K+1 with False
        dp = [False] * (K + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: sum of 0 is always possible
        
        # Process each demand
        for demand in demands:
            # Update dp array from back to front
            for j in range(K, demand - 1, -1):
                if dp[j - demand]:
                    dp[j] = True
        
        # Check if we can achieve the sum K
        if dp[K]:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Example usage:
# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    K = int(data[index + 1])
    demands = list(map(int, data[index + 2:index + 2 + N]))
    test_cases.append((N, K, demands))
    index += 2 + N

# Call the function
canSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case using a dynamic programming approach to solve the subset sum problem, and prints "YES" or "NO" based on whether Gru can spend all his money.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a number of test cases. For each test case, we are given:
- `N`: the number of minions.
- `K`: the total amount of money Gru has.
- A list of `N` integers representing the amount of money each minion demands.

The task is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly all of his money (`K`) among the minions such that each minion receives an amount less than or equal to their demand. If Gru can distribute all his money in this way, we output "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Sum of Demands**: For each test case, calculate the sum of all the demands.
2. **Comparison**: Compare the sum of demands with `K`.
   - If the sum of demands is equal to `K`, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

### Pseudocode

### Explanation of the Code

- We define a function `can_spend_all_money` that processes each test case.
- For each test case, we extract `N`, `K`, and the list of demands.
- We calculate the total demand by summing up the list of demands.
- We compare the total demand with `K`. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money exactly, so we print "YES". Otherwise, we print "NO".
- The input is read from standard input, and the data is parsed into the required format for processing.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a number of test cases. For each test case, we are given:
- `N`: the number of minions.
- `K`: the total amount of money Gru has.
- A list of `N` integers representing the amount of money each minion demands.

The task is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly all of his money (`K`) among the minions such that each minion receives an amount less than or equal to their demand. If Gru can distribute all his money in this way, we output "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Sum of Demands**: For each test case, calculate the sum of all the demands.
2. **Comparison**: Compare the sum of demands with `K`.
   - If the sum of demands is equal to `K`, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
function can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        demands = test_case[1]
        
        total_demand = sum(demands)
        
        if total_demand == K:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"

# Read input
T = read integer
test_cases = []
for i from 1 to T:
    N, K = read two integers
    demands = read list of N integers
    append (N, K, demands) to test_cases

can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        demands = test_case[1]
        
        total_demand = sum(demands)
        
        if total_demand == K:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N, K = map(int, data[index:index+2])
    demands = list(map(int, data[index+2:index+2+N]))
    test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
    index += 2 + N

can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We define a function `can_spend_all_money` that processes each test case.
- For each test case, we extract `N`, `K`, and the list of demands.
- We calculate the total demand by summing up the list of demands.
- We compare the total demand with `K`. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money exactly, so we print "YES". Otherwise, we print "NO".
- The input is read from standard input, and the data is parsed into the required format for processing.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The current solution checks if the sum of all demands is exactly equal to `K`. However, the problem requires us to determine if it's possible to distribute exactly `K` money among the minions such that each minion receives an amount less than or equal to their demand. This is a classic subset sum problem where we need to find if there exists a subset of demands that sums up to `K`.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Misinterpretation**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the sum of all demands should equal `K`. Instead, we need to find a subset of demands that sums to `K`.
2. **Subset Sum Problem**: The problem is essentially a subset sum problem, which requires a different approach than simply summing all demands.

### Correct Approach

To solve the subset sum problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a subset with sum `j` can be formed using the demands, otherwise `False`.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        demands = test_case[1]
        
        # Initialize a dp array of size K+1
        dp = [False] * (K + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: sum of 0 is always possible
        
        for demand in demands:
            for j from K down to demand:
                if dp[j - demand]:
                    dp[j] = True
        
        if dp[K]:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"

# Read input

```

        # Initialize a dp array of size K+1
        dp = [False] * (K + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: sum of 0 is always possible
        
        for demand in demands:
            for j in range(K, demand - 1, -1):
                if dp[j - demand]:
                    dp[j] = True

### Explanation of the Revised Code

- We use a dynamic programming approach to solve the subset sum problem.
- We initialize a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` indicates if a subset with sum `j` can be formed.
- We iterate over each demand and update the `dp` array to reflect possible sums.
- Finally, we check if `dp[K]` is `True`, which means it's possible to distribute exactly `K` money among the minions. If so, we print "YES", otherwise "NO".

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
- 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
2 
4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.

```

### Explanation

- **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: We use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a subset with sum `j` can be formed using the demands. We initialize `dp[0]` to `True` because a sum of 0 is always possible (by choosing no elements).
- **Iterate Over Demands**: For each demand, we update the `dp` array in reverse order to avoid using the same element multiple times in the same iteration.
- **Check for Exact Sum**: After processing all demands, if `dp[K]` is `True`, it means we can distribute exactly `K` money, so we print "YES". Otherwise, we print "NO".

### Explanation

- **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: We use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a subset with sum `j` can be formed using the demands. We initialize `dp[0]` to `True` because a sum of 0 is always possible (by choosing no elements).
- **Iterate Over Demands**: For each demand, we update the `dp` array in reverse order to avoid using the same element multiple times in the same iteration.
- **Check for Exact Sum**: After processing all demands, if `dp[K]` is `True`, it means we can distribute exactly `K` money, so we print "YES". Otherwise, we print "NO".

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
- 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
2 
4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a number of test cases. For each test case, we are given:
- `N`: the number of minions.
- `K`: the total amount of money Gru has.
- A list of `N` integers representing the amount of money each minion demands.

The task is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly all of his money (`K`) among the minions such that each minion receives an amount less than or equal to their demand. If Gru can distribute all his money in this way, we output "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Sum of Demands**: For each test case, calculate the sum of all the demands.
2. **Comparison**: Compare the sum of demands with `K`.
   - If the sum of demands is equal to `K`, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
function can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        demands = test_case[1]
        
        total_demand = sum(demands)
        
        if total_demand == K:
            print "YES"
        else:

        N, K = test_case[0]

    test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
    index += 2 + N

can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We define a function `can_spend_all_money` that processes each test case.
- For each test case, we extract `N`, `K`, and the list of demands.
- We calculate the total demand by summing up the list of demands.
- We compare the total demand with `K`. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money exactly, so we print "YES". Otherwise, we print "NO".
- The input is read from standard input, and the data is parsed into the required format for processing.

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The current solution checks if the sum of all demands is exactly equal to `K`. However, the problem requires us to determine if it's possible to distribute exactly `K` money among the minions such that each minion receives an amount less than or equal to their demand. This is a classic subset sum problem where we need to find if there exists a subset of demands that sums up to `K`.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Misinterpretation**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the sum of all demands should equal `K`. Instead, we need to find a subset of demands that sums to `K`.
2. **Subset Sum Problem**: The problem is essentially a subset sum problem, which requires a different approach than simply summing all demands.

### Correct Approach

To solve the subset sum problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a subset with sum `j` can be formed using the demands, otherwise `False`.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        demands = test_case[1]
        
        # Initialize a dp array of size K+1
        dp = [False] * (K + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: sum of 0 is always possible
        
        for demand in demands:
            for j from K down to demand:
                if dp[j - demand]:
                    dp[j] = True
        
        if dp[K]:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"

# Read input

    N, K = read two integers
    demands = read list of N integers
    append (N, K, demands) to test_cases

                if dp[j - demand]:
                    dp[j] = True

can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Revised Code

- We use a dynamic programming approach to solve the subset sum problem.
- We initialize a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` indicates if a subset with sum `j` can be formed.
- We iterate over each demand and update the `dp` array to reflect possible sums.
- Finally, we check if `dp[K]` is `True`, which means it's possible to distribute exactly `K` money among the minions. If so, we print "YES", otherwise "NO".

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] In this problem, I encountered a classic subset sum challenge disguised as a money distribution problem. The task was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly `K` money among the minions, given their individual demands. Initially, I misinterpreted the problem by checking if the sum of all demands equaled `K`, which was incorrect. The correct approach was to determine if a subset of demands could sum to `K`.

The solution involved using dynamic programming to solve the subset sum problem. I used a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` indicates if a subset with sum `j` can be formed. The key was to iterate over each demand and update the `dp` array in reverse order to ensure that each demand is considered only once per iteration. This approach efficiently checks if the exact sum `K` can be achieved.

This experience reinforced the importance of correctly interpreting problem requirements and recognizing underlying patterns, such as the subset sum problem. It also highlighted the utility of dynamic programming in solving such problems efficiently. The final solution was both correct and efficient, handling the constraints effectively.

This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a number of test cases. For each test case, we are given:
- `N`: the number of minions.
- `K`: the total amount of money Gru has.
- A list of `N` integers representing the amount of money each minion demands.

The task is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly all of his money (`K`) among the minions such that each minion receives an amount less than or equal to their demand. If Gru can distribute all his money in this way, we output "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Sum of Demands**: For each test case, calculate the sum of all the demands.
2. **Comparison**: Compare the sum of demands with `K`.
   - If the sum of demands is equal to `K`, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We define a function `can_spend_all_money` that processes each test case.
- For each test case, we extract `N`, `K`, and the list of demands.
- We calculate the total demand by summing up the list of demands.
- We compare the total demand with `K`. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money exactly, so we print "YES". Otherwise, we print "NO".
- The input is read from standard input, and the data is parsed into the required format for processing.

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The current solution checks if the sum of all demands is exactly equal to `K`. However, the problem requires us to determine if it's possible to distribute exactly `K` money among the minions such that each minion receives an amount less than or equal to their demand. This is a classic subset sum problem where we need to find if there exists a subset of demands that sums up to `K`.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Misinterpretation**: The solution incorrectly assumes that the sum of all demands should equal `K`. Instead, we need to find a subset of demands that sums to `K`.
2. **Subset Sum Problem**: The problem is essentially a subset sum problem, which requires a different approach than simply summing all demands.

### Correct Approach

To solve the subset sum problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a subset with sum `j` can be formed using the demands, otherwise `False`.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        demands = test_case[1]
        
        # Initialize a dp array of size K+1
        dp = [False] * (K + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: sum of 0 is always possible
        
        for demand in demands:
            for j from K down to demand:
                if dp[j - demand]:
                    dp[j] = True
        
        if dp[K]:
            print "YES"
        else:
            print "NO"

# Read input
T = read integer
test_cases = []
for i from 1 to T:
    N, K = read two integers
    demands = read list of N integers
    append (N, K, demands) to test_cases

can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)
```

### Revised Python Solution

```python
def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        demands = test_case[1]
        
        # Initialize a dp array of size K+1
        dp = [False] * (K + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: sum of 0 is always possible
        
        for demand in demands:
            for j in range(K, demand - 1, -1):
                if dp[j - demand]:
                    dp[j] = True
        
        if dp[K]:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read input

test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):

    test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
    index += 2 + N

can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Revised Code

- We use a dynamic programming approach to solve the subset sum problem.
- We initialize a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` indicates if a subset with sum `j` can be formed.
- We iterate over each demand and update the `dp` array to reflect possible sums.
- Finally, we check if `dp[K]` is `True`, which means it's possible to distribute exactly `K` money among the minions. If so, we print "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Explanation

- **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: We use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a subset with sum `j` can be formed using the demands. We initialize `dp[0]` to `True` because a sum of 0 is always possible (by choosing no elements).
- **Iterate Over Demands**: For each demand, we update the `dp` array in reverse order to avoid using the same element multiple times in the same iteration.
- **Check for Exact Sum**: After processing all demands, if `dp[K]` is `True`, it means we can distribute exactly `K` money, so we print "YES". Otherwise, we print "NO".

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, I gained several insights:

1. **Problem Understanding**: Initially, I misunderstood the problem as simply checking if the sum of all demands equals `K`. However, the task was to determine if a subset of demands could sum to exactly `K`, which is a classic subset sum problem.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: My final solution used a dynamic programming approach to solve the subset sum problem. This approach is efficient for the given constraints and ensures that we can determine if exactly `K` money can be distributed among the minions.

3. **Official Solution Insight**: The official solution uses a recursive approach to find all combinations of demands that sum to `K`. While this method is straightforward and works for small input sizes, it is less efficient than the dynamic programming approach for larger inputs due to its exponential time complexity. The recursive solution explores all possible subsets, which can be computationally expensive.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**: The dynamic programming approach I implemented is more efficient in terms of time complexity, especially given the constraints where `N` can be up to 102 and `K` can be as large as 10^9. The DP solution runs in O(N * K) time, which is feasible for the problem's constraints.

In summary, this exercise reinforced the importance of correctly interpreting problem statements and choosing the right algorithmic approach based on input constraints. The dynamic programming method is a powerful tool for solving subset sum problems efficiently, and understanding its application is crucial for tackling similar challenges in the future.

[Problem]
    This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

    -----Input-----
    First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

    -----Output-----
    Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
    - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
    - 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

    Input:
    2 
    4 9
    5 2 2 4
    4 9
    5 2 18 3

    Output:
    YES
    NO


    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
    Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.
