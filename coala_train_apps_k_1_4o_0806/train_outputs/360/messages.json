We need to ship all these packages within a given number of days, `D`. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded on any day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to find the minimum possible weight capacity of the ship that allows us to ship all packages within `D` days.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - The minimum possible capacity of the ship must be at least the weight of the heaviest package, because we cannot split packages.\n   - The maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights, which would allow us to ship all packages in one day.\n   - We can use a binary search to find the minimum capacity between these two extremes.\n   - For each capacity value in our binary search, we simulate the shipping process to check if it's possible to ship all packages within `D` days.\n   - If a capacity allows shipping within `D` days, we try a smaller capacity; otherwise, we increase the capacity.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function canShip(weights, D, capacity):\n       Initialize days to 1\n       Initialize current_weight to 0\n       For each weight in weights:\n           If current_weight + weight > capacity:\n               Increment days\n               Set current_weight to 0\n           Add weight to current_weight\n       Return whether days <= D\n\n   Define function shipWithinDays(weights, D):\n       Set left to max(weights)\n       Set right to sum(weights)\n       While left < right:\n           Set mid to (left + right) // 2\n           If canShip(weights, D, mid):\n               Set right to mid\n           Else:\n               Set left to mid + 1\n       Return left\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    # Helper function to determine if we can ship within D days with given capacity\n    def canShip(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:\n        days = 1  # Start with the first day\n        current_weight = 0  # Current weight on the ship for the current day\n        \n        for weight in weights:\n            # If adding this package exceeds capacity, we need a new day\n            if current_weight + weight > capacity:\n                days += 1  # Increment the day count\n                current_weight = 0  # Reset current weight for the new day\n            \n            current_weight += weight  # Add the package to the current day's load\n        \n        # Check if the number of days used is within the allowed days\n        return days <= D\n\n    # Main function to find the minimum ship capacity to ship within D days\n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:\n        left = max(weights)  # Minimum capacity must be at least the heaviest package\n        right = sum(weights)  # Maximum capacity is the sum of all weights\n        \n        # Binary search for the minimum capacity\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2  # Midpoint of current capacity range\n            \n            # Check if we can ship with this capacity\n            if self.canShip(weights, D, mid):\n                right = mid  # Try a smaller capacity\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1  # Increase capacity\n        \n        return left  # The minimum capacity that works\n```\n\nThis solution uses a binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity needed to ship all packages within the given number of days. The `canShip` helper function checks if a given capacity is sufficient to meet the requirement."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days, where each day features a different dish from a set of four options. The constraints are that consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last days must also differ. The challenge is to compute the number of such valid schedules efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    1. **Initial Approach**: The initial approach used a formula \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-1)} \\), which incorrectly assumed that the last day had 3 choices. This led to incorrect results for \\( N > 2 \\).\n\n    2. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula is \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\). This accounts for:\n       - 4 choices for the first day.\n       - \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) choices for the intermediate days.\n       - 2 choices for the last day, ensuring it differs from both the previous day and the first day.\n\n    3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using Python's `pow` function with three arguments allows efficient computation of large powers under a modulus, which is crucial for handling large \\( N \\).\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by adding a call to `main()` within the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block.\n    - **Formula Miscalculation**: The initial miscalculation of the formula was corrected by re-evaluating the constraints and adjusting the formula to \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\).\n\n    ### Final Correct Code\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return (4 * 3) % MOD\n        else:\n            # Using modular exponentiation to compute 3^(N-2) % MOD\n            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)\n            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = calculate_schedules(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    # Call the main function to execute the program\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering problem constraints and verifying the logic of mathematical formulas used in algorithmic solutions.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Each package has a weight, and they must be loaded onto a ship in the order they appear on the conveyor belt. The ship has a maximum weight capacity, and we need to determine the minimum capacity required to ship all packages within `D` days.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We must ship all packages in the order they appear.\n   - We cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity on any given day.\n   - We need to find the minimum capacity that allows us to ship all packages within `D` days.\n\n2. **Binary Search Approach**:\n   - The minimum possible capacity is the weight of the heaviest package (since we must be able to ship each package individually).\n   - The maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights (if we ship all packages in one day).\n   - Use binary search to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within `D` days.\n\n3. **Feasibility Check**:\n   - For a given capacity, simulate the shipping process to check if all packages can be shipped within `D` days.\n   - Start loading packages onto the ship until adding another package would exceed the capacity.\n   - If the ship is full, increment the day count and start a new day.\n   - If the total days used exceeds `D`, the capacity is too small.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction shipWithinDays(weights, D):\n    define feasible(capacity):\n        days = 1\n        current_weight = 0\n        for weight in weights:\n            if current_weight + weight > capacity:\n                days += 1\n                current_weight = 0\n            current_weight += weight\n        return days <= D\n\n    left = max(weights)\n    right = sum(weights)\n\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if feasible(mid):\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n\n    return left\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:\n        # Helper function to check if a given capacity can ship all packages within D days\n        def feasible(capacity: int) -> bool:\n            days = 1\n            current_weight = 0\n            for weight in weights:\n                if current_weight + weight > capacity:\n                    days += 1\n                    current_weight = 0\n                current_weight += weight\n            return days <= D\n\n        # Binary search for the minimum capacity\n        left = max(weights)\n        right = sum(weights)\n\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if feasible(mid):\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n\n        return left\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **feasible Function**: This function checks if a given capacity can ship all packages within `D` days. It iterates over the weights, accumulating them until the capacity is exceeded, then starts a new day.\n- **Binary Search**: We perform a binary search between the maximum single package weight and the total weight of all packages. The search narrows down to the minimum capacity that allows shipping within `D` days."

Here are some insights and reflections based on the official solution:\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Binary Search on Capacity**: Both my solution and the official solution use binary search to find the minimum capacity. The key is to determine the feasible range for the ship's capacity, which is between the maximum single package weight and a calculated upper bound.\n\n2. **Upper Bound Calculation**: The official solution uses `right = left * len(weights) // D` as the upper bound for the binary search. This is a more refined upper bound than simply using the sum of all weights, as it considers the average weight per day, which can potentially reduce the search space.\n\n3. **Feasibility Check**: Both solutions use a similar approach to check if a given capacity can ship all packages within `D` days. The process involves iterating through the weights and counting the number of days required to ship them without exceeding the capacity.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It uses a single pass through the weights to check feasibility, which is optimal.\n\n### Reflection\n\n- **Understanding Constraints**: The problem emphasizes the importance of understanding constraints and how they can be leveraged to optimize the solution. The use of binary search is a powerful technique when dealing with problems that require finding a minimum or maximum value under certain conditions.\n\n- **Refinement of Bounds**: The official solution's method of calculating the upper bound for the binary search is insightful. It shows that understanding the problem's constraints can lead to more efficient solutions by narrowing down the search space.\n\n- **Code Clarity**: The official solution is concise and clear, demonstrating the importance of writing clean and understandable code, especially when implementing algorithms like binary search.\n\nOverall, this problem reinforces the utility of binary search in optimization problems and highlights the importance of carefully considering problem constraints to improve solution efficiency."
