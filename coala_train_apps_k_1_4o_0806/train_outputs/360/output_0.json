    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe have a conveyor belt with packages that need to be shipped within a specified number of days, `D`. Each package has a weight, and they must be loaded onto a ship in the order they appear on the conveyor belt. The ship has a maximum weight capacity, and we need to determine the minimum capacity required to ship all packages within `D` days.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - We must ship all packages in the order they appear.\n   - We cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity on any given day.\n   - We need to find the minimum capacity that allows us to ship all packages within `D` days.\n\n2. **Binary Search Approach**:\n   - The minimum possible capacity is the weight of the heaviest package (since we must be able to ship each package individually).\n   - The maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights (if we ship all packages in one day).\n   - Use binary search to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within `D` days.\n\n3. **Feasibility Check**:\n   - For a given capacity, simulate the shipping process to check if all packages can be shipped within `D` days.\n   - Start loading packages onto the ship until adding another package would exceed the capacity.\n   - If the ship is full, increment the day count and start a new day.\n   - If the total days used exceeds `D`, the capacity is too small.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction shipWithinDays(weights, D):\n    define feasible(capacity):\n        days = 1\n        current_weight = 0\n        for weight in weights:\n            if current_weight + weight > capacity:\n                days += 1\n                current_weight = 0\n            current_weight += weight\n        return days <= D\n\n    left = max(weights)\n    right = sum(weights)\n\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if feasible(mid):\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n\n    return left\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:\n        # Helper function to check if a given capacity can ship all packages within D days\n        def feasible(capacity: int) -> bool:\n            days = 1\n            current_weight = 0\n            for weight in weights:\n                if current_weight + weight > capacity:\n                    days += 1\n                    current_weight = 0\n                current_weight += weight\n            return days <= D\n\n        # Binary search for the minimum capacity\n        left = max(weights)\n        right = sum(weights)\n\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if feasible(mid):\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n\n        return left\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **feasible Function**: This function checks if a given capacity can ship all packages within `D` days. It iterates over the weights, accumulating them until the capacity is exceeded, then starts a new day.\n- **Binary Search**: We perform a binary search between the maximum single package weight and the total weight of all packages. The search narrows down to the minimum capacity that allows shipping within `D` days.",
