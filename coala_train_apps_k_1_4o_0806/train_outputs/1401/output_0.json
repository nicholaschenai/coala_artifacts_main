    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nAnushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a given amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price, and she cannot buy the same chocolate more than once. Given a list of chocolate prices and the total amount of money Anushka has, determine the maximum number of chocolates she can purchase.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo maximize the number of chocolates Anushka can buy, she should start by purchasing the cheapest chocolates first. This way, she can buy as many chocolates as possible before running out of money. The steps to solve this problem are:\n\n1. Sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order.\n2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of chocolates bought and a variable to track the total money spent.\n3. Iterate through the sorted list of prices:\n   - For each price, check if adding this price to the total spent so far is within the budget.\n   - If yes, add the price to the total spent and increment the chocolate counter.\n   - If no, stop the iteration as no more chocolates can be bought without exceeding the budget.\n4. Return the counter as the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n    sort prices in ascending order\n    count = 0\n    total_spent = 0\n    \n    for price in prices:\n        if total_spent + price <= k:\n            total_spent += price\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    return count\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n    # Sort the prices in ascending order\n    prices.sort()\n    \n    # Initialize the count of chocolates and the total money spent\n    count = 0\n    total_spent = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the sorted prices\n    for price in prices:\n        # Check if the current price can be added without exceeding the budget\n        if total_spent + price <= k:\n            total_spent += price  # Add the price to the total spent\n            count += 1  # Increment the count of chocolates\n        else:\n            break  # Stop if the budget is exceeded\n    \n    # Return the maximum number of chocolates that can be bought\n    return count\n```\n\nThis code efficiently calculates the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy by sorting the prices and iterating through them, ensuring that the budget is not exceeded.",
