The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nPikachu is a cute and friendly pok\u00e9mon living in the wild pikachu herd.\n\nBut it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok\u00e9mon! Pok\u00e9mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok\u00e9mon army to resist.\n\nFirst, Andrew counted all the pok\u00e9mon\u00a0\u2014 there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok\u00e9mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.\n\nAs an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \\le b_1 < b_2 < \\dots < b_k \\le n$, and his army will consist of pok\u00e9mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \\dots, a_{b_k}$.\n\nThe strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\dots$.\n\nAndrew is experimenting with pok\u00e9mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok\u00e9mon.\n\nNote: $q=0$ in this version of the task.\n\nAndrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok\u00e9mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.\n\nHelp Andrew and the pok\u00e9mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.\n\nThe first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok\u00e9mon and number of operations respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok\u00e9mon.\n\n$i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$) denoting the indices of pok\u00e9mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n3 0\n1 3 2\n2 0\n1 2\n7 0\n1 2 5 4 3 6 7\n\nOutput\n3\n2\n9\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn third test case we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be $5\u22123+7=9$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.\n\n    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.\n\n    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.\n\n    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select a subsequence that maximizes this sum.\n\n#### Initial Strategy and Mistakes\nInitially, the approach was to sort the array in descending order and calculate the alternating sum by iterating through the entire sorted list. The assumption was that using all elements would yield the maximum sum, which was incorrect. This approach failed because it did not consider that some elements might not contribute positively to the alternating sum.\n\n#### Corrected Strategy\nThe correct strategy involves sorting the array in descending order and then calculating the alternating sum by selectively adding and subtracting elements. The key is to ensure that the sum remains positive and maximized by carefully choosing which elements to include in the subsequence. The solution should only include elements that contribute positively to the alternating sum.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n- Sorting the array in descending order is crucial for maximizing the alternating sum.\n- Not all elements need to be included in the subsequence; only those that contribute positively should be considered.\n- The alternating sum calculation must be carefully managed to ensure that the sum remains maximized.\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem constraints and requirements thoroughly before implementing a solution. It also reinforced the need to consider edge cases where not all elements contribute positively to the desired outcome."

This is insightful because it efficiently calculates the maximum alternating sum by maintaining two states for each Pok\u00e9mon: one where the Pok\u00e9mon is added to the sum and one where it is subtracted.\n\n2. **State Representation**: The DP table `dp[i][0]` represents the maximum alternating sum ending at index `i` with the `i-th` Pok\u00e9mon added, while `dp[i][1]` represents the maximum alternating sum with the `i-th` Pok\u00e9mon subtracted. This dual state representation allows the solution to consider both possibilities at each step.\n\n3. **Transition Logic**: The transitions are defined as:\n   - `dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1] + a[i])`: This means that to have the `i-th` Pok\u00e9mon added, we either continue from the previous state where the last Pok\u00e9mon was also added, or we switch from a state where the last Pok\u00e9mon was subtracted and add the current one.\n   - `dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0] - a[i])`: Similarly, to have the `i-th` Pok\u00e9mon subtracted, we either continue from the previous state where the last Pok\u00e9mon was subtracted, or we switch from a state where the last Pok\u00e9mon was added and subtract the current one.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, which is suitable given the constraints.\n\n#### Why My Approach Failed\n\n- **Incorrect Assumption**: My initial approach incorrectly assumed that we must use all elements in the alternating sum, which is not necessary. The problem allows for any subsequence, and the official solution effectively captures this flexibility using dynamic programming.\n\n- **Lack of State Management**: My solution did not manage different states (adding vs. subtracting) effectively, leading to incorrect results. The official solution's use of a DP table to track these states is a more robust approach.\n\n#### Learning Points\n\n- **Dynamic Programming for Subsequence Problems**: This problem highlights the power of dynamic programming in handling subsequence problems where decisions at each step depend on previous states.\n\n- **State Representation**: Properly representing and transitioning between states is crucial in dynamic programming, especially in problems involving alternating conditions or choices.\n\n- **Efficiency Considerations**: The official solution's O(n) complexity per test case is optimal for the given constraints, demonstrating the importance of choosing efficient algorithms for large input sizes."
