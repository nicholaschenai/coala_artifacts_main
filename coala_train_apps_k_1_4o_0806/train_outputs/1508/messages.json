Each line `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `K-1`) contains `K` digits. The digits in each line are determined by the following rules:\n- If the line number `i` is even, the digits are in increasing order starting from `0` up to `K-1`.\n- If the line number `i` is odd, the digits are in decreasing order starting from `K-1` down to `0`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Read the number of test cases `T`.\n2. For each test case, read the integer `K`.\n3. For each test case, generate `K` lines:\n   - For even-indexed lines, generate a sequence of numbers from `0` to `K-1`.\n   - For odd-indexed lines, generate a sequence of numbers from `K-1` to `0`.\n4.

The subsequent lines are the values of `K` for each test case."

However, the function `find_permutation` is defined but never called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed, leading to no output.\n\n        2. **Permutation Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the permutation is based on starting with a descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This logic seems correct in principle, but it needs to be executed to verify its correctness.\n\n        3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for whether a permutation can achieve the desired sum K is based on comparing K with the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P). This part seems logically sound.\n\n        4. **Execution**: The main issue is that the function is not being executed, which is why no output is being produced.\n\n        To fix the problem, we need to ensure that the function is called and executed properly.

The expected output for each test case should be a block of lines, each line representing a specific pattern. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the pattern generation and the separation between test cases.\n\n### Identifying Mistakes\n\n1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:\n   - Numbers from `i` down to `0`.\n   - Numbers from `0` up to `i`.\n   \n   The current implementation is not correctly generating this pattern.\n\n2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.\n\n### Corrected Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.\n2. **Pattern Generation**:\n   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.\n   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):\n     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.\n     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.\n   - Print the generated pattern for each test case without an extra newline at the end.\n3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline, except after the last test case.\n\n### Corrected Python Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for K in test_cases:\n        pattern = []\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = \"\"\n            # Append numbers from i down to 0\n            for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                line += str(j)\n            # Append numbers from 1 up to i\n            for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                line += str(j)\n            pattern.append(line)\n        results.append(\"\\n\".join(pattern))\n    # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases\n    print(\"\\n\\n\".join(results))\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\ngenerate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Corrected Code\n\n- **Pattern Generation**: The corrected code properly constructs each line by first appending numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.\n- **Output Handling**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and joined with `\\n\\n` to ensure correct separation between test cases without an extra newline at the end. This ensures the output format matches the expected results."

The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. The challenge was to determine if such a permutation exists and to construct it if possible.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P)**: Understanding that f(P) is the sum of the maximums of consecutive pairs in a permutation.\n    - **Feasibility Check**: Calculating the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P) for a given N to quickly determine if a permutation achieving K is possible.\n    - **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which gives the maximum f(P)) and adjusting it to achieve the desired K by swapping elements.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Descending Order Start**: Begin with the permutation in descending order to start with the maximum possible f(P).\n    - **Adjusting the Permutation**: Swap elements to reduce the sum from the maximum possible value to K, ensuring the sum decreases correctly.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the function was defined but not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Efficient I/O Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write` for efficient input and output handling, especially given the constraints on the sum of N across test cases.\n\n    The final solution efficiently checks the feasibility of achieving K and constructs the permutation if possible, handling large inputs and outputs effectively. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and efficient I/O handling in competitive programming.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:\n- Numbers from `i` down to `0`.\n- Numbers from `0` up to `i`.\n\n### Identifying Mistakes\n\n1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:\n   - Numbers from `0` up to `i` for even `i`.\n   - Numbers from `i` down to `0` for odd `i`.\n\n2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.\n\n### Corrected Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.\n2. **Pattern Generation**:\n   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.\n   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):\n     - If `i` is even, create a sequence from `0` to `i`.\n     - If `i` is odd, create a sequence from `i` down to `0`.\n   - Print the generated pattern for each test case without an extra newline at the end.\n3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline, except after the last test case.\n\n### Corrected Python Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for K in test_cases:\n        pattern = []\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = \"\"\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                # Append numbers from 0 to i\n                for j in range(i + 1):\n                    line += str(j)\n            else:\n                # Append numbers from i down to 0\n                for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                    line += str(j)\n            pattern.append(line)\n        results.append(\"\\n\".join(pattern))\n    # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases\n    print(\"\\n\\n\".join(results))\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\ngenerate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Corrected Code\n\n- **Pattern Generation**: The corrected code properly constructs each line by checking if the line index `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, it appends numbers from `0` to `i`. If `i` is odd, it appends numbers from `i` down to `0`.\n- **Output Handling**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and joined with `\\n\\n` to ensure correct separation between test cases without an extra newline at the end.

The description of T test cases follows.\n        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.\n        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - 1 \u2264 T \u2264 40\n        - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file \u2264 106\n        - 0 \u2264 K \u2264 2 * 1010\n\n        -----Example-----\n        Input:\n        3\n        4 12\n        2 2\n        5 14\n\n        Output:\n        -1\n        1 2\n        5 4 3 2 1\n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.\n        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. \n        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:\n\n        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code is designed to read from standard input and write to standard output. However, the function `find_permutation` is defined but never called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed, leading to no output.\n\n        2. **Permutation Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the permutation is based on starting with a descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This logic seems correct in principle, but it needs to be executed to verify its correctness.\n\n        3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for whether a permutation can achieve the desired sum K is based on comparing K with the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P). This part seems logically sound.\n\n        4. **Execution**: The main issue is that the function is not being executed, which is why no output is being produced.\n\n        To fix the problem, we need to ensure that the function is called and executed properly. Let's adjust the code to ensure it runs as expected:\n\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n                min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)\n        \n                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_sum = max_possible\n            \n                    for i in range(N - 1):\n                        if current_sum == K:\n                            break\n                        if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:\n                            current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n            \n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute the logic\n        find_permutation()\n        ```\n\n        ### Key Changes:\n        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.\n        - **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the function processes it as expected.\n        - **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.\n\n        This should address the issue of no output being produced and allow the code to be tested properly.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n                min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)\n        \n                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_sum = max_possible\n            \n                    for i in range(N - 1):\n                        if current_sum == K:\n                            break\n                        if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:\n                            current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n            \n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute the logic\n        find_permutation()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation:\n        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is called at the end to ensure the logic is executed.\n        - **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read` for efficiency with large inputs.\n        - **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.\n        - **Permutation Construction**: The logic constructs a permutation starting from the descending order and adjusts it to achieve the desired sum K, if possible.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['3', '4 12', '2 2', '5 14'] Output: [{'-1'}, {'2', '1'}, {'2', '1', '5', '4', '3'}]\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

This means that the logic inside the function is never executed, leading to no output.\n\n        2. **Permutation Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the permutation is based on starting with a descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This logic seems correct in principle, but it needs to be executed to verify its correctness.\n\n        3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for whether a permutation can achieve the desired sum K is based on comparing K with the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P). This part seems logically sound.\n\n        4. **Execution**: The main issue is that the function is not being executed, which is why no output is being produced.\n\n        To fix the problem, we need to ensure that the function is called and executed properly. Let's adjust the code to ensure it runs as expected:\n\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n                min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)\n        \n                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_sum = max_possible\n            \n                    for i in range(N - 1):\n                        if current_sum == K:\n                            break\n                        if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:\n                            current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n            \n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute the logic\n        find_permutation()\n        ```\n\n        ### Key Changes:\n        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.\n        - **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the function processes it as expected.\n        - **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.\n\n        This should address the issue of no output being produced and allow the code to be tested properly.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n                min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)\n        \n                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_sum = max_possible\n            \n                    for i in range(N - 1):\n                        if current_sum == K:\n                            break\n                        if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:\n                            current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n            \n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute the logic\n        find_permutation()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation:\n        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is called at the end to ensure the logic is executed.\n        - **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read` for efficiency with large inputs.\n        - **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.\n        - **Permutation Construction**: The logic constructs a permutation starting from the descending order and adjusts it to achieve the desired sum K, if possible.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['3', '4 12', '2 2', '5 14'] Output: [{'-1'}, {'2', '1'}, {'2', '1', '5', '4', '3'}]\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

        "content": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Pattern Generation Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem involves generating a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. The pattern for each test case consists of `K` lines, where each line `i` (0-indexed) should display numbers from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `1` up to `i`. This requires understanding how to manipulate loops to generate sequences in both ascending and descending order.\n\n#### Strategies and Errors\nInitially, the logic for generating the pattern was incorrect. The mistake was in the sequence generation, where the numbers were not being appended in the correct order. The expected pattern was misunderstood, leading to incorrect outputs. The key realization was that each line should start with a descending sequence from `i` to `0` and then an ascending sequence from `1` to `i`.\n\nAnother issue was with the output formatting. The solution initially added extra newlines between test cases, which was not required. This was fixed by carefully managing the output to ensure that test cases are separated correctly without trailing newlines.\n\n#### Correct Solution\nThe final solution correctly implements the pattern generation by:\n- Using nested loops to construct each line of the pattern.\n- Ensuring the correct order of numbers for each line.\n- Managing the output format to match the expected results without extra newlines.\n\nHere is the corrected code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for K in test_cases:\n        pattern = []\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = \"\"\n            # Append numbers from i down to 0\n            for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                line += str(j)\n            # Append numbers from 1 up to i\n            for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                line += str(j)\n            pattern.append(line)\n        results.append(\"\\n\".join(pattern))\n    # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases\n    print(\"\\n\\n\".join(results))\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\ngenerate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and carefully managing output formatting in competitive programming problems."

The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.\n\n2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.\n\n3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\nIn future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:\n- Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.\n- Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.\n- Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. \n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation."
