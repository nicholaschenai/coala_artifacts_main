INFO - [Task id] 1508 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to generate a specific pattern based on an integer input `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `K-1`) contains `K` digits. The digits in each line are determined by the following rules:
- If the line number `i` is even, the digits are in increasing order starting from `0` up to `K-1`.
- If the line number `i` is odd, the digits are in decreasing order starting from `K-1` down to `0`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case, read the integer `K`.
3. For each test case, generate `K` lines:
   - For even-indexed lines, generate a sequence of numbers from `0` to `K-1`.
   - For odd-indexed lines, generate a sequence of numbers from `K-1` to `0`.
4. Print the generated pattern for each test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for each K in test_cases:
        for i from 0 to K-1:
            if i is even:
                print numbers from 0 to K-1
            else:
                print numbers from K-1 to 0
```

## Python Solution

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for K in test_cases:
        for i in range(K):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                # Even index: print numbers from 0 to K-1
                line = ''.join(str(x) for x in range(K))
            else:
                # Odd index: print numbers from K-1 to 0
                line = ''.join(str(x) for x in range(K-1, -1, -1))
            print(line)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])

# The following lines are the test cases
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

# Generate and print the pattern for each test case
generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- The function `generate_pattern` takes the number of test cases `T` and a list of integers `test_cases` as input.
- For each test case, it iterates over the range from `0` to `K-1`.
- If the current line index `i` is even, it generates a string of numbers from `0` to `K-1`.
- If the current line index `i` is odd, it generates a string of numbers from `K-1` to `0`.
- The generated line is printed immediately.
- The input is read from standard input, and the first line is the number of test cases. The subsequent lines are the values of `K` for each test case.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
        - 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106
        - 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 1010

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        3
        4 12
        2 2
        5 14

        Output:
        -1
        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code is designed to read from standard input and write to standard output. However, the function `find_permutation` is defined but never called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed, leading to no output.

        2. **Permutation Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the permutation is based on starting with a descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This logic seems correct in principle, but it needs to be executed to verify its correctness.

        3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for whether a permutation can achieve the desired sum K is based on comparing K with the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P). This part seems logically sound.

        4. **Execution**: The main issue is that the function is not being executed, which is why no output is being produced.

        To fix the problem, we need to ensure that the function is called and executed properly. Let's adjust the code to ensure it runs as expected:

        ```python
        def find_permutation():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
                min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)
        
                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                    current_sum = max_possible
            
                    for i in range(N - 1):
                        if current_sum == K:
                            break
                        if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:
                            current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
            
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        # Call the function to execute the logic
        find_permutation()
        ```

        ### Key Changes:
        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the function processes it as expected.
        - **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.

        This should address the issue of no output being produced and allow the code to be tested properly.

        - **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.
        - **Permutation Construction**: The logic constructs a permutation starting from the descending order and adjusts it to achieve the desired sum K, if possible.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to generate a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line `i` (0-indexed) contains a sequence of numbers starting from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `0` up to `i`. The pattern should be printed for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline.

### Pseudocode

```
function generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for each K in test_cases:
        for i from 0 to K-1:
            line = ""
            for j from i down to 0:
                line += str(j)
            for j from 1 to i:
                line += str(j)
            print(line)
        print a newline to separate test cases

read T from input
read test_cases from input
generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for K in test_cases:
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)

data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `K` for each test case.
- **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, we generate `K` lines. Each line is constructed by concatenating numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output**: After generating the pattern for each test case, we print a newline to separate the outputs of different test cases.

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `K` for each test case.
- **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, we generate `K` lines. Each line is constructed by concatenating numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output**: After generating the pattern for each test case, we print a newline to separate the outputs of different test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to generate a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line `i` (0-indexed) contains a sequence of numbers starting from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `0` up to `i`. The pattern should be printed for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline.

### Pseudocode

```
function generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for each K in test_cases:
        for i from 0 to K-1:
            line = ""
            for j from i down to 0:
                line += str(j)
            for j from 1 to i:
                line += str(j)
            print(line)
        print a newline to separate test cases

read T from input
read test_cases from input
generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for K in test_cases:
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)
            print(line)

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is related to the way the pattern is being generated and printed. The expected output for each test case should be a block of lines, each line representing a specific pattern. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the pattern generation and the separation between test cases.

### Identifying Mistakes

1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
   - Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
   - Numbers from `0` up to `i`.
   
   The current implementation is not correctly generating this pattern.

2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case without an extra newline at the end.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline, except after the last test case.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for K in test_cases:
        pattern = []
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)
            pattern.append(line)
        results.append("\n".join(pattern))
    # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases
    print("\n\n".join(results))

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

- **Pattern Generation**: The corrected code properly constructs each line by first appending numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output Handling**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and joined with `\n\n` to ensure correct separation between test cases without an extra newline at the end. This ensures the output format matches the expected results.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function f(P) equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. The challenge was to determine if such a permutation exists and to construct it if possible.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P)**: Understanding that f(P) is the sum of the maximums of consecutive pairs in a permutation.
    - **Feasibility Check**: Calculating the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P) for a given N to quickly determine if a permutation achieving K is possible.
    - **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which gives the maximum f(P)) and adjusting it to achieve the desired K by swapping elements.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Descending Order Start**: Begin with the permutation in descending order to start with the maximum possible f(P).
    - **Adjusting the Permutation**: Swap elements to reduce the sum from the maximum possible value to K, ensuring the sum decreases correctly.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the function was defined but not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Efficient I/O Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write` for efficient input and output handling, especially given the constraints on the sum of N across test cases.

    The final solution efficiently checks the feasibility of achieving K and constructs the permutation if possible, handling large inputs and outputs effectively. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and efficient I/O handling in competitive programming.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to generate a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line `i` (0-indexed) contains a sequence of numbers starting from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `0` up to `i`. The pattern should be printed for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline.

### Pseudocode

```
function generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for each K in test_cases:
        for i from 0 to K-1:
            line = ""
            for j from i down to 0:
                line += str(j)
            for j from 1 to i:
                line += str(j)
            print(line)
        print a newline to separate test cases

read T from input
read test_cases from input
generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for K in test_cases:
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)
            print(line)
        # Print a newline to separate test cases
        print()

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `K` for each test case.
- **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, we generate `K` lines. Each line is constructed by concatenating numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output**: After generating the pattern for each test case, we print a newline to separate the outputs of different test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is related to the way the pattern is being generated and printed. The expected output for each test case should be a block of lines, each line representing a specific pattern. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the pattern generation and the separation between test cases.

### Identifying Mistakes

1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
   - Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
   - Numbers from `0` up to `i`.
   
   The current implementation is not correctly generating this pattern.

2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case without an extra newline at the end.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline, except after the last test case.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for K in test_cases:
        pattern = []
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)
            pattern.append(line)
        results.append("\n".join(pattern))
    # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases
    print("\n\n".join(results))

# Read input

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

- **Pattern Generation**: The corrected code properly constructs each line by first appending numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output Handling**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and joined with `\n\n` to ensure correct separation between test cases without an extra newline at the end. This ensures the output format matches the expected results.

The current solution is not generating the expected pattern correctly. The issue lies in the logic used to construct each line of the pattern. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
- Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
- Numbers from `0` up to `i`.

### Identifying Mistakes

1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
   - Numbers from `0` up to `i` for even `i`.
   - Numbers from `i` down to `0` for odd `i`.

2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - If `i` is even, create a sequence from `0` to `i`.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is related to the way the pattern is being generated and printed. The expected output for each test case should be a block of lines, each line representing a specific pattern. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the pattern generation and the separation between test cases.

### Identifying Mistakes

1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
   - Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
   - Numbers from `0` up to `i`.
   
   The current implementation is not correctly generating this pattern.

2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case without an extra newline at the end.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline, except after the last test case.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for K in test_cases:
        pattern = []
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)
            pattern.append(line)
        results.append("\n".join(pattern))
    # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases
    print("\n\n".join(results))

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

- **Pattern Generation**: The corrected code properly constructs each line by first appending numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output Handling**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and joined with `\n\n` to ensure correct separation between test cases without an extra newline at the end. This ensures the output format matches the expected results.

The current solution is not generating the expected pattern correctly. The issue lies in the logic used to construct each line of the pattern. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:

Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
        - 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106
        - 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 1010

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        3
        4 12
        2 2
        5 14

        Output:
        -1
        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code is designed to read from standard input and write to standard output. However, the function `find_permutation` is defined but never called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed, leading to no output.

        2. **Permutation Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the permutation is based on starting with a descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This logic seems correct in principle, but it needs to be executed to verify its correctness.

        3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for whether a permutation can achieve the desired sum K is based on comparing K with the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P). This part seems logically sound.

        4. **Execution**: The main issue is that the function is not being executed, which is why no output is being produced.

        To fix the problem, we need to ensure that the function is called and executed properly. Let's adjust the code to ensure it runs as expected:

        ```python
        def find_permutation():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
                min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)
        
                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                    current_sum = max_possible
            
                    for i in range(N - 1):
                        if current_sum == K:
                            break
                        if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:
                            current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
            
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        # Call the function to execute the logic
        find_permutation()
        ```

        ### Key Changes:
        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the function processes it as expected.
        - **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.

        This should address the issue of no output being produced and allow the code to be tested properly.

        # Call the function to execute the logic
        find_permutation()
        ```

        ### Explanation:
        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is called at the end to ensure the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read` for efficiency with large inputs.
        - **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.
        - **Permutation Construction**: The logic constructs a permutation starting from the descending order and adjusts it to achieve the desired sum K, if possible.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to generate a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line `i` (0-indexed) contains a sequence of numbers starting from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `0` up to `i`. The pattern should be printed for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline.

### Pseudocode

```
function generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for each K in test_cases:
        for i from 0 to K-1:
            line = ""
            for j from i down to 0:
                line += str(j)
            for j from 1 to i:
                line += str(j)
            print(line)
        print a newline to separate test cases

read T from input
read test_cases from input
generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for K in test_cases:
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)
            print(line)
        # Print a newline to separate test cases
        print()

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `K` for each test case.
- **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, we generate `K` lines. Each line is constructed by concatenating numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output**: After generating the pattern for each test case, we print a newline to separate the outputs of different test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is related to the way the pattern is being generated and printed. The expected output for each test case should be a block of lines, each line representing a specific pattern. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the pattern generation and the separation between test cases.

### Identifying Mistakes

1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
   - Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
   - Numbers from `0` up to `i`.
   
   The current implementation is not correctly generating this pattern.

2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case without an extra newline at the end.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline, except after the last test case.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for K in test_cases:
        pattern = []
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)
            pattern.append(line)
        results.append("\n".join(pattern))
    # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases
    print("\n\n".join(results))

# Read input

data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

- **Pattern Generation**: The corrected code properly constructs each line by first appending numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output Handling**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and joined with `\n\n` to ensure correct separation between test cases without an extra newline at the end. This ensures the output format matches the expected results.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to generate a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line `i` (0-indexed) contains a sequence of numbers starting from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `0` up to `i`. The pattern should be printed for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline.

### Pseudocode

data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `K` for each test case.
- **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, we generate `K` lines. Each line is constructed by concatenating numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output**: After generating the pattern for each test case, we print a newline to separate the outputs of different test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is related to the way the pattern is being generated and printed. The expected output for each test case should be a block of lines, each line representing a specific pattern. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the pattern generation and the separation between test cases.

### Identifying Mistakes

1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
   - Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
   - Numbers from `0` up to `i`.
   
   The current implementation is not correctly generating this pattern.

2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case without an extra newline at the end.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline, except after the last test case.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for K in test_cases:
        pattern = []
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)
            pattern.append(line)
        results.append("\n".join(pattern))
    # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases
    print("\n\n".join(results))

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

- **Pattern Generation**: The corrected code properly constructs each line by first appending numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output Handling**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and joined with `\n\n` to ensure correct separation between test cases without an extra newline at the end. This ensures the output format matches the expected results.

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
        - 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106
        - 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 1010

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        3
        4 12
        2 2
        5 14

        Output:
        -1
        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code is designed to read from standard input and write to standard output. However, the function `find_permutation` is defined but never called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed, leading to no output.

        2. **Permutation Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the permutation is based on starting with a descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This logic seems correct in principle, but it needs to be executed to verify its correctness.

        3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for whether a permutation can achieve the desired sum K is based on comparing K with the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P). This part seems logically sound.

        4. **Execution**: The main issue is that the function is not being executed, which is why no output is being produced.

        To fix the problem, we need to ensure that the function is called and executed properly. Let's adjust the code to ensure it runs as expected:

        ```python
        def find_permutation():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
                min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)
        
                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                    current_sum = max_possible
            
                    for i in range(N - 1):
                        if current_sum == K:
                            break
                        if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:
                            current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
            
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        # Call the function to execute the logic
        find_permutation()
        ```

        ### Key Changes:
        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the function processes it as expected.
        - **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.

        This should address the issue of no output being produced and allow the code to be tested properly.

        # Call the function to execute the logic
        find_permutation()
        ```

        ### Explanation:
        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is called at the end to ensure the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read` for efficiency with large inputs.
        - **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.
        - **Permutation Construction**: The logic constructs a permutation starting from the descending order and adjusts it to achieve the desired sum K, if possible.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [generation text] Let's address the issue with the pattern generation logic. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
- Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
- Followed by numbers from `0` up to `i-1`.

Let's correct the code to reflect this logic:

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for K in test_cases:
        pattern = []
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

- **Pattern Generation**: The code constructs each line by first appending numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`. This matches the expected pattern.
- **Output Handling**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and joined with `\n\n` to ensure correct separation between test cases without an extra newline at the end. This ensures the output format matches the expected results.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to generate a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line `i` (0-indexed) contains a sequence of numbers starting from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `0` up to `i`. The pattern should be printed for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline.

### Pseudocode

```
function generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for each K in test_cases:
        for i from 0 to K-1:
            line = ""
            for j from i down to 0:
                line += str(j)
            for j from 1 to i:
                line += str(j)
            print(line)
        print a newline to separate test cases

read T from input
read test_cases from input
generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for K in test_cases:
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)
            print(line)
        # Print a newline to separate test cases
        print()

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `K` for each test case.
- **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, we generate `K` lines. Each line is constructed by concatenating numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output**: After generating the pattern for each test case, we print a newline to separate the outputs of different test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is related to the way the pattern is being generated and printed. The expected output for each test case should be a block of lines, each line representing a specific pattern. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the pattern generation and the separation between test cases.

### Identifying Mistakes

1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
   - Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
   - Numbers from `0` up to `i`.
   
   The current implementation is not correctly generating this pattern.

2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case without an extra newline at the end.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline, except after the last test case.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for K in test_cases:
        pattern = []

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The current solution is not generating the expected pattern correctly. The issue lies in the logic used to construct each line of the pattern. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
- Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
- Numbers from `0` up to `i`.

### Identifying Mistakes

1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
   - Numbers from `0` up to `i` for even `i`.
   - Numbers from `i` down to `0` for odd `i`.

2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

- **Pattern Generation**: The corrected code properly constructs each line by checking if the line index `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, it appends numbers from `0` to `i`. If `i` is odd, it appends numbers from `i` down to `0`.
- **Output Handling**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and joined with `\n\n` to ensure correct separation between test cases without an extra newline at the end. This ensures the output format matches the expected results.

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

- **Pattern Generation**: The corrected code properly constructs each line by checking if the line index `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, it appends numbers from `0` to `i`. If `i` is odd, it appends numbers from `i` down to `0`.
- **Output Handling**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and joined with `\n\n` to ensure correct separation between test cases without an extra newline at the end. This ensures the output format matches the expected results.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The current solution is not generating the expected pattern correctly. The issue lies in the logic used to construct each line of the pattern. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
- For even `i`, numbers from `0` to `i`.
- For odd `i`, numbers from `i` down to `0`.

However, the expected output is actually:
- For line `i`, numbers from `i` down to `0`.
- Followed by numbers from `0` up to `i-1`.

### Identifying Mistakes

1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
   - Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
   - Followed by numbers from `0` up to `i-1`.

2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i-1`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case without an extra newline at the end.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline, except after the last test case.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for K in test_cases:

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Pattern Generation Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem involves generating a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. The pattern for each test case consists of `K` lines, where each line `i` (0-indexed) should display numbers from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `1` up to `i`. This requires understanding how to manipulate loops to generate sequences in both ascending and descending order.

#### Strategies and Errors
Initially, the logic for generating the pattern was incorrect. The mistake was in the sequence generation, where the numbers were not being appended in the correct order. The expected pattern was misunderstood, leading to incorrect outputs. The key realization was that each line should start with a descending sequence from `i` to `0` and then an ascending sequence from `1` to `i`.

Another issue was with the output formatting. The solution initially added extra newlines between test cases, which was not required. This was fixed by carefully managing the output to ensure that test cases are separated correctly without trailing newlines.

#### Correct Solution
The final solution correctly implements the pattern generation by:
- Using nested loops to construct each line of the pattern.
- Ensuring the correct order of numbers for each line.
- Managing the output format to match the expected results without extra newlines.

Here is the corrected code snippet:

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for K in test_cases:
        pattern = []
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)
            pattern.append(line)
        results.append("\n".join(pattern))
    # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases
    print("\n\n".join(results))

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to generate a specific pattern based on an integer `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line `i` (0-indexed) contains a sequence of numbers starting from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `0` up to `i`. The pattern should be printed for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline.

### Pseudocode

```
function generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for each K in test_cases:
        for i from 0 to K-1:
            line = ""
            for j from i down to 0:
                line += str(j)
            for j from 1 to i:
                line += str(j)
            print(line)
        print a newline to separate test cases

read T from input
read test_cases from input
generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    for K in test_cases:
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                line += str(j)
            print(line)
        # Print a newline to separate test cases
        print()

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `K` for each test case.
- **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, we generate `K` lines. Each line is constructed by concatenating numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.
- **Output**: After generating the pattern for each test case, we print a newline to separate the outputs of different test cases.

The issue with the current solution is related to the way the pattern is being generated and printed. The expected output for each test case should be a block of lines, each line representing a specific pattern. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the pattern generation and the separation between test cases.

### Identifying Mistakes

1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
   - Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
   - Numbers from `0` up to `i`.

- **Pattern Generation**: The corrected code properly constructs each line by checking if the line index `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, it appends numbers from `0` to `i`. If `i` is odd, it appends numbers from `i` down to `0`.
- **Output Handling**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and joined with `\n\n` to ensure correct separation between test cases without an extra newline at the end. This ensures the output format matches the expected results.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The current solution is not generating the expected pattern correctly. The issue lies in the logic used to construct each line of the pattern. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
- For even `i`, numbers from `0` to `i`.
- For odd `i`, numbers from `i` down to `0`.

However, the expected output is actually:
- For line `i`, numbers from `i` down to `0`.
- Followed by numbers from `0` up to `i-1`.

### Identifying Mistakes

1. **Pattern Generation**: The logic for generating each line of the pattern is incorrect. The expected pattern for each line `i` should be:
   - Numbers from `i` down to `0`.
   - Followed by numbers from `0` up to `i-1`.

2. **Output Separation**: The current implementation adds an extra newline after each test case, which is not required. The expected output should not have an extra newline after the last test case.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases `T` and then read each integer `K` for the test cases.
2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - For each test case with integer `K`, generate `K` lines.
   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):
     - Create a sequence from `i` down to `0`.
     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i-1`.
   - Print the generated pattern for each test case without an extra newline at the end.
3. **Output**: Print the pattern for each test case, ensuring each test case's pattern is separated by a newline, except after the last test case.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for K in test_cases:
        pattern = []
        for i in range(K):
            line = ""
            # Append numbers from i down to 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                line += str(j)
            # Append numbers from 1 up to i
            for j in range(1, i):
                line += str(j)
            pattern.append(line)
        results.append("\n".join(pattern))
    # Print all results, separated by a newline between test cases
    print("\n\n".join(results))

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
```

T = int(data[0])

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1508 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this pattern generation task, I encountered a few key insights:

1. **Pattern Understanding**: The main challenge was correctly understanding the pattern generation logic. The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.

2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.

3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.

In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:
- Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.
- Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.
- Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. 

This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.
