## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If any two beds are adjacent in any of these directions, the arrangement is "UNSAFE". We need to perform this check for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each test case, read the grid dimensions \( N \) and the grid itself.
2. For each cell in the grid that contains a bed (value 1), check its adjacent cells in all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).
3. If any adjacent cell also contains a bed, mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE" and break out of the loop for that test case.
4. If no adjacent beds are found for any bed in the grid, mark the arrangement as "SAFE".
5. Repeat the above steps for all test cases and output the result for each.

## Pseudocode

```
function check_safety(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (di, dj) in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)]:
                ni = i + di
                nj = j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read grid of size N x N
        result = check_safety(grid, N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_safety(grid, N):
    # Directions for adjacent cells: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all adjacent cells
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = check_safety(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the bed arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", and outputs the result for each test case. The `check_safety` function checks all possible adjacent positions for each bed to ensure no two beds are adjacent.

Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        -----Sample Input-----
        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the code and the feedback to identify the issue:

        ### Problem Analysis

        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from or writing to standard IO. This is a common problem when the function `solve()` is defined but not called, or when the input/output is not handled correctly.

        2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be called explicitly to execute the logic.

        3. **Output**: The output is expected to be printed, but the feedback indicates that no output was detected. This suggests that the function might not be executed at all.

        ### Steps to Fix

        1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the logic is executed.

        2. **Check Input/Output**: Verify that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

        3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Although the logic seems correct, ensure that the binary search and set operations are functioning as intended.

        ### Revised Code

        Let's make sure the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly:

        ```python
        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
    
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                index += 1
                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
                index += N
                Q = int(data[index])
                index += 1
        
                a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall
        
                for _ in range(Q):
                    x_j = int(data[index])
                    y_j = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
                    if sum_xy in a_set:
                        results.append(-1)
                    else:
                        # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                        low, high = 0, N
                        while low < high:
                            mid = (low + high) // 2
                            if a[mid] > sum_xy:
                                high = mid
                            else:
                                low = mid + 1
                        results.append(N - low)
    
            sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

        # Call the solve function to execute the logic
        solve()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
        - **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.
        - **Logic**: The logic remains the same, using a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A "SAFE" arrangement means no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, except for consecutive diagonal blocks. We need to check this condition for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) also contains a bed, except for the allowed consecutive diagonal blocks.

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if the arrangement meets the criteria, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            check all adjacent cells (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)
            check diagonal cells (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j+1)
            if any of these cells contain a bed (1), return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function solve():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print result
```

 ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A "SAFE" arrangement means no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, except for consecutive diagonal blocks. We need to check this condition for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) also contains a bed, except for the allowed consecutive diagonal blocks.

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if the arrangement meets the criteria, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the `solve()` function, which contains the logic to read input and produce output, is not being called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the `solve()` function should be executed to process the input and generate the output. However, in this case, the function is defined but never invoked, leading to no output being produced.

## Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Call the `solve()` Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Review Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly from standard input and that the data is being parsed and processed as expected.

3. **Output the Results**: Make sure that the results are printed to standard output as required by the problem statement.

## Revised Solution

The main change is to call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check horizontal and vertical neighbors
                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and grid[i+1][j] == 1:

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A "SAFE" arrangement means no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, except for consecutive diagonal blocks. We need to check this condition for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) also contains a bed, except for the allowed consecutive diagonal blocks.

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if the arrangement meets the criteria, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            check all adjacent cells (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)
            check diagonal cells (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j+1)
            if any of these cells contain a bed (1), return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function solve():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the `solve()` function, which contains the logic to read input and produce output, is not being called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the `solve()` function should be executed to process the input and generate the output. However, in this case, the function is defined but never invoked, leading to no output being produced.

## Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Call the `solve()` Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Review Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly from standard input and that the data is being parsed and processed as expected.

3. **Output the Results**: Make sure that the results are printed to standard output as required by the problem statement.

## Revised Solution

The main change is to call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check horizontal and vertical neighbors
                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and grid[i+1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j < N-1 and grid[i][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                # Check diagonal neighbors
                if i > 0 and j > 0 and grid[i-1][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i > 0 and j < N-1 and grid[i-1][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and j > 0 and grid[i+1][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and j < N-1 and grid[i+1][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

This code should now correctly read the input, process each test case, and print the results as expected.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns

    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days, where each day features a different dish from a set of four options. The constraints are that consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last days must also differ. The challenge is to compute the number of such valid schedules efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    #### Strategies and Errors

    1. **Initial Approach**: The initial approach used a formula \( 4 \times 3^{(N-1)} \), which incorrectly assumed that the last day had 3 choices. This led to incorrect results for \( N > 2 \).

    2. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula is \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \). This accounts for:
       - 4 choices for the first day.
       - \( 3^{(N-2)} \) choices for the intermediate days.
       - 2 choices for the last day, ensuring it differs from both the previous day and the first day.

    3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using Python's `pow` function with three arguments allows efficient computation of large powers under a modulus, which is crucial for handling large \( N \).

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes

    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by adding a call to `main()` within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
    - **Formula Miscalculation**: The initial miscalculation of the formula was corrected by re-evaluating the constraints and adjusting the formula to \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \).

    ### Final Correct Code

    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return (4 * 3) % MOD
        else:
            # Using modular exponentiation to compute 3^(N-2) % MOD
            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)
            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    # Call the main function to execute the program
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering problem constraints and verifying the logic of mathematical formulas used in algorithmic solutions.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A "SAFE" arrangement means no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, except for consecutive diagonal blocks. We need to check this condition for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) also contains a bed, except for the allowed consecutive diagonal blocks.

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if the arrangement meets the criteria, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            check all adjacent cells (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)
            check diagonal cells (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j+1)
            if any of these cells contain a bed (1), return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function solve():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the `solve()` function, which contains the logic to read input and produce output, is not being called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the `solve()` function should be executed to process the input and generate the output. However, in this case, the function is defined but never invoked, leading to no output being produced.

## Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Call the `solve()` Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Review Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly from standard input and that the data is being parsed and processed as expected.

3. **Output the Results**: Make sure that the results are printed to standard output as required by the problem statement.

## Revised Solution

The main change is to call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check horizontal and vertical neighbors
                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and grid[i+1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j < N-1 and grid[i][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                # Check diagonal neighbors
                if i > 0 and j > 0 and grid[i-1][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i > 0 and j < N-1 and grid[i-1][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and j > 0 and grid[i+1][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and j < N-1 and grid[i+1][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] ## Analysis of the Problem

The current solution incorrectly marks some test cases as "UNSAFE" because it checks all adjacent cells, including diagonals, for the presence of a bed. However, the problem statement allows beds to be placed on consecutive diagonal blocks, which means that diagonal adjacency is permitted and should not be considered unsafe.

## Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The problem allows beds to be placed on consecutive diagonal blocks. This means that diagonal adjacency is not considered unsafe.

2. **Adjust the Safety Check**: Modify the `is_safe` function to only check horizontal and vertical neighbors for adjacency. Diagonal checks should be removed or adjusted to allow consecutive diagonal blocks.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly identifies "SAFE" and "UNSAFE" configurations based on the updated understanding of the problem.

## Revised Solution

The main change is to remove the diagonal checks from the `is_safe` function. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check horizontal and vertical neighbors only
                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and grid[i+1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j < N-1 and grid[i][j+1] == 1:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A "SAFE" arrangement means no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, except for consecutive diagonal blocks. We need to check this condition for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) also contains a bed, except for the allowed consecutive diagonal blocks.

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if the arrangement meets the criteria, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            check all adjacent cells (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)
            check diagonal cells (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j+1)
            if any of these cells contain a bed (1), return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function solve():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:

                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1:

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the `solve()` function, which contains the logic to read input and produce output, is not being called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the `solve()` function should be executed to process the input and generate the output. However, in this case, the function is defined but never invoked, leading to no output being produced.

## Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Call the `solve()` Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Review Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly from standard input and that the data is being parsed and processed as expected.

3. **Output the Results**: Make sure that the results are printed to standard output as required by the problem statement.

## Revised Solution

The main change is to call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check horizontal and vertical neighbors
                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and grid[i+1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j < N-1 and grid[i][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                # Check diagonal neighbors
                if i > 0 and j > 0 and grid[i-1][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i > 0 and j < N-1 and grid[i-1][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and j > 0 and grid[i+1][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and j < N-1 and grid[i+1][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

This code should now correctly read the input, process each test case, and print the results as expected.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The current solution incorrectly marks some test cases as "UNSAFE" because it checks all adjacent cells, including diagonals, for the presence of a bed. However, the problem statement allows beds to be placed on consecutive diagonal blocks, which means that diagonal adjacency is permitted and should not be considered unsafe.

## Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The problem allows beds to be placed on consecutive diagonal blocks. This means that diagonal adjacency is not considered unsafe.

2. **Adjust the Safety Check**: Modify the `is_safe` function to only check horizontal and vertical neighbors for adjacency. Diagonal checks should be removed or adjusted to allow consecutive diagonal blocks.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly identifies "SAFE" and "UNSAFE" configurations based on the updated understanding of the problem.

## Revised Solution

The main change is to remove the diagonal checks from the `is_safe` function. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns

    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days, where each day features a different dish from a set of four options. The constraints are that consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last days must also differ. The challenge is to compute the number of such valid schedules efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    #### Strategies and Errors

    1. **Initial Approach**: The initial approach used a formula \( 4 \times 3^{(N-1)} \), which incorrectly assumed that the last day had 3 choices. This led to incorrect results for \( N > 2 \).

    2. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula is \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \). This accounts for:
       - 4 choices for the first day.
       - \( 3^{(N-2)} \) choices for the intermediate days.
       - 2 choices for the last day, ensuring it differs from both the previous day and the first day.

    3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using Python's `pow` function with three arguments allows efficient computation of large powers under a modulus, which is crucial for handling large \( N \).

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes

    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by adding a call to `main()` within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
    - **Formula Miscalculation**: The initial miscalculation of the formula was corrected by re-evaluating the constraints and adjusting the formula to \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \).

    ### Final Correct Code

    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return (4 * 3) % MOD
        else:
            # Using modular exponentiation to compute 3^(N-2) % MOD
            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)
            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    # Call the main function to execute the program
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering problem constraints and verifying the logic of mathematical formulas used in algorithmic solutions.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A "SAFE" arrangement means no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, except for consecutive diagonal blocks. We need to check this condition for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) also contains a bed, except for the allowed consecutive diagonal blocks.

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if the arrangement meets the criteria, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            check all adjacent cells (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)
            check diagonal cells (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j+1)
            if any of these cells contain a bed (1), return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function solve():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:

                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1:

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the `solve()` function, which contains the logic to read input and produce output, is not being called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the `solve()` function should be executed to process the input and generate the output. However, in this case, the function is defined but never invoked, leading to no output being produced.

## Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Call the `solve()` Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Review Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly from standard input and that the data is being parsed and processed as expected.

3. **Output the Results**: Make sure that the results are printed to standard output as required by the problem statement.

## Revised Solution

The main change is to call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check horizontal and vertical neighbors
                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and grid[i+1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j < N-1 and grid[i][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                # Check diagonal neighbors
                if i > 0 and j > 0 and grid[i-1][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i > 0 and j < N-1 and grid[i-1][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and j > 0 and grid[i+1][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and j < N-1 and grid[i+1][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

This code should now correctly read the input, process each test case, and print the results as expected.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The current solution incorrectly marks some test cases as "UNSAFE" because it checks all adjacent cells, including diagonals, for the presence of a bed. However, the problem statement allows beds to be placed on consecutive diagonal blocks, which means that diagonal adjacency is permitted and should not be considered unsafe.

## Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The problem allows beds to be placed on consecutive diagonal blocks. This means that diagonal adjacency is not considered unsafe.

2. **Adjust the Safety Check**: Modify the `is_safe` function to only check horizontal and vertical neighbors for adjacency. Diagonal checks should be removed or adjusted to allow consecutive diagonal blocks.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly identifies "SAFE" and "UNSAFE" configurations based on the updated understanding of the problem.

## Revised Solution

The main change is to remove the diagonal checks from the `is_safe` function. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check horizontal and vertical neighbors only
                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if i < N-1 and grid[i+1][j] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
                if j < N-1 and grid[i][j+1] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

This code should now correctly identify "SAFE" and "UNSAFE" configurations by only considering horizontal and vertical adjacency, as diagonal adjacency is allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine if a grid of beds was arranged safely according to specific adjacency rules. The key concept was understanding that beds could be adjacent diagonally but not horizontally or vertically. Initially, the solution incorrectly considered diagonal adjacency as unsafe, leading to incorrect results.

The main strategy that worked was to focus only on horizontal and vertical adjacency checks, as diagonal adjacency is allowed. This required a careful review of the problem statement to ensure the correct interpretation of the rules.

An unexpected error was the initial failure to call the `solve()` function, which resulted in no output. This was a simple oversight but highlighted the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed in a script.

The final solution involved removing unnecessary diagonal checks and ensuring the function was called to process input and output results. This experience reinforced the importance of thoroughly understanding problem constraints and ensuring that the solution logic aligns with those constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$

0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A "SAFE" arrangement means no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, except for consecutive diagonal blocks. We need to check this condition for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) of the grid and then the \( N \times N \) grid itself.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) also contains a bed, except for the allowed consecutive diagonal blocks.

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if the arrangement meets the criteria, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            check all adjacent cells (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)
            check diagonal cells (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j+1)
            if any of these cells contain a bed (1), return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function solve():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the `solve()` function, which contains the logic to read input and produce output, is not being called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the `solve()` function should be executed to process the input and generate the output. However, in this case, the function is defined but never invoked, leading to no output being produced.

## Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Call the `solve()` Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Review Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly from standard input and that the data is being parsed and processed as expected.

3. **Output the Results**: Make sure that the results are printed to standard output as required by the problem statement.

## Revised Solution

The main change is to call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The current solution incorrectly marks some test cases as "UNSAFE" because it checks all adjacent cells, including diagonals, for the presence of a bed. However, the problem statement allows beds to be placed on consecutive diagonal blocks, which means that diagonal adjacency is permitted and should not be considered unsafe.

## Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The problem allows beds to be placed on consecutive diagonal blocks. This means that diagonal adjacency is not considered unsafe.

2. **Adjust the Safety Check**: Modify the `is_safe` function to only check horizontal and vertical neighbors for adjacency. Diagonal checks should be removed or adjusted to allow consecutive diagonal blocks.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly identifies "SAFE" and "UNSAFE" configurations based on the updated understanding of the problem.

## Revised Solution

The main change is to remove the diagonal checks from the `is_safe` function. Here is the corrected code:

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] In this problem, the key insight was understanding the specific adjacency rules for beds in the grid. The problem allows beds to be placed on consecutive diagonal blocks, which means that diagonal adjacency is not considered unsafe. My initial approach incorrectly included diagonal checks, which led to incorrect results.

The official solution focuses on checking only horizontal and vertical adjacency, which aligns with the problem's requirements. It uses a straightforward approach by iterating through the grid and checking each row and column for consecutive beds. If any such adjacency is found, it immediately marks the configuration as "UNSAFE" and breaks out of the loop. This approach is efficient and directly addresses the problem constraints.

Reflecting on this, the main takeaway is the importance of thoroughly understanding problem constraints and ensuring that the solution logic aligns with them. Additionally, the official solution's use of flags to break out of loops early is a useful technique to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary checks once an unsafe condition is detected. This experience reinforces the need to carefully parse problem statements and adjust logic accordingly to meet specific requirements.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes multiple test cases, each with a grid size and the grid itself. It processes each test case by constructing a grid of integers and then checks if the grid is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" using a helper function. The safety check involves ensuring that no two adjacent cells in the grid contain the value 1. The results for each test case are collected and printed sequentially.

[Problem]
    Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
    The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
    The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
    This is a SAFE example:
    1 0
    0 1
    This is an UNSAFE example:
    0 1 1
    0 0 0
    1 0 0
    To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
    Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Next line contains $N$.
    - Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
    - $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
    - $2 \leq N \leq 100$

    -----Subtasks-----
    - 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
    - 70 points : Original constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    4
    1 0 1 0
    0 0 0 1
    0 1 0 0
    1 0 0 1
    4
    1 0 1 0
    0 0 0 0
    1 0 1 1
    0 1 0 0

    -----Sample Output:-----
    SAFE
    UNSAFE

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.
