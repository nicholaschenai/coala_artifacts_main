The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.\nThe area is of dimension $N$ x $N$\nThe whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.\nThis is a SAFE example:\n1 0\n0 1\nThis is an UNSAFE example:\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nTo avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.\nReturn an output of \"SAFE\" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return \"UNSAFE\" otherwise.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Next line contains $N$.\n- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as \"UNSAFE\".\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n- $0 \\leq Ai \\leq 1$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 100$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- 30 points : $1 \\leq N \\leq 7$\n- 70 points : Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n4\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n4\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\nSAFE\nUNSAFE\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nBeds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a grid of size \\( N \\times N \\) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\". An arrangement is considered \"SAFE\" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If any two beds are adjacent in any of these directions, the arrangement is \"UNSAFE\". We need to perform this check for multiple test cases.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. For each test case, read the grid dimensions \\( N \\) and the grid itself.\n2. For each cell in the grid that contains a bed (value 1), check its adjacent cells in all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).\n3. If any adjacent cell also contains a bed, mark the arrangement as \"UNSAFE\" and break out of the loop for that test case.\n4. If no adjacent beds are found for any bed in the grid, mark the arrangement as \"SAFE\".\n5. Repeat the above steps for all test cases and output the result for each.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction check_safety(grid, N):\n    for each cell (i, j) in grid:\n        if grid[i][j] == 1:\n            for each direction (di, dj) in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)]:\n                ni = i + di\n                nj = j + dj\n                if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:\n                    return \"UNSAFE\"\n    return \"SAFE\"\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read N\n        read grid of size N x N\n        result = check_safety(grid, N)\n        print result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_safety(grid, N):\n    # Directions for adjacent cells: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]\n    \n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Check all adjacent cells\n                for di, dj in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:\n                        return \"UNSAFE\"\n    return \"SAFE\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(N):\n            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            grid.append(row)\n        \n        result = check_safety(grid, N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the bed arrangement is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\", and outputs the result for each test case. The `check_safety` function checks all possible adjacent positions for each bed to ensure no two beds are adjacent."

But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.\n        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.\n        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.\n        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.\n        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.\n        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line.

This is a common problem when the function `solve()` is defined but not called, or when the input/output is not handled correctly.\n\n        2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be called explicitly to execute the logic.\n\n        3. **Output**: The output is expected to be printed, but the feedback indicates that no output was detected. This suggests that the function might not be executed at all.\n\n        ### Steps to Fix\n\n        1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the logic is executed.\n\n        2. **Check Input/Output**: Verify that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.\n\n        3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Although the logic seems correct, ensure that the binary search and set operations are functioning as intended.\n\n        ### Revised Code\n\n        Let's make sure the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly:\n\n        ```python\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n    \n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                Q = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n        \n                a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    x_j = int(data[index])\n                    y_j = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                    if sum_xy in a_set:\n                        results.append(-1)\n                    else:\n                        # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                        low, high = 0, N\n                        while low < high:\n                            mid = (low + high) // 2\n                            if a[mid] > sum_xy:\n                                high = mid\n                            else:\n                                low = mid + 1\n                        results.append(N - low)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.\n        - **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.\n        - **Logic**: The logic remains the same, using a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n    \n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                Q = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n        \n                a_set = set(a)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    x_j = int(data[index])\n                    y_j = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                    if sum_xy in a_set:\n                        results.append(-1)\n                    else:\n                        # Binary search to find how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                        low, high = 0, N\n                        while low < high:\n                            mid = (low + high) // 2\n                            if a[mid] > sum_xy:\n                                high = mid\n                            else:\n                                low = mid + 1\n                        results.append(N - low)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the logic\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.\n        - **Input/Output**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is typical in competitive programming to handle large input/output efficiently.\n        - **Logic**: The logic uses a set to check if Chef starts on a wall and binary search to count the walls Chef needs to break.

However, in this case, the function is defined but never invoked, leading to no output being produced.\n\n## Steps to Fix the Code\n\n1. **Call the `solve()` Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.\n\n2. **Review Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly from standard input and that the data is being parsed and processed as expected.\n\n3. **Output the Results**: Make sure that the results are printed to standard output as required by the problem statement.\n\n## Revised Solution\n\nThe main change is to call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.

The constraints are that consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last days must also differ. The challenge is to compute the number of such valid schedules efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    1. **Initial Approach**: The initial approach used a formula \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-1)} \\), which incorrectly assumed that the last day had 3 choices. This led to incorrect results for \\( N > 2 \\).\n\n    2. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula is \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\). This accounts for:\n       - 4 choices for the first day.\n       - \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) choices for the intermediate days.\n       - 2 choices for the last day, ensuring it differs from both the previous day and the first day.\n\n    3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using Python's `pow` function with three arguments allows efficient computation of large powers under a modulus, which is crucial for handling large \\( N \\).\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by adding a call to `main()` within the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block.\n    - **Formula Miscalculation**: The initial miscalculation of the formula was corrected by re-evaluating the constraints and adjusting the formula to \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\).\n\n    ### Final Correct Code\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return (4 * 3) % MOD\n        else:\n            # Using modular exponentiation to compute 3^(N-2) % MOD\n            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)\n            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = calculate_schedules(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    # Call the main function to execute the program\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering problem constraints and verifying the logic of mathematical formulas used in algorithmic solutions.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The problem allows beds to be placed on consecutive diagonal blocks, which means that diagonal adjacency is not considered unsafe. My initial approach incorrectly included diagonal checks, which led to incorrect results.\n\nThe official solution focuses on checking only horizontal and vertical adjacency, which aligns with the problem's requirements. It uses a straightforward approach by iterating through the grid and checking each row and column for consecutive beds. If any such adjacency is found, it immediately marks the configuration as \"UNSAFE\" and breaks out of the loop. This approach is efficient and directly addresses the problem constraints.\n\nReflecting on this, the main takeaway is the importance of thoroughly understanding problem constraints and ensuring that the solution logic aligns with them. Additionally, the official solution's use of flags to break out of loops early is a useful technique to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary checks once an unsafe condition is detected.
