    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays (subsequences of consecutive elements) in `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. \n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify the positions of odd numbers in the array. This will help us in determining the subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.\n\n2. **Use Two Pointers**: We can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. The idea is to maintain a window that contains exactly `k` odd numbers and count the number of such windows.\n\n3. **Count Subarrays**: For each valid window (subarray) that contains exactly `k` odd numbers, we can extend the window to the left and right to count all possible subarrays that still contain exactly `k` odd numbers.\n\n4. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the array, adjusting the window size using the two pointers, and count the number of valid subarrays.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start of the array.\n2. Initialize a counter `odd_count` to count the number of odd numbers in the current window.\n3. Initialize a variable `result` to store the number of nice subarrays.\n4. Iterate `right` over the array:\n   - If `nums[right]` is odd, increment `odd_count`.\n   - While `odd_count` is greater than `k`, increment `left` and decrement `odd_count` if `nums[left]` is odd.\n   - If `odd_count` equals `k`, count the number of subarrays ending at `right` with exactly `k` odd numbers.\n5. Return `result`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        def count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k):\n            left = 0\n            odd_count = 0\n            result = 0\n            for right in range(len(nums)):\n                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:\n                    odd_count += 1\n                while odd_count > k:\n                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:\n                        odd_count -= 1\n                    left += 1\n                result += right - left + 1\n            return result\n        \n        # The number of subarrays with exactly k odd numbers is the difference\n        # between the number of subarrays with at most k odd numbers and the\n        # number of subarrays with at most k-1 odd numbers.\n        return count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k) - count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k - 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- The function `count_at_most_k_odd` calculates the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers using a sliding window approach.\n- The main function `numberOfSubarrays` calculates the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by subtracting the number of subarrays with at most `k-1` odd numbers from the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers. This is based on the principle that the difference gives us the exact count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers.",
