INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays within `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

## Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, identify the positions of all odd numbers in the array.
   - Use these positions to determine the subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.
   - For each subarray with exactly `k` odd numbers, calculate the number of possible subarrays by considering the number of even numbers before the first odd number and after the last odd number in the subarray.
   - Use a sliding window approach to efficiently count these subarrays.

## Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a list `odd_indices` to store indices of odd numbers in `nums`.
   Iterate over `nums` and populate `odd_indices` with indices of odd numbers.
   
   Initialize `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of nice subarrays.
   
   Iterate over `odd_indices` with a window of size `k`:
       - For each window, calculate the number of even numbers before the first odd number in the window.
       - Calculate the number of even numbers after the last odd number in the window.
       - The number of nice subarrays for this window is the product of the two calculated numbers.
       - Add this product to `count`.
   
   Return `count`.
   ```

## Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Find all indices of odd numbers in the array
        odd_indices = []
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num % 2 == 1:
                odd_indices.append(i)
        
        # Step 2: Initialize the count of nice subarrays
        count = 0
        
        # Step 3: Iterate over the odd indices with a window of size k
        for i in range(len(odd_indices) - k + 1):
            # Start and end of the current window of k odd numbers
            start = odd_indices[i]
            end = odd_indices[i + k - 1]
            
            # Calculate the number of even numbers before the first odd number in the window
            if i == 0:
                left_even_count = start + 1
            else:
                left_even_count = start - odd_indices[i - 1]
            
            # Calculate the number of even numbers after the last odd number in the window
            if i + k == len(odd_indices):
                right_even_count = len(nums) - end
            else:
                right_even_count = odd_indices[i + k] - end
            
            # Add the number of nice subarrays for this window to the count
            count += left_even_count * right_even_count
        
        # Step 4: Return the total count of nice subarrays
        return count
```

This solution efficiently counts the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by leveraging the positions of odd numbers and calculating possible subarrays using a sliding window approach.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries Q. For each query, we need to determine the number of subsets in which the Ith number appears at the Kth position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number I to be at the Kth position in a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers smaller than I in the subset. This means we need to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, I-1\}\).

        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from \(I-1\) numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{I-1}{K-1}\).

        3. **Remaining Elements**: After placing I at the Kth position, the remaining elements of the subset can be any subset of the numbers greater than I, i.e., from the set \(\{I+1, I+2, \ldots, N\}\). There are \(2^{N-I}\) such subsets.

        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we can precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible N.

        ## Pseudocode

        1. Precompute factorials and their inverses modulo \(10^9 + 7\) up to the maximum N.
        2. For each test case:
           - For each query (I, K):
             - If \(K > I\), output 0 (impossible to have I at Kth position).
             - Otherwise, compute the number of subsets using the formula:
               \[
               \text{result} = \binom{I-1}{K-1} \times 2^{N-I} \mod (10^9 + 7)
               \]
        3. Output the result for each query.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays (subsequences of consecutive elements) in `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify the positions of odd numbers in the array. This will help us in determining the subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

2. **Use Two Pointers**: We can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. The idea is to maintain a window that contains exactly `k` odd numbers and count the number of such windows.

3. **Count Subarrays**: For each valid window (subarray) that contains exactly `k` odd numbers, we can extend the window to the left and right to count all possible subarrays that still contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

4. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the array, adjusting the window size using the two pointers, and count the number of valid subarrays.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start of the array.
2. Initialize a counter `odd_count` to count the number of odd numbers in the current window.
3. Initialize a variable `result` to store the number of nice subarrays.
4. Iterate `right` over the array:
   - If `nums[right]` is odd, increment `odd_count`.
   - While `odd_count` is greater than `k`, increment `left` and decrement `odd_count` if `nums[left]` is odd.
   - If `odd_count` equals `k`, count the number of subarrays ending at `right` with exactly `k` odd numbers.
5. Return `result`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        def count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k):
            left = 0
            odd_count = 0
            result = 0
            for right in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                    odd_count += 1
                while odd_count > k:
                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                        odd_count -= 1
                    left += 1

        return count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k) - count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k - 1)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- The function `count_at_most_k_odd` calculates the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers using a sliding window approach.
- The main function `numberOfSubarrays` calculates the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by subtracting the number of subarrays with at most `k-1` odd numbers from the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers. This is based on the principle that the difference gives us the exact count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers.

3. **Count Subarrays**: For each valid window (subarray) that contains exactly `k` odd numbers, we can extend the window to the left and right to count all possible subarrays that still contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

4. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the array, adjusting the window size using the two pointers, and count the number of valid subarrays.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start of the array.
2. Initialize a counter `odd_count` to count the number of odd numbers in the current window.
3. Initialize a variable `result` to store the number of nice subarrays.
4. Iterate `right` over the array:
   - If `nums[right]` is odd, increment `odd_count`.
   - While `odd_count` is greater than `k`, increment `left` and decrement `odd_count` if `nums[left]` is odd.
   - If `odd_count` equals `k`, count the number of subarrays ending at `right` with exactly `k` odd numbers.
5. Return `result`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        def count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k):
            left = 0
            odd_count = 0
            result = 0
            for right in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                    odd_count += 1
                while odd_count > k:
                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                        odd_count -= 1
                    left += 1
                result += right - left + 1
            return result
        
        # The number of subarrays with exactly k odd numbers is the difference
        # between the number of subarrays with at most k odd numbers and the
        # number of subarrays with at most k-1 odd numbers.
        return count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k) - count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k - 1)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- The function `count_at_most_k_odd` calculates the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers using a sliding window approach.
- The main function `numberOfSubarrays` calculates the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by subtracting the number of subarrays with at most `k-1` odd numbers from the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers. This is based on the principle that the difference gives us the exact count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays in a given list of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. The core concept here was to efficiently count subarrays using a sliding window technique, which is well-suited for problems involving contiguous subarrays with specific properties.

The key strategy was to use a helper function to count subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers and then use this to derive the count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. This was achieved by calculating the difference between the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers and those with at most `k-1` odd numbers. This approach leverages the inclusion-exclusion principle to isolate the exact count of subarrays with `k` odd numbers.

The sliding window technique was implemented using two pointers (`left` and `right`) to maintain a window of elements in the array. As the `right` pointer traverses the array, the `left` pointer adjusts to ensure the window contains at most `k` odd numbers. This method efficiently counts valid subarrays by considering all possible subarrays ending at each position.

This problem reinforced the utility of the sliding window technique for problems involving contiguous subarrays and specific counting conditions. It also highlighted the importance of breaking down complex counting problems into simpler subproblems that can be solved using efficient algorithms.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] The official solution provides an insightful approach to solving the problem by focusing on the gaps between odd numbers. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

1. **Identify Gaps Between Odds**: The solution first identifies the lengths of contiguous even numbers between odd numbers. This is done by iterating through the array and counting the number of even numbers until an odd number is encountered. Each time an odd number is found, the count of even numbers (plus one) is stored in a list called `edge`.

2. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the number of odd numbers in the array is less than `k`, the function immediately returns 0, as it's impossible to have a subarray with `k` odd numbers.

3. **Calculate Subarrays**: For each possible starting position of a subarray with exactly `k` odd numbers, the solution calculates the number of valid subarrays by multiplying the number of ways to choose the starting even numbers and the ending even numbers. This is done using the `edge` list, where `edge[i]` represents the number of ways to extend the subarray to the left, and `edge[i+k]` represents the number of ways to extend it to the right.

This approach is efficient because it reduces the problem to counting combinations of even numbers around odd numbers, rather than explicitly iterating over all possible subarrays. It leverages the fact that the number of ways to form a subarray with `k` odd numbers is determined by the even numbers surrounding those odd numbers. This method is both time-efficient and easy to understand once the concept of counting even-number gaps is clear.

[Problem]
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer k. A continuous subarray is called nice if there are k odd numbers on it.
    Return the number of nice sub-arrays.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The only sub-arrays with 3 odd numbers are [1,1,2,1] and [1,2,1,1].

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [2,4,6], k = 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation: There is no odd numbers in the array.

    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2], k = 2
    Output: 16

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 50000
    1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
    1 <= k <= nums.length
[/Problem]

[Solution]

    class Solution:
        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            def count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k):
                left = 0
                odd_count = 0
                result = 0
                for right in range(len(nums)):
                    if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                        odd_count += 1
                    while odd_count > k:
                        if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                            odd_count -= 1
                        left += 1
                    result += right - left + 1
                return result
        
            # The number of subarrays with exactly k odd numbers is the difference
            # between the number of subarrays with at most k odd numbers and the
            # number of subarrays with at most k-1 odd numbers.
            return count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k) - count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k - 1)
