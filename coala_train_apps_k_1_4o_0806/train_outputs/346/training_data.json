    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays in a given list of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. The core concept here was to efficiently count subarrays using a sliding window technique, which is well-suited for problems involving contiguous subarrays with specific properties.\n\nThe key strategy was to use a helper function to count subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers and then use this to derive the count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. This was achieved by calculating the difference between the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers and those with at most `k-1` odd numbers. This approach leverages the inclusion-exclusion principle to isolate the exact count of subarrays with `k` odd numbers.\n\nThe sliding window technique was implemented using two pointers (`left` and `right`) to maintain a window of elements in the array. As the `right` pointer traverses the array, the `left` pointer adjusts to ensure the window contains at most `k` odd numbers. This method efficiently counts valid subarrays by considering all possible subarrays ending at each position.\n\nThis problem reinforced the utility of the sliding window technique for problems involving contiguous subarrays and specific counting conditions. It also highlighted the importance of breaking down complex counting problems into simpler subproblems that can be solved using efficient algorithms.",
    "reflection": "The official solution provides an insightful approach to solving the problem by focusing on the gaps between odd numbers. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:\n\n1. **Identify Gaps Between Odds**: The solution first identifies the lengths of contiguous even numbers between odd numbers. This is done by iterating through the array and counting the number of even numbers until an odd number is encountered. Each time an odd number is found, the count of even numbers (plus one) is stored in a list called `edge`.\n\n2. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the number of odd numbers in the array is less than `k`, the function immediately returns 0, as it's impossible to have a subarray with `k` odd numbers.\n\n3. **Calculate Subarrays**: For each possible starting position of a subarray with exactly `k` odd numbers, the solution calculates the number of valid subarrays by multiplying the number of ways to choose the starting even numbers and the ending even numbers. This is done using the `edge` list, where `edge[i]` represents the number of ways to extend the subarray to the left, and `edge[i+k]` represents the number of ways to extend it to the right.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it reduces the problem to counting combinations of even numbers around odd numbers, rather than explicitly iterating over all possible subarrays. It leverages the fact that the number of ways to form a subarray with `k` odd numbers is determined by the even numbers surrounding those odd numbers. This method is both time-efficient and easy to understand once the concept of counting even-number gaps is clear.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThe function calculates the number of contiguous subarrays within a given list of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. It does this by determining the difference between the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers and the number of subarrays with at most `k-1` odd numbers. This approach leverages a sliding window technique to efficiently count subarrays with a bounded number of odd numbers. The function iterates through the list, adjusting the window size to maintain the desired count of odd numbers, and accumulates the count of valid subarrays. The result is returned as the total number of subarrays that meet the exact condition of having `k` odd numbers.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to find subarrays with specific properties, such as a certain number of odd numbers, within a larger array. This problem is a common type of sliding window problem, which is a technique often used in competitive programming and algorithm design to efficiently solve problems involving subarrays or substrings. The solution involves counting subarrays with at most a certain number of odd numbers and using this to find the exact count of subarrays with exactly that number of odd numbers. This approach can be adapted to other problems where the goal is to count subarrays with a specific characteristic, such as a sum or product constraint, by modifying the condition checked within the sliding window."
