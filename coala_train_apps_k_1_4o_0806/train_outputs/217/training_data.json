    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to find the number of unique results from bitwise OR operations on all contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The core concept here is understanding how the bitwise OR operation works and how it can be efficiently computed over subarrays.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Bitwise OR Properties**: The OR operation is cumulative in the sense that adding more elements to a subarray can only maintain or increase the OR result.\n- **Set for Uniqueness**: Using a set to track results ensures that duplicates are automatically handled, which is crucial for counting unique results.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Dynamic Approach**: Instead of recalculating the OR for every possible subarray, maintain a set of results from the previous iteration (`prev`). For each new element, compute the OR with each element in `prev` and add the new element itself. This reduces redundant calculations.\n- **Iterative Update**: For each element in the array, update the `prev` set with new OR results and add these to a global `results` set to track all unique OR results.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n        results = set()\n        prev = set()\n        \n        for x in A:\n            current = {x}\n            for y in prev:\n                current.add(x | y)\n            prev = current\n            results.update(current)\n        \n        return len(results)\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the number of unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to manage unique results. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, both my solution and the official solution employ a similar approach to efficiently calculate the number of unique bitwise OR results from all contiguous subarrays of the given array. The key insight is to use sets to track unique OR results, leveraging the properties of the bitwise OR operation.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Dynamic OR Calculation**: Both solutions avoid recalculating the OR for every possible subarray from scratch. Instead, they build upon the results of previous subarrays, which is more efficient.\n\n2. **Use of Sets**: Sets are used to automatically handle duplicates and efficiently manage unique results. This is crucial because the problem requires counting only unique OR results.\n\n3. **Iterative Update**: For each element in the array, the current set of OR results is updated by combining the new element with all previous results. This ensures that all possible subarray OR results ending at the current element are considered.\n\n### Differences:\n\n- **Set Operations**: The official solution uses set comprehensions and union operations (`|=`) to update the sets, which is a more concise and Pythonic way to achieve the same result. My solution used explicit loops and the `update` method, which is slightly more verbose.\n\n- **Variable Naming**: The official solution uses `cur` and `res` for the current and result sets, respectively, which are more concise than `prev` and `results` in my solution.\n\nOverall, the official solution is slightly more elegant and concise, but both approaches are fundamentally similar in logic and efficiency. This problem reinforced the importance of leveraging set operations for managing unique results and the efficiency gains from dynamic programming techniques in problems involving subarrays.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThe function takes a list of integers and calculates the number of distinct values that can be obtained by performing bitwise OR operations on all possible subarrays of the list. It initializes a set to store unique OR results and iterates through each element in the list, maintaining a set of OR results from the previous iteration. For each element, it creates a new set containing the element itself and updates it with OR results from the previous set. The function updates the global results set with the current OR results and finally returns the count of unique OR results.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the number of unique results from bitwise operations over subarrays of an array. This can be applied in problems involving bitwise operations, set operations, and dynamic programming. It is particularly relevant in competitive programming and algorithm design where optimizing for unique results from a large set of operations is necessary. Understanding how to efficiently compute and store unique results using sets can be applied to other problems involving unique combinations or results from iterative processes."
