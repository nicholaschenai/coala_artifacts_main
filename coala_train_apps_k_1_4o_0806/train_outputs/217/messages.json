We need to find out how many unique results we can get from these operations.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. This means that as we extend a subarray, the result of the OR operation can only stay the same or increase.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Subarrays**: We need to consider all possible subarrays. However, instead of recalculating the OR for each subarray from scratch, we can build on the results of previous subarrays.\n\n3. **Use Sets for Uniqueness**: We can use sets to keep track of unique OR results. For each element in the array, we can maintain a set of OR results that can be achieved by extending subarrays ending at that element.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can calculate the OR results by taking the OR of `A[i]` with each result from the previous set of OR results. This way, we efficiently propagate the OR results through the array.\n\n5. **Final Result**: The union of all sets of OR results gives us the unique OR results for all subarrays.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction subarrayBitwiseORs(A):\n    initialize a set `result` to store unique OR results\n    initialize a set `current` to store OR results for subarrays ending at the current element\n\n    for each element `a` in A:\n        initialize a new set `new_current`\n        add `a` to `new_current`\n        for each OR result `x` in `current`:\n            add `x OR a` to `new_current`\n        update `current` to `new_current`\n        add all elements of `current` to `result`\n\n    return the size of `result`\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize a set to store all unique OR results\n        result = set()\n        # Initialize a set to store OR results for subarrays ending at the current element\n        current = set()\n        \n        for a in A:\n            # Start a new set for the current element\n            new_current = {a}\n            # Update the new_current set with OR results from the previous current set\n            for x in current:\n                new_current.add(x | a)\n            # Update the current set to the new_current set\n            current = new_current\n            # Add all elements of the current set to the result set\n            result.update(current)\n        \n        # Return the number of unique OR results\n        return len(result)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to maintain uniqueness. The time complexity is manageable due to the limited number of unique OR results that can be generated from the given constraints."
