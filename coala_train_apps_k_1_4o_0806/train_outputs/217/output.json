    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given an array `A` of non-negative integers. For every contiguous subarray `B` of `A`, we compute the bitwise OR of all elements in `B`. We need to return the number of unique results obtained from these operations.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number that has a bit set if either of the original numbers had that bit set. This means that as we extend a subarray, the result of the OR operation can only stay the same or increase.\n\n2. **Tracking Unique Results**: We need to track all unique results of the OR operations. Using a set is ideal for this purpose because it automatically handles duplicates.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the OR for every possible subarray, we can use a dynamic approach:\n   - Maintain a set of results from the previous iteration (`prev`).\n   - For each new element in the array, calculate the OR with each element in `prev` and add the new element itself.\n   - Update `prev` to include these new results.\n   - Add all results from `prev` to a global set `results` to track all unique OR results.\n\n4. **Iterate Over the Array**: For each element in the array, update the `prev` set and the global `results` set.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction subarrayBitwiseORs(A):\n    initialize results as an empty set\n    initialize prev as an empty set\n\n    for each element x in A:\n        initialize current as a set containing x\n        for each element y in prev:\n            add (x OR y) to current\n        update prev to be current\n        add all elements of current to results\n\n    return the size of results\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize a set to store all unique OR results\n        results = set()\n        # Initialize a set to store OR results of the previous iteration\n        prev = set()\n        \n        # Iterate over each element in the array\n        for x in A:\n            # Start a new set for the current element\n            current = {x}\n            # Update current with OR results from previous results\n            for y in prev:\n                current.add(x | y)\n            # Update prev to be the current set of results\n            prev = current\n            # Add all current results to the global results set\n            results.update(current)\n        \n        # Return the number of unique results\n        return len(results)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the number of unique bitwise OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to manage unique results.",
