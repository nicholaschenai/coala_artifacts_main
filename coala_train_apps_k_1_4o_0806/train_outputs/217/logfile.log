INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array `A` of non-negative integers. For every contiguous subarray `B` of `A`, we compute the bitwise OR of all elements in `B`. We need to find out how many unique results we can get from these operations.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. This means that as we extend a subarray, the result of the OR operation can only stay the same or increase.

2. **Iterate Over Subarrays**: We need to consider all possible subarrays. However, instead of recalculating the OR for each subarray from scratch, we can build on the results of previous subarrays.

3. **Use Sets for Uniqueness**: We can use sets to keep track of unique OR results. For each element in the array, we can maintain a set of OR results that can be achieved by extending subarrays ending at that element.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can calculate the OR results by taking the OR of `A[i]` with each result from the previous set of OR results. This way, we efficiently propagate the OR results through the array.

5. **Final Result**: The union of all sets of OR results gives us the unique OR results for all subarrays.

## Pseudocode

```
function subarrayBitwiseORs(A):
    initialize a set `result` to store unique OR results
    initialize a set `current` to store OR results for subarrays ending at the current element

    for each element `a` in A:
        initialize a new set `new_current`
        add `a` to `new_current`
        for each OR result `x` in `current`:
            add `x OR a` to `new_current`
        update `current` to `new_current`
        add all elements of `current` to `result`

    return the size of `result`
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize a set to store all unique OR results
        result = set()
        # Initialize a set to store OR results for subarrays ending at the current element
        current = set()
        
        for a in A:
            # Start a new set for the current element
            new_current = {a}
            # Update the new_current set with OR results from the previous current set
            for x in current:
                new_current.add(x | a)
            # Update the current set to the new_current set
            current = new_current
            # Add all elements of the current set to the result set
            result.update(current)
        
        # Return the number of unique OR results
        return len(result)
```

This solution efficiently calculates the unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to maintain uniqueness. The time complexity is manageable due to the limited number of unique OR results that can be generated from the given constraints.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a list of strings, and we need to find the shortest string that contains each of the given strings as a substring. None of the strings in the list is a substring of another. The solution should be able to handle up to 12 strings, each with a length of up to 20 characters.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively merge strings by overlapping them as much as possible. We can calculate the overlap between two strings and use this information to build the shortest superstring. We will use a dynamic programming table to store the shortest superstring that can be formed using a subset of the strings, and we will update this table as we consider each string.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Define a function to calculate the overlap between two strings.
           Initialize a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset of strings.
           Initialize a table to store the path to reconstruct the superstring.
           For each subset of strings:
               For each string in the subset:
                   Calculate the shortest superstring by considering the overlap with other strings.
                   Update the DP table with the shortest superstring length.
                   Update the path table to keep track of the order of strings.
           Reconstruct the shortest superstring using the path table.
           Return the shortest superstring.
           ```

        This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the shortest superstring by considering all possible overlaps between the strings. The `overlap` function calculates the maximum overlap between two strings, which is used to update the DP table. The `path` table helps reconstruct the order of strings in the final superstring.

We are given an array `A` of non-negative integers. For every contiguous subarray `B` of `A`, we compute the bitwise OR of all elements in `B`. We need to return the number of unique results obtained from these operations.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number that has a bit set if either of the original numbers had that bit set. This means that as we extend a subarray, the result of the OR operation can only stay the same or increase.

2. **Tracking Unique Results**: We need to track all unique results of the OR operations. Using a set is ideal for this purpose because it automatically handles duplicates.

3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the OR for every possible subarray, we can use a dynamic approach:
   - Maintain a set of results from the previous iteration (`prev`).
   - For each new element in the array, calculate the OR with each element in `prev` and add the new element itself.
   - Update `prev` to include these new results.
   - Add all results from `prev` to a global set `results` to track all unique OR results.

4. **Iterate Over the Array**: For each element in the array, update the `prev` set and the global `results` set.

## Pseudocode

```
function subarrayBitwiseORs(A):
    initialize results as an empty set
    initialize prev as an empty set

    for each element x in A:
        initialize current as a set containing x
        for each element y in prev:
            add (x OR y) to current
        update prev to be current
        add all elements of current to results

    return the size of results
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize a set to store all unique OR results
        results = set()

            # Start a new set for the current element
            current = {x}

            for y in prev:
                current.add(x | y)

            results.update(current)
        
        # Return the number of unique results

INFO - [Task id] 217 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array `A` of non-negative integers. For every contiguous subarray `B` of `A`, we compute the bitwise OR of all elements in `B`. We need to return the number of unique results obtained from these operations.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number that has a bit set if either of the original numbers had that bit set. This means that as we extend a subarray, the result of the OR operation can only stay the same or increase.

2. **Tracking Unique Results**: We need to track all unique results of the OR operations. Using a set is ideal for this purpose because it automatically handles duplicates.

3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the OR for every possible subarray, we can use a dynamic approach:
   - Maintain a set of results from the previous iteration (`prev`).
   - For each new element in the array, calculate the OR with each element in `prev` and add the new element itself.
   - Update `prev` to include these new results.
   - Add all results from `prev` to a global set `results` to track all unique OR results.

4. **Iterate Over the Array**: For each element in the array, update the `prev` set and the global `results` set.

## Pseudocode

```
function subarrayBitwiseORs(A):
    initialize results as an empty set
    initialize prev as an empty set

    for each element x in A:
        initialize current as a set containing x
        for each element y in prev:
            add (x OR y) to current
        update prev to be current
        add all elements of current to results

    return the size of results
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize a set to store all unique OR results
        results = set()
        # Initialize a set to store OR results of the previous iteration
        prev = set()
        
        # Iterate over each element in the array
        for x in A:
            # Start a new set for the current element
            current = {x}
            # Update current with OR results from previous results
            for y in prev:
                current.add(x | y)
            # Update prev to be the current set of results
            prev = current
            # Add all current results to the global results set
            results.update(current)
        
        # Return the number of unique results
        return len(results)
```

This solution efficiently calculates the number of unique bitwise OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to manage unique results.

INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find the number of unique results from bitwise OR operations on all contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The core concept here is understanding how the bitwise OR operation works and how it can be efficiently computed over subarrays.

### Key Concepts:
- **Bitwise OR Properties**: The OR operation is cumulative in the sense that adding more elements to a subarray can only maintain or increase the OR result.
- **Set for Uniqueness**: Using a set to track results ensures that duplicates are automatically handled, which is crucial for counting unique results.

### Strategy:
- **Dynamic Approach**: Instead of recalculating the OR for every possible subarray, maintain a set of results from the previous iteration (`prev`). For each new element, compute the OR with each element in `prev` and add the new element itself. This reduces redundant calculations.
- **Iterative Update**: For each element in the array, update the `prev` set with new OR results and add these to a global `results` set to track all unique OR results.

### Code Snippet:
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        results = set()
        prev = set()
        
        for x in A:
            current = {x}
            for y in prev:
                current.add(x | y)
            prev = current
            results.update(current)
        
        return len(results)
```

This approach efficiently computes the number of unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to manage unique results. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency.

INFO - [Task id] 217 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array `A` of non-negative integers. For every contiguous subarray `B` of `A`, we compute the bitwise OR of all elements in `B`. We need to return the number of unique results obtained from these operations.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number that has a bit set if either of the original numbers had that bit set. This means that as we extend a subarray, the result of the OR operation can only stay the same or increase.

2. **Tracking Unique Results**: We need to track all unique results of the OR operations. Using a set is ideal for this purpose because it automatically handles duplicates.

   - Maintain a set of results from the previous iteration (`prev`).
   - For each new element in the array, calculate the OR with each element in `prev` and add the new element itself.
   - Update `prev` to include these new results.
   - Add all results from `prev` to a global set `results` to track all unique OR results.

4. **Iterate Over the Array**: For each element in the array, update the `prev` set and the global `results` set.

## Pseudocode

```
function subarrayBitwiseORs(A):
    initialize results as an empty set
    initialize prev as an empty set

    for each element x in A:
        initialize current as a set containing x
        for each element y in prev:
            add (x OR y) to current
        update prev to be current
        add all elements of current to results

    return the size of results
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize a set to store all unique OR results

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        res = set()
        cur = set()
        for a in A:
            cur = {a | i for i in cur}
            cur |= {a}
            res |= cur
        return len(res)

INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution employ a similar approach to efficiently calculate the number of unique bitwise OR results from all contiguous subarrays of the given array. The key insight is to use sets to track unique OR results, leveraging the properties of the bitwise OR operation.

### Key Insights:

1. **Dynamic OR Calculation**: Both solutions avoid recalculating the OR for every possible subarray from scratch. Instead, they build upon the results of previous subarrays, which is more efficient.

2. **Use of Sets**: Sets are used to automatically handle duplicates and efficiently manage unique results. This is crucial because the problem requires counting only unique OR results.

3. **Iterative Update**: For each element in the array, the current set of OR results is updated by combining the new element with all previous results. This ensures that all possible subarray OR results ending at the current element are considered.

### Differences:

- **Set Operations**: The official solution uses set comprehensions and union operations (`|=`) to update the sets, which is a more concise and Pythonic way to achieve the same result. My solution used explicit loops and the `update` method, which is slightly more verbose.

- **Variable Naming**: The official solution uses `cur` and `res` for the current and result sets, respectively, which are more concise than `prev` and `results` in my solution.

Overall, the official solution is slightly more elegant and concise, but both approaches are fundamentally similar in logic and efficiency. This problem reinforced the importance of leveraging set operations for managing unique results and the efficiency gains from dynamic programming techniques in problems involving subarrays.

This can be applied in problems involving bitwise operations, set operations, and dynamic programming. It is particularly relevant in competitive programming and algorithm design where optimizing for unique results from a large set of operations is necessary. Understanding how to efficiently compute and store unique results using sets can be applied to other problems involving unique combinations or results from iterative processes.",
