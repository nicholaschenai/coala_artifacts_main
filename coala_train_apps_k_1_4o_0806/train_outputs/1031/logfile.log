INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If no such triangle can exist, we should output \(-1\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Given Conditions**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( A = S \).

3. **Formulate the Problem**:
   - From the area formula: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - From the Pythagorean theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).

4. **Solve for \( a \) and \( b \)**:
   - Express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the area equation: \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Substitute \( b \) in the Pythagorean equation: \( a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2 \).
   - Simplify and solve the resulting quadratic equation in terms of \( a^2 \).

5. **Check for Validity**:
   - Ensure that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is non-negative for real solutions.
   - Calculate \( a \) and \( b \) and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality and area conditions.

6. **Output**:
   - If valid \( a \) and \( b \) are found, output them along with \( H \) in sorted order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output \(-1\).

## Pseudocode

```
function find_triangle_sides(H, S):
    if 4 * S > H^2:
        return -1
    discriminant = H^4 - 16 * S^2
    if discriminant < 0:
        return -1
    a_squared = (H^2 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    b_squared = (H^2 - sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    if a_squared < 0 or b_squared < 0:
        return -1
    a = sqrt(a_squared)
    b = sqrt(b_squared)
    return sorted([a, b, H])

read T
for each test case:
    read H, S
    result = find_triangle_sides(H, S)
    print result
```

## Python Code

```python
import sys
import math

def find_triangle_sides(H, S):
    # Check if the area is too large for the given hypotenuse
    if 4 * S > H * H:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation
    discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S
    
    # If the discriminant is negative, no real solutions exist
    if discriminant < 0:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate a^2 and b^2 using the quadratic formula
    a_squared = (H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    b_squared = (H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    
    # If either a^2 or b^2 is negative, no valid triangle sides exist
    if a_squared < 0 or b_squared < 0:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the actual side lengths
    a = math.sqrt(a_squared)
    b = math.sqrt(b_squared)
    
    # Return the sides sorted in non-decreasing order
    return f"{min(a, b):.5f} {max(a, b):.5f} {H:.5f}"

[Reflection]:
    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Process

    The problem required finding the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that covers a set of points, with one side having a specific slope. The key challenge was correctly transforming the coordinate system to align the rectangle with the given slope.

    ### Insights from the Official Solution

    1. **Coordinate Transformation**:
       - The official solution uses a transformation based on trigonometric identities to align the rectangle with the slope M. Specifically, it calculates the cosine and sine of the angle derived from the slope M using the formula:
         \[
         \text{cos}(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + M^2}}, \quad \text{sin}(\theta) = \frac{M}{\sqrt{1 + M^2}}
         \]
       - This transformation is more direct and avoids the need for calculating the angle explicitly using `atan`.

    2. **Efficiency**:
       - The solution efficiently computes the transformed coordinates and directly calculates the bounds (min and max) for these coordinates to determine the rectangle's dimensions.
       - This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, as it processes each point in constant time and uses minimal additional space.

    3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
       - The perimeter is calculated using the differences between the maximum and minimum transformed coordinates, which directly gives the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.

    ### Key Takeaways

    - **Trigonometric Transformations**: Using trigonometric identities can simplify the transformation process, especially when dealing with slopes and angles.
    - **Direct Calculation**: Avoid unnecessary calculations by directly using mathematical properties (like the Pythagorean identity) to derive needed values.
    - **Precision**: Ensure that calculations maintain precision, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic, to meet problem constraints.

    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric transformations and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify complex problems.

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( A = S \).
   - We need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
     - \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \)
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \)

3. **Deriving Equations**:
   - From the area equation: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - Substitute \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean theorem:
     - \( a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2 \)
     - Simplify to get a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \).

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   - Solve the quadratic equation to find possible values of \( a \).
   - Calculate \( b \) using \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Check if the calculated \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy the triangle inequality and are positive.

5. **Output**:
   - If valid \( a \) and \( b \) are found, output them along with \( H \) in non-decreasing order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output -1.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_triangle_sides(T, test_cases):
    for each (H, S) in test_cases:
        if 2 * S > H^2:
            output -1

        a1 = sqrt((H^2 + sqrt(H^4 - 16 * S^2)) / 2)
        a2 = sqrt((H^2 - sqrt(H^4 - 16 * S^2)) / 2)
        
        b1 = 2 * S / a1
        b2 = 2 * S / a2

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( A = S \).
   - We need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
     - \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \)
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \)

3. **Deriving Equations**:
   - From the area equation: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - Substitute \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean theorem:
     - \( a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2 \)
     - Simplify to get a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \).

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   - Solve the quadratic equation to find possible values of \( a \).
   - Calculate \( b \) using \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Check if the calculated \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy the triangle inequality and are positive.

5. **Output**:
   - If valid \( a \) and \( b \) are found, output them along with \( H \) in non-decreasing order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output -1.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_triangle_sides(T, test_cases):
    for each (H, S) in test_cases:
        if 2 * S > H^2:
            output -1
            continue
        
        a1 = sqrt((H^2 + sqrt(H^4 - 16 * S^2)) / 2)
        a2 = sqrt((H^2 - sqrt(H^4 - 16 * S^2)) / 2)
        
        b1 = 2 * S / a1
        b2 = 2 * S / a2
        
        if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and a1^2 + b1^2 == H^2:
            output sorted(a1, b1, H)
        elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and a2^2 + b2^2 == H^2:
            output sorted(a2, b2, H)
        else:
            output -1
```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \).
   - If such a triangle exists, output the side lengths in non-decreasing order; otherwise, output -1.

2. **Reviewing the Code**:
   - The code reads input and processes each test case to find potential side lengths \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It uses the quadratic formula to derive potential values for \( a \) and calculates \( b \) from \( a \).
   - It checks if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem and outputs the result.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Input/Output Handling**: The code might not be correctly reading from or writing to standard input/output. This is a common issue when the function is defined but not called.
   - **Mathematical Calculations**: The calculations for \( a \) and \( b \) might not be handling edge cases correctly, such as when the discriminant is negative or when the calculated sides do not satisfy the triangle inequality.
   - **Precision and Comparison**: The comparison for checking if \( a^2 + b^2 \approx H^2 \) might not be precise enough, especially with floating-point arithmetic.

4. **Steps to Fix**:
   - Ensure the function is called to execute the logic.
   - Double-check the mathematical logic for calculating \( a \) and \( b \).
   - Improve precision handling and ensure the output format matches the requirements.

Let's revise the code to address these issues:

```python
import sys
import math

def find_triangle_sides():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        H = int(data[index])
        S = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        if 2 * S > H * H:
            results.append("-1")
            continue
        
        try:
            # Calculate potential a values
            discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S
            if discriminant < 0:
                results.append("-1")
                continue
            
            a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
            a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
            
            # Calculate corresponding b values
            b1 = 2 * S / a1
            b2 = 2 * S / a2
            
            # Check if a1, b1 is a valid solution
            if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:
                results.append(f"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}")
            # Check if a2, b2 is a valid solution
            elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:
                results.append(f"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}")
            else:
                results.append("-1")
        except ValueError:
            results.append("-1")
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

# Call the function to execute
find_triangle_sides()
```

### Key Changes:
- **Function Call**: Ensure the function `find_triangle_sides()` is called to execute the logic.
- **Discriminant Check**: Added a check for the discriminant to ensure it is non-negative before proceeding with square root calculations.
- **Precision Handling**: Improved precision handling by checking the condition with a small tolerance.
- **Output Format**: Ensured the output format matches the requirements with five decimal places.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( A = S \).
   - We need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
     - \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \)
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \)

3. **Deriving Equations**:
   - From the area equation: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - Substitute \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean theorem:
     - \( a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2 \)
     - Simplify to get a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \).

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   - Solve the quadratic equation to find possible values of \( a \).
   - Calculate \( b \) using \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Check if the calculated \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy the triangle inequality and are positive.

5. **Output**:
   - If valid \( a \) and \( b \) are found, output them along with \( H \) in non-decreasing order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output -1.

## Pseudocode

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \).
   - If such a triangle exists, output the side lengths in non-decreasing order; otherwise, output -1.

2. **Reviewing the Code**:
   - The code reads input and processes each test case to find potential side lengths \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It uses the quadratic formula to derive potential values for \( a \) and calculates \( b \) from \( a \).
   - It checks if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem and outputs the result.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Input/Output Handling**: The code might not be correctly reading from or writing to standard input/output. This is a common issue when the function is defined but not called.
   - **Mathematical Calculations**: The calculations for \( a \) and \( b \) might not be handling edge cases correctly, such as when the discriminant is negative or when the calculated sides do not satisfy the triangle inequality.
   - **Precision and Comparison**: The comparison for checking if \( a^2 + b^2 \approx H^2 \) might not be precise enough, especially with floating-point arithmetic.

4. **Steps to Fix**:
   - Ensure the function is called to execute the logic.
   - Double-check the mathematical logic for calculating \( a \) and \( b \).
   - Improve precision handling and ensure the output format matches the requirements.

Let's revise the code to address these issues:

```python
import sys
import math

def find_triangle_sides():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        H = int(data[index])
        S = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        if 2 * S > H * H:
            results.append("-1")
            continue
        
        try:
            # Calculate potential a values
            discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S
            if discriminant < 0:
                results.append("-1")
                continue
            
            a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
            a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
            
            # Calculate corresponding b values
            b1 = 2 * S / a1
            b2 = 2 * S / a2
            
            # Check if a1, b1 is a valid solution
            if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:
                results.append(f"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}")
            # Check if a2, b2 is a valid solution
            elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:
                results.append(f"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}")
            else:
                results.append("-1")
        except ValueError:
            results.append("-1")
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

# Call the function to execute
find_triangle_sides()
```

### Key Changes:
- **Function Call**: Ensure the function `find_triangle_sides()` is called to execute the logic.
- **Discriminant Check**: Added a check for the discriminant to ensure it is non-negative before proceeding with square root calculations.
- **Precision Handling**: Improved precision handling by checking the condition with a small tolerance.
- **Output Format**: Ensured the output format matches the requirements with five decimal places.

    [Task]:
        Today, Chef has a fencing job at hand and has to fence up a surface covering N$N$ points. 
        To minimize his work, he started looking for an algorithm that had him fence the least amount of length. 
        He came up with the Convex Hull algorithm, but soon realized it gave him some random shape to fence. However, Chef likes rectangles and has a favourite number M$M$. 
        Help him find the minimum perimeter he has to fence if he wants to fence a rectangle, with slope of one of the sides as M$M$, to cover all the points.

        -----Input:-----
        - The first line contains two integers N$N$ and M$M$, the number of points and the Chef's favourite Number.
        - The next n lines contain two space separated integers X$X$ and Y$Y$, the coordinates of the point.

        -----Output:-----
        Print a single decimal number, denoting the perimeter of the rectangle. Answer will considered correct if it has absolute error less than 10âˆ’6$10^{-6}$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 2â‰¤Nâ‰¤1000000$2 \leq N \leq 1000000$
        - âˆ’1000â‰¤Mâ‰¤1000$-1000 \leq M \leq 1000$
        - âˆ’1000000â‰¤Xâ‰¤1000000$-1000000 \leq X \leq 1000000$
        - âˆ’1000000â‰¤Yâ‰¤1000000$-1000000 \leq Y \leq 1000000$

        -----Sample Input:-----
        4 1
        0 1
        0 -1
        1 0
        -1 0

        -----Sample Output:-----
        5.656854249492380

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the code went wrong.

        ### Problem Analysis

        1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**:
           - The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope M. This means the rectangle is not axis-aligned but rotated.
           - The transformation of coordinates should align the rectangle with the slope M and its perpendicular.

        2. **Coordinate Transformation**:
           - The transformation should correctly map the original coordinates to a new system where the rectangle sides are aligned with the slopes M and -1/M.
           - The transformation equations used in the code might not be correctly aligning the rectangle.

        3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
           - The perimeter is calculated based on the transformed coordinates, but the transformation might not be correct, leading to incorrect perimeter values.

        ### Mistakes in the Solution

        1. **Incorrect Transformation**:
           - The transformation equations used in the code might not correctly align the rectangle with the desired slope M.
           - The transformation should consider the rotation of the coordinate system to align with the slope M.

        2. **Perimeter Calculation**:
           - The perimeter calculation assumes the transformed coordinates directly give the side lengths, which might not be the case if the transformation is incorrect.

        ### Correct Approach

        1. **Correct Transformation**:
           - Use a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The rotation angle can be derived from the slope M.
           - The angle Î¸ can be calculated using `tan(Î¸) = M`, and the rotation matrix can be used to transform the points.

        2. **Calculate Bounds**:
           - After transforming the points, calculate the minimum and maximum values in the new coordinate system to determine the bounds of the rectangle.

        3. **Calculate Perimeter**:
           - Use the bounds to calculate the side lengths and then the perimeter.

        Let's correct the code with these considerations.

        ```python
        import sys
        import math

        def calculate_perimeter():

            min_y_prime = float('inf')

                # Transform the coordinates using rotation
                x_prime = X * cos_theta + Y * sin_theta
                y_prime = -X * sin_theta + Y * cos_theta
        
                # Update min and max for transformed coordinates
                min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
                max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
                min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
                max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
    
            # Calculate the side lengths in the transformed space
            length_x_prime = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
            length_y_prime = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
            # Calculate the perimeter
            perimeter = 2 * (length_x_prime + length_y_prime)
    
            # Print the perimeter with high precision
            print(f"{perimeter:.12f}")

        # Call the function to execute
        calculate_perimeter()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Rotation Matrix**: The transformation uses a rotation matrix derived from the angle Î¸, which is calculated using the slope M.
        - **Coordinate Transformation**: Each point is transformed using the rotation matrix to align the rectangle with the slope M.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( A = S \).
   - We need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
     - \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \)
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \)

3. **Deriving Equations**:
   - From the area equation: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - Substitute \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean theorem:
     - \( a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2 \)
     - Simplify to get a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \).

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   - Solve the quadratic equation to find possible values of \( a \).
   - Calculate \( b \) using \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Check if the calculated \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy the triangle inequality and are positive.

5. **Output**:
   - If valid \( a \) and \( b \) are found, output them along with \( H \) in non-decreasing order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output -1.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_triangle_sides(T, test_cases):
    for each (H, S) in test_cases:
        if 2 * S > H^2:
            output -1
            continue
        
        a1 = sqrt((H^2 + sqrt(H^4 - 16 * S^2)) / 2)
        a2 = sqrt((H^2 - sqrt(H^4 - 16 * S^2)) / 2)
        
        b1 = 2 * S / a1
        b2 = 2 * S / a2
        
        if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and a1^2 + b1^2 == H^2:
            output sorted(a1, b1, H)
        elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and a2^2 + b2^2 == H^2:
            output sorted(a2, b2, H)
        else:
            output -1
```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \).
   - If such a triangle exists, output the side lengths in non-decreasing order; otherwise, output -1.

2. **Reviewing the Code**:
   - The code reads input and processes each test case to find potential side lengths \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It uses the quadratic formula to derive potential values for \( a \) and calculates \( b \) from \( a \).
   - It checks if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem and outputs the result.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Input/Output Handling**: The code might not be correctly reading from or writing to standard input/output. This is a common issue when the function is defined but not called.
   - **Mathematical Calculations**: The calculations for \( a \) and \( b \) might not be handling edge cases correctly, such as when the discriminant is negative or when the calculated sides do not satisfy the triangle inequality.
   - **Precision and Comparison**: The comparison for checking if \( a^2 + b^2 \approx H^2 \) might not be precise enough, especially with floating-point arithmetic.

4. **Steps to Fix**:
   - Ensure the function is called to execute the logic.
   - Double-check the mathematical logic for calculating \( a \) and \( b \).
   - Improve precision handling and ensure the output format matches the requirements.

Let's revise the code to address these issues:

```python
import sys
import math

### Key Changes:
- **Function Call**: Ensure the function `find_triangle_sides()` is called to execute the logic.
- **Discriminant Check**: Added a check for the discriminant to ensure it is non-negative before proceeding with square root calculations.
- **Precision Handling**: Improved precision handling by checking the condition with a small tolerance.
- **Output Format**: Ensured the output format matches the requirements with five decimal places.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] In tackling the problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), the core concepts involved understanding the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \( a \) and \( b \) given these constraints.

### Key Concepts:
- **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).
- **Area Formula**: The area \( S \) is given by \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \).

### Strategy:
- **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \( a \).
- **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.
- **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

### Challenges and Fixes:
- **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.
- **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.
- **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( A = S \).
   - We need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
     - \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \)
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \)

3. **Deriving Equations**:
   - From the area equation: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - Substitute \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean theorem:
     - \( a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2 \)
     - Simplify to get a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \).

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation**:
   - Solve the quadratic equation to find possible values of \( a \).
   - Calculate \( b \) using \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Check if the calculated \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy the triangle inequality and are positive.

5. **Output**:
   - If valid \( a \) and \( b \) are found, output them along with \( H \) in non-decreasing order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output -1.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_triangle_sides(T, test_cases):
    for each (H, S) in test_cases:
        if 2 * S > H^2:
            output -1
            continue
        
        a1 = sqrt((H^2 + sqrt(H^4 - 16 * S^2)) / 2)
        a2 = sqrt((H^2 - sqrt(H^4 - 16 * S^2)) / 2)
        
        b1 = 2 * S / a1
        b2 = 2 * S / a2
        
        if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and a1^2 + b1^2 == H^2:
            output sorted(a1, b1, H)
        elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and a2^2 + b2^2 == H^2:
            output sorted(a2, b2, H)
        else:
            output -1

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \).
   - If such a triangle exists, output the side lengths in non-decreasing order; otherwise, output -1.

2. **Reviewing the Code**:
   - The code reads input and processes each test case to find potential side lengths \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It uses the quadratic formula to derive potential values for \( a \) and calculates \( b \) from \( a \).
   - It checks if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem and outputs the result.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Input/Output Handling**: The code might not be correctly reading from or writing to standard input/output. This is a common issue when the function is defined but not called.
   - **Mathematical Calculations**: The calculations for \( a \) and \( b \) might not be handling edge cases correctly, such as when the discriminant is negative or when the calculated sides do not satisfy the triangle inequality.
   - **Precision and Comparison**: The comparison for checking if \( a^2 + b^2 \approx H^2 \) might not be precise enough, especially with floating-point arithmetic.

4. **Steps to Fix**:
   - Ensure the function is called to execute the logic.
   - Double-check the mathematical logic for calculating \( a \) and \( b \).
   - Improve precision handling and ensure the output format matches the requirements.

Let's revise the code to address these issues:

            # Calculate corresponding b values
            b1 = 2 * S / a1

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem required finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse and area. The challenge was to derive the side lengths using the Pythagorean theorem and the area formula, which required solving a quadratic equation.

2. **Mathematical Insight**: The official solution effectively uses the discriminant of the quadratic equation to determine if a valid triangle can exist. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the square root operations are valid and that the triangle sides are real numbers.

3. **Precision Handling**: Both the official solution and my final solution emphasize the importance of handling floating-point precision correctly. This is crucial when comparing calculated values to ensure they satisfy the conditions of the problem.

4. **Input/Output Handling**: The official solution uses a simple loop to process multiple test cases, which is efficient given the constraints. My initial oversight was not ensuring the function was called, which is a common mistake when dealing with input/output in competitive programming.

5. **Code Efficiency**: The official solution is concise and directly addresses the problem requirements without unnecessary complexity. It highlights the importance of focusing on the core mathematical logic and ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.

In summary, this exercise reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation, precision in floating-point arithmetic, and robust input/output handling. These are critical skills in competitive programming and algorithm design.

[Problem]
    Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
    Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

    -----Input-----
    The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
    For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

    -----Output-----
    Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.
