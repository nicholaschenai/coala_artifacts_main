Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question \"Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?\"\nChefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.\nFor each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order.

The key challenge was correctly transforming the coordinate system to align the rectangle with the given slope.\n\n    ### Insights from the Official Solution\n\n    1. **Coordinate Transformation**:\n       - The official solution uses a transformation based on trigonometric identities to align the rectangle with the slope M. Specifically, it calculates the cosine and sine of the angle derived from the slope M using the formula:\n         \\[\n         \\text{cos}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}}, \\quad \\text{sin}(\\theta) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}}\n         \\]\n       - This transformation is more direct and avoids the need for calculating the angle explicitly using `atan`.\n\n    2. **Efficiency**:\n       - The solution efficiently computes the transformed coordinates and directly calculates the bounds (min and max) for these coordinates to determine the rectangle's dimensions.\n       - This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, as it processes each point in constant time and uses minimal additional space.\n\n    3. **Perimeter Calculation**:\n       - The perimeter is calculated using the differences between the maximum and minimum transformed coordinates, which directly gives the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways\n\n    - **Trigonometric Transformations**: Using trigonometric identities can simplify the transformation process, especially when dealing with slopes and angles.\n    - **Direct Calculation**: Avoid unnecessary calculations by directly using mathematical properties (like the Pythagorean identity) to derive needed values.\n    - **Precision**: Ensure that calculations maintain precision, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic, to meet problem constraints.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric transformations and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify complex problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This means the rectangle is not axis-aligned but rotated.\n           - The transformation of coordinates should align the rectangle with the slope M and its perpendicular.\n\n        2. **Coordinate Transformation**:\n           - The transformation should correctly map the original coordinates to a new system where the rectangle sides are aligned with the slopes M and -1/M.\n           - The transformation equations used in the code might not be correctly aligning the rectangle.\n\n        3. **Perimeter Calculation**:\n           - The perimeter is calculated based on the transformed coordinates, but the transformation might not be correct, leading to incorrect perimeter values.\n\n        ### Mistakes in the Solution\n\n        1. **Incorrect Transformation**:\n           - The transformation equations used in the code might not correctly align the rectangle with the desired slope M.\n           - The transformation should consider the rotation of the coordinate system to align with the slope M.\n\n        2. **Perimeter Calculation**:\n           - The perimeter calculation assumes the transformed coordinates directly give the side lengths, which might not be the case if the transformation is incorrect.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        1. **Correct Transformation**:\n           - Use a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The rotation angle can be derived from the slope M.\n           - The angle \u03b8 can be calculated using `tan(\u03b8) = M`, and the rotation matrix can be used to transform the points.\n\n        2. **Calculate Bounds**:\n           - After transforming the points, calculate the minimum and maximum values in the new coordinate system to determine the bounds of the rectangle.\n\n        3. **Calculate Perimeter**:\n           - Use the bounds to calculate the side lengths and then the perimeter.\n\n        Let's correct the code with these considerations.\n\n        ```python\n        import sys\n        import math\n\n        def calculate_perimeter():\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            # Read N and M\n            index = 0\n            N = int(data[index])\n            M = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n    \n            # Calculate the angle of rotation\n            theta = math.atan(M)\n            cos_theta = math.cos(theta)\n            sin_theta = math.sin(theta)\n    \n            # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates\n            min_x_prime = float('inf')\n            max_x_prime = float('-inf')\n            min_y_prime = float('inf')\n            max_y_prime = float('-inf')\n    \n            # Process each point\n            for _ in range(N):\n                X = int(data[index])\n                Y = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                # Transform the coordinates using rotation\n                x_prime = X * cos_theta + Y * sin_theta\n                y_prime = -X * sin_theta + Y * cos_theta\n        \n                # Update min and max for transformed coordinates\n                min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)\n                max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)\n                min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)\n                max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)\n    \n            # Calculate the side lengths in the transformed space\n            length_x_prime = max_x_prime - min_x_prime\n            length_y_prime = max_y_prime - min_y_prime\n    \n            # Calculate the perimeter\n            perimeter = 2 * (length_x_prime + length_y_prime)\n    \n            # Print the perimeter with high precision\n            print(f\"{perimeter:.12f}\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute\n        calculate_perimeter()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Rotation Matrix**: The transformation uses a rotation matrix derived from the angle \u03b8, which is calculated using the slope M.\n        - **Coordinate Transformation**: Each point is transformed using the rotation matrix to align the rectangle with the slope M.\n        - **Perimeter Calculation**: The transformed coordinates are used to find the bounds, and the perimeter is calculated based on these bounds.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's fix the solution by correctly implementing the transformation using a rotation matrix to align the rectangle with the slope M.
