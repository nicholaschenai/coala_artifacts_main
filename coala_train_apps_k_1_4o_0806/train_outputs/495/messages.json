If the weights of the rocks are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If the weights are different, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. We need to determine the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock, or 0 if no rocks are left.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nThe problem is similar to a partition problem where we want to split the stones into two groups such that the difference between the sums of the two groups is minimized. This is because smashing two stones is equivalent to reducing the total weight by twice the weight of the smaller group.\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.\n2. Use dynamic programming to find the maximum possible sum of a subset of stones that does not exceed half of the total weight.\n3. The smallest possible weight of the last stone is the difference between the total weight and twice this maximum subset sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.\n2. Initialize a boolean DP array `dp` of size `total_weight // 2 + 1` with `dp[0] = True`.\n3. For each stone weight:\n   - Iterate backwards through the DP array from `total_weight // 2` to the stone weight.\n   - Update `dp[j]` to `True` if `dp[j - stone]` is `True`.\n4. Find the largest `j` for which `dp[j]` is `True`.\n5. Return `total_weight - 2 * j`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Calculate the total weight of all stones\n        total_weight = sum(stones)\n        \n        # The target is to find the maximum weight we can achieve that is <= total_weight // 2\n        target = total_weight // 2\n        \n        # Initialize a DP array where dp[i] means whether a sum of i can be achieved\n        dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # Base case: a sum of 0 is always achievable\n        \n        # Process each stone\n        for stone in stones:\n            # Update the dp array from back to front\n            for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n        \n        # Find the largest j for which dp[j] is True\n        for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n            if dp[j]:\n                # The smallest possible weight of the last stone\n                return total_weight - 2 * j\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the optimal way to partition the stones into two groups with minimal difference in their total weights. The time complexity is O(n * total_weight), where n is the number of stones."

programming}\n\n    \\key{Dynamic programming}\n    is a technique that combines the correctness\n    of complete search and the efficiency\n    of greedy algorithms.\n    Dynamic programming can be applied if the\n    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems\n    that can be solved independently.\n\n    There are two uses for dynamic programming:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item\n    \\key{Finding an optimal solution}:\n    We want to find a solution that is\n    as large as possible or as small as possible.\n    \\item\n    \\key{Counting the number of solutions}:\n    We want to calculate the total number of\n    possible solutions.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    We will first see how dynamic programming can\n    be used to find an optimal solution,\n    and then we will use the same idea for\n    counting the solutions.\n\n    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone\n    in every competitive programmer's career.\n    While the basic idea is simple,\n    the challenge is how to apply\n    dynamic programming to different problems.\n    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems\n    that are a good starting point.\n\n    \\section{Coin problem}\n\n    We first focus on a problem that we\n    have already seen in Chapter 6:\n    Given a set of coin values $\\texttt{coins} = \\{c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_k\\}$\n    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to\n    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.\n\n    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a\n    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest\n    possible coin.\n    The greedy algorithm works, for example,\n    when the coins are the euro coins,\n    but in the general case the greedy algorithm\n    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.\n\n    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently\n    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm\n    works for any coin set.\n    The dynamic programming\n    algorithm is based on a recursive function\n    that goes through all possibilities how to\n    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.\n    However, the dynamic programming\n    algorithm is efficient because\n    it uses \\emph{memoization} and\n    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Recursive formulation}\n\n    The idea in dynamic programming is to\n    formulate the problem recursively so\n    that the solution to the problem can be\n    calculated from solutions to smaller\n    subproblems.\n    In the coin problem, a natural recursive\n    problem is as follows:\n    what is the smallest number of coins\n    required to form a sum $x$?\n\n    Let $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    denote the minimum\n    number of coins required for a sum $x$.\n    The values of the function depend on the\n    values of the coins.\n    For example, if $\\texttt{coins} = \\{1,3,4\\}$,\n    the first values of the function are as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    \\texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    For example, $\\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,\n    because at least 3 coins are needed\n    to form the sum 10.\n    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.\n\n    The essential property of $\\texttt{solve}$ is\n    that its values can be\n    recursively calculated from its smaller values.\n    The idea is to focus on the \\emph{first}\n    coin that we choose for the sum.\n    For example, in the above scenario,\n    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.\n    If we first choose coin 1,\n    the remaining task is to form the sum 9\n    using the minimum number of coins,\n    which is a subproblem of the original problem.\n    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.\n    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula\n    to calculate the minimum number of coins:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\min( & \\texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).\n    \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case of the recursion is $\\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    For example,\n    \\[ \\texttt{solve}(10) = \\texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \\texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \\texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\\]\n\n    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function\n    that calculates the minimum number of\n    coins needed to form a sum $x$:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n                   \\infty               & x < 0\\\\\n                   0               & x = 0\\\\\n                   \\min_{c \\in \\texttt{coins}} \\texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n\n    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\\infty$,\n    because it is impossible to form a negative\n    sum of money.\n    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through\n    all possibilities how to choose the first coin\n    of the sum.\n\n    Once a recursive function that solves the problem\n    has been found,\n    we can directly implement a solution in C++\n    (the constant \\texttt{INF} denotes infinity):\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Still, this function is not efficient,\n    because there may be an exponential number of ways\n    to construct the sum.\n    However, next we will see how to make the\n    function efficient using a technique called memoization.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Using memoization}\n\n    \\index{memoization}\n\n    The idea of dynamic programming is to use\n    \\key{memoization} to efficiently calculate\n    values of a recursive function.\n    This means that the values of the function\n    are stored in an array after calculating them.\n    For each parameter, the value of the function\n    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,\n    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.\n\n    In this problem, we use arrays\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    bool ready[N];\n    int value[N];\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    where $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates\n    whether the value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,\n    and if it is, $\\texttt{value}[x]$\n    contains this value.\n    The constant $N$ has been chosen so\n    that all required values fit in the arrays.\n\n    Now the function can be efficiently\n    implemented as follows:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        if (ready[x]) return value[x];\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        value[x] = best;\n        ready[x] = true;\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function handles the base cases\n    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.\n    Then the function checks from\n    $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ if\n    $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored\n    in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    and if it is, the function directly returns it.\n    Otherwise the function calculates the value\n    of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    recursively and stores it in $\\texttt{value}[x]$.\n\n    This function works efficiently,\n    because the answer for each parameter $x$\n    is calculated recursively only once.\n    After a value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the\n    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.\n    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(nk)$,\n    where $n$ is the target sum and $k$ is the number of coins.\n\n    Note that we can also \\emph{iteratively}\n    construct the array \\texttt{value} using\n    a loop that simply calculates all the values\n    of $\\texttt{solve}$ for parameters $0 \\ldots n\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

This is a clever use of set operations to dynamically update possible sums without explicitly using a 2D array, which is common in traditional dynamic programming approaches.\n\n2. **Union Operation:**\n   - The line `dp |= {_sum + stone for _sum in dp}` efficiently updates the set of possible sums by adding the current stone's weight to each of the existing sums. This operation is both concise and powerful, leveraging Python's set operations to handle the dynamic programming state transitions.\n\n3. **Minimizing the Difference:**\n   - The final step involves calculating the minimum possible difference between the total weight and twice any achievable sum. This is done using the expression `min(abs(total - _sum - _sum) for _sum in dp)`, which directly computes the smallest possible weight of the last stone.\n\n### Comparison with My Approach:\n\n- **Efficiency and Simplicity:**\n  - The official solution is more efficient in terms of space complexity because it uses a set instead of a list, which avoids the need for a fixed-size array. This makes the solution more flexible and potentially faster due to the reduced overhead of managing a large array.\n  \n- **Elegance:**\n  - The use of set operations to manage the dynamic programming state is more elegant and concise compared to the traditional approach of using a boolean array. It reduces the complexity of the code and makes it easier to understand and maintain.\n\nOverall, the official solution is a great example of how leveraging Python's built-in data structures can lead to more efficient and elegant solutions. This experience highlights the importance of considering alternative data structures and operations when designing algorithms, especially in dynamic programming problems."
