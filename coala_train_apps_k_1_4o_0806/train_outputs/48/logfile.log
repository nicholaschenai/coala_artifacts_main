## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

You are playing a game where you start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. Specifically, you can:
- Trade 1 stick to get `x` sticks.
- Trade `y` sticks to get 1 coal.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches. You have `t` test cases to solve.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.
   - You start with 1 stick.

2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed:**
   - You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals.
   - Total sticks needed = `k + k * y`.

3. **Determine Trades for Sticks:**
   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k + k * y - 1` additional sticks.
   - Each trade for sticks gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick in the trade).
   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{trades\_for\_sticks} = \lceil \frac{k + k \cdot y - 1}{x - 1} \rceil
     \]
   - This can be computed using integer arithmetic as:
     \[
     \text{trades\_for\_sticks} = \frac{k + k \cdot y - 1 + (x - 2)}{x - 1}
     \]

4. **Calculate Trades for Coal:**
   - You need exactly `k` trades to get `k` coals.

5. **Total Trades:**
   - The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coal.

### Pseudocode

```
function minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        x, y, k = test_case
        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y
        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)
        trades_for_coal = k
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal
        append total_trades to results
    return results
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        x, y, k = test_cases[i]
        
        # Calculate total sticks needed
        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y
        
        # Calculate trades needed to get enough sticks
        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)
        
        # Calculate trades needed to get enough coal
        trades_for_coal = k
        
        # Total trades is the sum of both
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal
        
        results.append(total_trades)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# t = 5
# test_cases = [(2, 1, 5), (42, 13, 24), (12, 11, 12), (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000), (2, 1000000000, 1000000000)]
# print(minimum_trades(t, test_cases))
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and their respective parameters, calculates the minimum number of trades needed for each test case, and outputs the results.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal).

## Memories

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
        The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
        The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
        Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
        Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
        Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
        Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
        - The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
        - The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
        - The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
        - The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

        -----Output-----
        - In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
        - 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
        - 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
        - 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

        -----Subtasks-----
        - Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
        - Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        1
        4 2 2 
        5 7 6 1
        3 3 1 1
        6 3
        1 4

        Output:
        3

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1.
        In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
        Use black button 1 on the first day.
        Use black button 4 on the second day.
        Use white button 3 on the third day.
        The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
        5 7 3 1
        4 7 1 1
        So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

    [Previous Critique]:
        ### Analysis of the Problem

        The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

        1. **Understanding the Button Usage**:
           - **White Button**: Can only be used if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the button's value. It reduces the planned tasks.
           - **Black Button**: Can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks. It increases the completed tasks.

        2. **Logic Error**:
           - The current solution attempts to use the largest possible button for each day, but it doesn't correctly update the planned and completed tasks after using a button. This can lead to incorrect calculations of uncompleted tasks.

        3. **Negative Uncompleted Tasks**:
           - The output of `-2` suggests that the code is allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, which violates the problem constraints.

        ### Steps to Correct the Solution

        1. **Correct Button Application**:
           - Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
           - Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.

        2. **Re-evaluate the Greedy Approach**:
           - The greedy approach should be re-evaluated to ensure that it correctly minimizes uncompleted tasks without violating constraints.

        3. **Debugging**:
           - Add checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated after each button press.

        ### Revised Pseudocode

        ```
        function minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons = test_case
        
                sort white_buttons in descending order
                sort black_buttons in descending order
        
                for each day i from 0 to N-1:
                    for each white_button in white_buttons:
                        if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:
                            planned_tasks[i] -= white_button
                            remove white_button from white_buttons
                            break
            
                    for each black_button in black_buttons:
                        if completed_tasks[i] + black_button <= planned_tasks[i]:
                            completed_tasks[i] += black_button
                            remove black_button from black_buttons
                            break
        
                total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i] for i from 0 to N-1)
                print total_uncompleted_tasks
        ```

        ### Revised Python Code

        ```python
        def minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:

                # Sort buttons in descending order

                    # Try to use the largest possible white button
                    for j in range(len(white_buttons)):
                        if planned_tasks[i] >= white_buttons[j]:
                            planned_tasks[i] -= white_buttons[j]
                            white_buttons.pop(j)
                            break
            
                    # Try to use the largest possible black button

                            break
        
                # Calculate total uncompleted tasks
                total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i] for i in range(N))
                results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Read input

        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        test_cases = []

        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            M = int(data[index + 2])
            planned_tasks = list(map(int, data[index + 3:index + 3 + N]))
            completed_tasks = list(map(int, data[index + 3 + N:index + 3 + 2 * N]))
            white_buttons = list(map(int, data[index + 3 + 2 * N:index + 3 + 2 * N + K]))
            black_buttons = list(map(int, data[index + 3 + 2 * N + K:index + 3 + 2 * N + K + M]))
            index += 3 + 2 * N + K + M
            test_cases.append((N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons))

        minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
        ```

        This revised code should correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons, ensuring that the number of uncompleted tasks is minimized without violating any constraints.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's address the issue in the previous solution by ensuring that the constraints are properly handled and the logic for using the buttons is correctly implemented. Here's the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                N, K, M, planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons = test_case
        
                # Sort buttons in descending order
                white_buttons.sort(reverse=True)
                black_buttons.sort(reverse=True)
        
                # Process each day
                for i in range(N):
                    # Try to use the largest possible white button
                    for j in range(len(white_buttons)):
                        if planned_tasks[i] >= white_buttons[j]:

        minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
        ```

        ### Key Fixes:
        - **Correct Button Usage**: Ensure that after using a button, the planned and completed tasks are updated correctly.
        - **Constraint Handling**: Ensure that the constraints are strictly followed: completed tasks should never exceed planned tasks.
        - **Greedy Approach**: The greedy approach is maintained but with careful checks to ensure that the constraints are not violated.

        This code should now correctly handle the constraints and logic for using the buttons, ensuring that the number of uncompleted tasks is minimized without violating any constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

You start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade:
- 1 stick for `x` sticks.
- `y` sticks for 1 coal.

You need to determine the minimum number of trades required to craft at least `k` torches. You have `t` test cases to solve.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.
   - You start with 1 stick.

2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed**:
   - You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals.
   - Total sticks needed = `k + k * y`.

3. **Determine Trades for Sticks**:
   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `total_sticks_needed - 1` additional sticks.
   - Each trade gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick to gain `x` sticks).
   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{trades\_for\_sticks} = \lceil \frac{\text{total\_sticks\_needed} - 1}{x - 1} \rceil
     \]

4. **Determine Trades for Coals**:
   - You need exactly `k` trades to get `k` coals since each trade gives you 1 coal.

5. **Total Trades**:
   - The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coals.

## Pseudocode

```
function minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        x, y, k = test_case
        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y
        trades_for_sticks = ceil((total_sticks_needed - 1) / (x - 1))
        trades_for_coals = k
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coals
        results.append(total_trades)
    return results
```

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of trades required to craft a specified number of torches, given specific trading rules for sticks and coal. The core concept involved calculating the total number of sticks needed and determining how many trades are required to acquire those sticks and the necessary coal.

The key steps involved:
1. Calculating the total number of sticks needed, which includes both the sticks for the torches and the sticks needed to trade for coal.
2. Determining the number of trades required to gather the necessary sticks, using integer division and ceiling logic to account for any remainder.
3. Adding the number of trades needed to acquire the required coal, which is straightforward since each trade yields exactly one coal.

The solution involved careful arithmetic to ensure that the calculations for trades were accurate, especially when dealing with large numbers. The use of integer division and conditional incrementing for ceiling logic was crucial in ensuring the correct number of trades was calculated.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and using efficient arithmetic operations to handle potentially large input sizes. The solution was implemented successfully, passing all test cases without errors.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

You start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade:
- 1 stick for `x` sticks.
- `y` sticks for 1 coal.

You need to determine the minimum number of trades required to craft at least `k` torches. You have `t` test cases to solve.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.
   - You start with 1 stick.

2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed**:
   - You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals.
   - Total sticks needed = `k + k * y`.

3. **Determine Trades for Sticks**:
   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `total_sticks_needed - 1` additional sticks.
   - Each trade gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick to gain `x` sticks).
   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{trades\_for\_sticks} = \lceil \frac{\text{total\_sticks\_needed} - 1}{x - 1} \rceil
     \]

4. **Determine Trades for Coals**:
   - You need exactly `k` trades to get `k` coals since each trade gives you 1 coal.

5. **Total Trades**:
   - The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coals.

## Pseudocode

```
function minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        x, y, k = test_case
        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y
        trades_for_sticks = ceil((total_sticks_needed - 1) / (x - 1))
        trades_for_coals = k
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coals
        results.append(total_trades)
    return results
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x, y, k in test_cases:
        # Calculate total sticks needed
        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y
        
        # Calculate trades needed for sticks
        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1) // (x - 1)
        if (total_sticks_needed - 1) % (x - 1) != 0:
            trades_for_sticks += 1
        
        # Calculate trades needed for coals
        trades_for_coals = k
        
        # Total trades
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coals
        results.append(total_trades)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []

for _ in range(t):
    x = int(data[index])
    y = int(data[index + 1])
    k = int(data[index + 2])
    test_cases.append((x, y, k))
    index += 3

# Get results
results = minimum_trades(t, test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case to calculate the minimum number of trades required, and outputs the result for each test case.

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for haaghfj in range(int(input())):
    x,y,k = list(map(int,input().split()))
    print(k + (y * k + k - 1 +x-2) // (x - 1))


INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] The problem was a straightforward application of arithmetic and logical reasoning to determine the minimum number of trades required to craft a given number of torches. My solution and the official solution both arrived at the correct answer, but the official solution is more concise.

### Key Insights:

1. **Understanding the Requirements**:
   - Both solutions correctly identified the need for `k` sticks and `k` coals to craft `k` torches.
   - The total number of sticks required is `k + k * y`.

2. **Trade Calculations**:
   - The official solution uses a single line to calculate the total number of trades, which is a more compact representation of the logic.
   - The formula `(y * k + k - 1 + x - 2) // (x - 1)` effectively calculates the number of trades needed for sticks using integer division, which is equivalent to the ceiling operation I used.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space, as it directly computes the result without additional variables or loops.

### Reflection:

The official solution is a good example of how to condense logic into a single line while maintaining clarity. It uses integer arithmetic cleverly to avoid explicit ceiling calculations, which is a useful technique in competitive programming. This experience reinforces the importance of simplifying expressions and leveraging integer division properties to achieve concise and efficient solutions.

The main function is `minimum_trades`.
INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] The function calculates the minimum number of trades required for each test case to obtain a specified number of coals and sticks. For each test case, it determines the total number of sticks needed by considering both the number of coals and the number of sticks required per coal. It then calculates the number of trades needed to acquire the necessary sticks, taking into account the number of sticks obtained per trade. The function also accounts for the trades needed to acquire the specified number of coals. Finally, it sums the trades for sticks and coals to determine the total trades required for each test case and returns a list of these totals.

[Problem]
    You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

    Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

    During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

    Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

    You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


    -----Input-----

    The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

    The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.
