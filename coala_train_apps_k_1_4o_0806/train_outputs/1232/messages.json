Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.\n\nYou are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.\n\nNow consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).\n\nEach test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.\n\nAs stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.\n\nTest cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n1 1 2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2 1 2\n\n5\n0\n0\n0\n2 1 2\n1 3 4\n\nOutput:\n\n0.50000\n0.29289\n0.70711\n0.40303\n\n-----Temporary Stuff-----\n\nA horizontal rule follows.\n\n***\n\nHere's a definition list (with `definitionLists` option):\n\napples\n: Good for making applesauce.\noranges\n: Citrus!\ntomatoes\n: There's no \"e\" in tomatoe.\n\n#PRACTICE\n- This must be done\n[http:codechef.com/users/dpraveen](http:codechef.com/users/dpraveen)\n\n(0.8944272\u22120.44721360.4472136\u22120.8944272)(10005)(0.89442720.4472136\u22120.4472136\u22120.8944272)(10005)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n0.8944272 & 0.4472136\\\\\n-0.4472136 & -0.8944272\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n10 & 0\\\\ \n0 & 5\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output of the circuit is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND or OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.\n\n2. **Probability Calculation**: For each node, calculate the probability that it outputs 1. For input nodes, this is simply `p`. For OR gates, the probability is `1 - (1 - P(a)) * (1 - P(b))`, where `P(a)` and `P(b)` are the probabilities that the inputs to the gate are 1. For AND gates, the probability is `P(a) * P(b)`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for `p`**: Use binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. Start with `p` in the range [0, 1] and iteratively adjust based on the calculated probability of the output node.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_p_for_half_probability(test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        n = number of nodes\n        nodes = list of node descriptions\n        \n        define function calculate_probability(p):\n            probabilities = array of size n\n            for i from 0 to n-1:\n                if nodes[i] is input:\n                    probabilities[i] = p\n                else if nodes[i] is OR gate:\n                    a, b = inputs to the gate\n                    probabilities[i] = 1 - (1 - probabilities[a]) * (1 - probabilities[b])\n                else if nodes[i] is AND gate:\n                    a, b = inputs to the gate\n                    probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n            return probabilities[n-1]\n        \n        low = 0.0\n        high = 1.0\n        while high - low > 1e-6:\n            mid = (low + high) / 2\n            if calculate_probability(mid) < 0.5:\n                low = mid\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        \n        print the value of p with 5 decimal places\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_p_for_half_probability(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for nodes in test_cases:\n        n = len(nodes)\n        \n        def calculate_probability(p):\n            probabilities = [0] * n\n            for i in range(n):\n                if nodes[i][0] == 0:  # Input node\n                    probabilities[i] = p\n                elif nodes[i][0] == 1:  # OR gate\n                    a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]\n                    probabilities[i] = 1 - (1 - probabilities[a]) * (1 - probabilities[b])\n                elif nodes[i][0] == 2:  # AND gate\n                    a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]\n                    probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n            return probabilities[-1]\n        \n        low, high = 0.0, 1.0\n        while high - low > 1e-6:\n            mid = (low + high) / 2\n            if calculate_probability(mid) < 0.5:\n                low = mid\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        \n        results.append(f\"{low:.5f}\")\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# test_cases = [\n#     [(0,)],  # Single input node\n#     [(0,), (0,), (1, 1, 2)],  # OR gate\n#     [(0,), (0,), (2, 1, 2)],  # AND gate\n#     [(0,), (0,), (0,), (2, 1, 2), (1, 3, 4)]  # Mixed gates\n# ]\n# print(find_p_for_half_probability(test_cases))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `find_p_for_half_probability` that takes a list of test cases, each representing a circuit, and returns the value of `p` for each circuit such that the output node has a probability of 1/2.

It also handles blank lines between test cases.\n\n3. **Processing Each Test Case**:\n   - The code reads the number of nodes and then reads each node's description.\n   - It stores the node information in a list called `nodes`.\n\n4. **Binary Search for `p`**:\n   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.\n   - It calculates the probability of each node being 1 using the `calculate_probability` function.\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - The code stores the result for each test case and prints it with 5 decimal places.\n\n### Where the Code Went Wrong\n\n1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but never called.

Ensuring the function is executed is a basic but crucial step.\n    - **Output Verification**: Ensuring that results are printed correctly after processing all test cases was necessary to match expected outputs.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of efficient input handling and careful index management in array-based problems.

It also handles blank lines between test cases.\n\n3. **Processing Each Test Case**:\n   - The code reads the number of nodes and then reads each node's description.\n   - It stores the node information in a list called `nodes`.\n\n4. **Binary Search for `p`**:\n   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.\n   - It calculates the probability of each node being 1 using the `calculate_probability` function.\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - The code stores the result for each test case and prints it with 5 decimal places.\n\n### Where the Code Went Wrong\n\n1. **Probability Calculation**: The logic for calculating the probability of the output node being 1 is incorrect for some cases.

This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.\n\n    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.\n\n    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.\n\n    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The circuit is composed of AND and OR gates, and the task is to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 0.5 of being 1. This problem tests understanding of probability propagation through logical gates and the use of binary search to find a specific probability value.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\n1. **Probability Calculation**: The key challenge was correctly calculating the probability of the output node for both AND and OR gates. The formula for OR gates is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`, and for AND gates, it is `P(a) * P(b)`. Ensuring these calculations were correctly implemented was crucial.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: The use of binary search to find the correct `p` was a suitable strategy. However, ensuring the search adjusted `low` and `high` correctly based on the calculated probability was essential. The precision of the search (`epsilon`) needed to be fine enough to ensure accurate results.\n\n3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the output was formatted to exactly 5 decimal places was a straightforward requirement but important for passing the tests.\n\n#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n- **Function Call**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was a simple oversight but critical to fix.\n- **Probability Miscalculations**: There were issues with the probability calculations for certain test cases, particularly with OR gates. Ensuring the logic was correctly implemented for all scenarios was necessary.\n- **Binary Search Adjustments**: The binary search needed careful adjustment to ensure it converged on the correct value of `p` that resulted in a 0.5 probability for the output node.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of careful probability calculations and the effective use of binary search in probabilistic scenarios."

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Node Representation**: The official solution uses a class `node` to represent each node in the circuit. This encapsulates the type of node (input, AND, OR) and its connections, which is a clean and organized way to handle the circuit structure.\n\n2. **Recursive Probability Calculation**: The `finder` function is a recursive function that calculates the probability of a node being 1. It traverses the circuit from the output node back to the inputs, applying the probability rules for AND and OR gates. This recursive approach is elegant and simplifies the logic for calculating probabilities.\n\n3. **Binary Search for `p`**: The solution uses binary search to find the value of `p` that results in the output node having a probability of 0.5. The precision is controlled by a small epsilon (`1e-9`), ensuring accurate results.\n\n4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The solution efficiently handles multiple test cases by resetting the node array `arr` after each test case, ensuring no interference between test cases.\n\n#### Why My Approach Failed\n\n- **Probability Calculation**: My approach used a similar logic for calculating probabilities, but the implementation might have had subtle errors in handling the recursive dependencies between nodes, especially in complex circuits.\n\n- **Binary Search Precision**: The precision of the binary search in my solution might not have been sufficient, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.\n\n- **State Management**: The official solution's use of a class to encapsulate node information and the recursive function to calculate probabilities provided a more robust and error-free approach compared to my list-based implementation.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Use of Classes**: Encapsulating related data and functionality in a class can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code, especially in complex problems like circuit simulation.\n\n- **Recursive Functions**: Recursive functions can simplify the logic for problems that involve traversing hierarchical structures, such as circuits or trees.\n\n- **Precision in Numerical Methods**: When using numerical methods like binary search, it's crucial to ensure that the precision is sufficient to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of clear data structures and precise numerical methods in solving complex algorithmic challenges."
