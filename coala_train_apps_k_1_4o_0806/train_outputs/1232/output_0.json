    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND/OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.\n\n2. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.\n   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.\n   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. We can use binary search over `p` in the range [0, 1] to find this value.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Parse the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Parse the number of nodes.\n   - Initialize a list to store the probability of each node being 1.\n   - For each node, determine if it's an input or a gate and store the necessary information.\n   - Use binary search to find the value of `p`:\n     - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 1.\n     - While the difference between `low` and `high` is greater than a small epsilon (e.g., 1e-6):\n       - Set `mid` to the average of `low` and `high`.\n       - Calculate the probability of each node being 1 using `mid` as the probability for input nodes.\n       - If the probability of the output node is greater than 0.5, set `high` to `mid`.\n       - Otherwise, set `low` to `mid`.\n   - The value of `p` is the average of `low` and `high`.\n3. Print the value of `p` for each test case with 5 decimal places.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):\n    probabilities = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if nodes[i][0] == 0:\n            probabilities[i] = p\n        elif nodes[i][0] == 1:\n            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]\n            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] + probabilities[b] - probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:\n            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]\n            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n    return probabilities[-1]\n\ndef find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes):\n    low, high = 0.0, 1.0\n    epsilon = 1e-7\n    while high - low > epsilon:\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if calculate_probability(n, nodes, mid) > 0.5:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid\n    return (low + high) / 2\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split('\\n')\n    \n    index = 0\n    num_cases = int(data[index].strip())\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(num_cases):\n        if data[index].strip() == \"\":\n            index += 1\n        \n        n = int(data[index].strip())\n        index += 1\n        \n        nodes = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            line = list(map(int, data[index].strip().split()))\n            nodes.append(line)\n            index += 1\n        \n        p = find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes)\n        results.append(f\"{p:.5f}\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```",
