INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a given set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to a given number \( M \). The task is to compute this perimeter with high precision.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope \( M \):**
   - A line with slope \( M \) can be represented as \( y = Mx + c \).
   - For a rectangle with one side having this slope, the opposite side will have the same slope, and the other two sides will have a slope of \(-1/M\) (perpendicular).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System:**
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope \( M \). This can be achieved using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: \( x' = x \cos(\theta) + y \sin(\theta) \)
     - New y-coordinate: \( y' = -x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta) \)
   - Here, \(\theta\) is the angle whose tangent is \( M \), i.e., \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).

3. **Finding the Bounding Rectangle:**
   - After transformation, find the minimum and maximum values of the new x and y coordinates.
   - The width of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
   - The height of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum transformed x and y coordinates.
3. For each point:
   - Compute the angle \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).
   - Transform the point using the rotation formulas.
   - Update the minimum and maximum transformed x and y coordinates.
4. Calculate the width and height of the bounding rectangle.
5. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

## Python Code

```python
import sys
import math

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = float(data[1])
    
    # Calculate the angle theta
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates
    min_x_prime = float('inf')
    max_x_prime = float('-inf')
    min_y_prime = float('inf')
    max_y_prime = float('-inf')
    
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = float(data[index])
        y = float(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Transform the coordinates
        x_prime = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta
        y_prime = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
        
        # Update min and max for x' and y'
        if x_prime < min_x_prime:
            min_x_prime = x_prime
        if x_prime > max_x_prime:
            max_x_prime = x_prime
        if y_prime < min_y_prime:
            min_y_prime = y_prime
        if y_prime > max_y_prime:
            max_y_prime = y_prime
    
    # Calculate width and height of the rectangle
    width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
    height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    
    # Print the result with high precision
    print(f"{perimeter:.12f}")

main()
```

This code reads the input, transforms the coordinates to align with the slope \( M \), calculates the bounding rectangle, and outputs the perimeter with high precision.

        ### Analysis of the Problem

        The issue seems to be related to the way the input is being handled and possibly the function calls. Let's break down the potential issues:

        1. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which reads all input at once. This is correct for competitive programming environments, but we need to ensure that the input is being parsed correctly.

        2. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script that reads from standard input, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.

        3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This is correct, but we need to ensure that the `print` statements are executed.

        ### Steps to Correct the Code

        1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.

        2. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check that the input parsing logic correctly handles the input format and converts indices to zero-based correctly.

        3. **Output the Results**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

        ### Revised Python Solution

        ```python
        def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
            # Initialize scores for each student
            scores = [10] * N
    
            # Process each question
            for i, j, k in questions:
                for student in range(i, j + 1):
                    scores[student] *= k
    
            # Calculate the mean of the scores
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
            return mean_score

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                M = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                questions = []
                for _ in range(M):
                    i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
                    j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
                    k = int(data[index + 2])
                    index += 3
                    questions.append((i, j, k))
        
                result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the main function to execute the program
        main()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes

        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `main()` at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
        - **Input Parsing**: Ensured that the input is parsed correctly and indices are converted to zero-based.
        - **Output**: The results are printed after processing all test cases, ensuring the output is as expected.

        Let's address the issue by ensuring the `main()` function is called and the input is handled correctly. Here's the corrected Python code:

                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the main function to execute the program
        main()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes

        - **Function Call**: The `main()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
        - **Input Parsing**: The input is read in bulk and parsed correctly, converting indices to zero-based as needed.
        - **Output**: The results are printed after processing all test cases, ensuring the output is as expected. 

        This should resolve the issue of the script not producing any output.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of given points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to Chef's favorite number, M. The task is to find the minimum perimeter of such a rectangle that covers all the points.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**: 
   - A line with slope M can be represented as `y = Mx + c`. For a rectangle, we need two parallel lines with this slope and two perpendicular lines.
   - The perpendicular slope to M is `-1/M` (assuming M is not zero).

2. **Bounding the Points**:
   - Transform the coordinates of the points to a new coordinate system where the axes are aligned with the slopes M and -1/M.
   - This transformation can be done using a rotation matrix or by directly computing the new coordinates.

3. **Finding the Bounds**:
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates to determine the bounds of the rectangle in this new coordinate system.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter**:
   - The length of the rectangle sides in the transformed coordinate system can be calculated using the differences in the min and max values.
   - Convert these lengths back to the original coordinate system to calculate the actual perimeter.

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values for N and M.
2. Initialize variables to store the minimum and maximum transformed coordinates.
3. For each point (X, Y):
   - Transform the point using the equations:
     - `X' = X + M * Y`
     - `Y' = -1/M * X + Y` (if M is not zero)
   - Update the min and max values for X' and Y'.
4. Calculate the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.
5. Convert these lengths back to the original space to find the perimeter.
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

## Python Code

```python
def calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read N and M
    index = 0
    N = int(data[index])
    M = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    
    # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates
    min_x_prime = float('inf')
    max_x_prime = float('-inf')
    min_y_prime = float('inf')
    max_y_prime = float('-inf')
    
    # Process each point
    for _ in range(N):

 ## Problem Restatement

Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of given points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to Chef's favorite number, M. The task is to find the minimum perimeter of such a rectangle that covers all the points.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**: 
   - A line with slope M can be represented as `y = Mx + c`. For a rectangle, we need two parallel lines with this slope and two perpendicular lines.
   - The perpendicular slope to M is `-1/M` (assuming M is not zero).

2. **Bounding the Points**:
   - Transform the coordinates of the points to a new coordinate system where the axes are aligned with the slopes M and -1/M.
   - This transformation can be done using a rotation matrix or by directly computing the new coordinates.

3. **Finding the Bounds**:
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates to determine the bounds of the rectangle in this new coordinate system.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter**:
   - The length of the rectangle sides in the transformed coordinate system can be calculated using the differences in the min and max values.
   - Convert these lengths back to the original coordinate system to calculate the actual perimeter.

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values for N and M.
2. Initialize variables to store the minimum and maximum transformed coordinates.
3. For each point (X, Y):
   - Transform the point using the equations:
     - `X' = X + M * Y`
     - `Y' = -1/M * X + Y` (if M is not zero)
   - Update the min and max values for X' and Y'.
4. Calculate the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.
5. Convert these lengths back to the original space to find the perimeter.
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

## Python Code

```python
def calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read N and M

    index += 2

    min_x_prime = float('inf')
    max_x_prime = float('-inf')
    min_y_prime = float('inf')
    max_y_prime = float('-inf')
    
    # Process each point
    for _ in range(N):
        X = int(data[index])
        Y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Transform the coordinates
        x_prime = X + M * Y
        y_prime = -1/M * X + Y if M != 0 else Y
        
        # Update min and max for transformed coordinates
        min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
        max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
        min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
        max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
    
    # Calculate the side lengths in the transformed space
    length_x_prime = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
    length_y_prime = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (length_x_prime + length_y_prime)
    
    # Print the perimeter with high precision

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the code went wrong.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**:
   - The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope M. This means the rectangle is not axis-aligned but rotated.
   - The transformation of coordinates should align the rectangle with the slope M and its perpendicular.

2. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - The transformation should correctly map the original coordinates to a new system where the rectangle sides are aligned with the slopes M and -1/M.
   - The transformation equations used in the code might not be correctly aligning the rectangle.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter is calculated based on the transformed coordinates, but the transformation might not be correct, leading to incorrect perimeter values.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Transformation**:
   - The transformation equations used in the code might not correctly align the rectangle with the desired slope M.
   - The transformation should consider the rotation of the coordinate system to align with the slope M.

2. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter calculation assumes the transformed coordinates directly give the side lengths, which might not be the case if the transformation is incorrect.

### Correct Approach

1. **Correct Transformation**:
   - Use a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The rotation angle can be derived from the slope M.
   - The angle Î¸ can be calculated using `tan(Î¸) = M`, and the rotation matrix can be used to transform the points.

2. **Calculate Bounds**:
   - After transforming the points, calculate the minimum and maximum values in the new coordinate system to determine the bounds of the rectangle.

3. **Calculate Perimeter**:
   - Use the bounds to calculate the side lengths and then the perimeter.

Let's correct the code with these considerations.

```python
import sys
import math

def calculate_perimeter():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read N and M
    index = 0
    N = int(data[index])
    M = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    
    # Calculate the angle of rotation
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates
    min_x_prime = float('inf')
    max_x_prime = float('-inf')
    min_y_prime = float('inf')
    max_y_prime = float('-inf')
    
    # Process each point
    for _ in range(N):
        X = int(data[index])
        Y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Transform the coordinates using rotation
        x_prime = X * cos_theta + Y * sin_theta
        y_prime = -X * sin_theta + Y * cos_theta
        
        # Update min and max for transformed coordinates
        min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
        max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
        min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
        max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
    
    # Calculate the side lengths in the transformed space
    length_x_prime = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
    length_y_prime = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (length_x_prime + length_y_prime)
    
    # Print the perimeter with high precision
    print(f"{perimeter:.12f}")

# Call the function to execute
calculate_perimeter()
```

### Explanation

- **Rotation Matrix**: The transformation uses a rotation matrix derived from the angle Î¸, which is calculated using the slope M.
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Each point is transformed using the rotation matrix to align the rectangle with the slope M.
- **Perimeter Calculation**: The transformed coordinates are used to find the bounds, and the perimeter is calculated based on these bounds.

   - Transform the coordinates of the points to a new coordinate system where the axes are aligned with the slopes M and -1/M.
   - This transformation can be done using a rotation matrix or by directly computing the new coordinates.

3. **Finding the Bounds**:
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates to determine the bounds of the rectangle in this new coordinate system.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter**:
   - The length of the rectangle sides in the transformed coordinate system can be calculated using the differences in the min and max values.
   - Convert these lengths back to the original coordinate system to calculate the actual perimeter.

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values for N and M.
2. Initialize variables to store the minimum and maximum transformed coordinates.
3. For each point (X, Y):
   - Transform the point using the equations:
     - `X' = X + M * Y`
     - `Y' = -1/M * X + Y` (if M is not zero)
   - Update the min and max values for X' and Y'.
4. Calculate the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.
5. Convert these lengths back to the original space to find the perimeter.
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

## Python Code

```python
def calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read N and M
    index = 0
    N = int(data[index])
    M = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    
    # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates
    min_x_prime = float('inf')
    max_x_prime = float('-inf')
    min_y_prime = float('inf')
    max_y_prime = float('-inf')
    
    # Process each point
    for _ in range(N):
        X = int(data[index])
        Y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Transform the coordinates
        x_prime = X + M * Y
        y_prime = -1/M * X + Y if M != 0 else Y
        
        # Update min and max for transformed coordinates
        min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
        max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
        min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
        max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
    
    # Calculate the side lengths in the transformed space
    length_x_prime = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
    length_y_prime = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (length_x_prime + length_y_prime)
    
    # Print the perimeter with high precision
    print(f"{perimeter:.12f}")

# Call the function to execute
calculate_perimeter(0, 0, [])
```

This code reads the input, transforms the points, calculates the bounds in the transformed space, and then computes the perimeter of the rectangle that covers all points. The result is printed with a precision that ensures the error is less than \(10^{-6}\).

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the code went wrong.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**:
   - The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope M. This means the rectangle is not axis-aligned but rotated.
   - The transformation of coordinates should align the rectangle with the slope M and its perpendicular.

2. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - The transformation should correctly map the original coordinates to a new system where the rectangle sides are aligned with the slopes M and -1/M.
   - The transformation equations used in the code might not be correctly aligning the rectangle.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter is calculated based on the transformed coordinates, but the transformation might not be correct, leading to incorrect perimeter values.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Transformation**:
   - The transformation equations used in the code might not correctly align the rectangle with the desired slope M.
   - The transformation should consider the rotation of the coordinate system to align with the slope M.

2. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter calculation assumes the transformed coordinates directly give the side lengths, which might not be the case if the transformation is incorrect.

### Correct Approach

1. **Correct Transformation**:
   - Use a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The rotation angle can be derived from the slope M.
   - The angle Î¸ can be calculated using `tan(Î¸) = M`, and the rotation matrix can be used to transform the points.

2. **Calculate Bounds**:
   - After transforming the points, calculate the minimum and maximum values in the new coordinate system to determine the bounds of the rectangle.

3. **Calculate Perimeter**:
   - Use the bounds to calculate the side lengths and then the perimeter.

Let's correct the code with these considerations.

```python
import sys
import math

def calculate_perimeter():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read N and M

    M = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    
    # Calculate the angle of rotation
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates

        index += 2
        
        # Transform the coordinates using rotation
        x_prime = X * cos_theta + Y * sin_theta
        y_prime = -X * sin_theta + Y * cos_theta
        
        # Update min and max for transformed coordinates
        min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
        max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
        min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
        max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
    
    # Calculate the side lengths in the transformed space
    length_x_prime = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
    length_y_prime = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (length_x_prime + length_y_prime)
    
    # Print the perimeter with high precision

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this permutation problem, there are several key insights and lessons learned:

    1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem involves finding a permutation of numbers that satisfies a specific sum condition. The constraints on the sum, derived from the properties of permutations, are crucial for determining if a solution is possible. The official solution effectively uses these constraints to quickly rule out impossible cases.

    2. **Efficient Input/Output Handling**: Given the large potential size of input and output, efficient handling using `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` is necessary. This was a point of improvement in my initial solution, which was corrected in the final version.

    3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution uses a systematic approach to construct the permutation by starting from a known configuration (ascending order) and making adjustments to reach the desired sum. This involves understanding the maximum and minimum possible values of the function f(P) and adjusting the permutation accordingly.

    4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution iteratively adjusts the permutation to achieve the desired sum by swapping elements. This is a more structured approach compared to my initial attempt, which was less systematic in handling the adjustments.

    5. **Edge Cases**: Handling edge cases, such as when N is 1 or when the desired sum is exactly the minimum or maximum possible, is crucial. The official solution includes specific checks for these scenarios, ensuring robustness.

    Overall, the experience highlighted the importance of understanding problem constraints, efficient I/O handling, and systematic approaches to constructing solutions. These insights are valuable for tackling similar permutation and combinatorial problems in the future.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of given points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to Chef's favorite number, M. The task is to find the minimum perimeter of such a rectangle that covers all the points.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**: 
   - A line with slope M can be represented as `y = Mx + c`. For a rectangle, we need two parallel lines with this slope and two perpendicular lines.
   - The perpendicular slope to M is `-1/M` (assuming M is not zero).

2. **Bounding the Points**:
   - Transform the coordinates of the points to a new coordinate system where the axes are aligned with the slopes M and -1/M.
   - This transformation can be done using a rotation matrix or by directly computing the new coordinates.

3. **Finding the Bounds**:
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates to determine the bounds of the rectangle in this new coordinate system.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter**:
   - The length of the rectangle sides in the transformed coordinate system can be calculated using the differences in the min and max values.
   - Convert these lengths back to the original coordinate system to calculate the actual perimeter.

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values for N and M.
2. Initialize variables to store the minimum and maximum transformed coordinates.
3. For each point (X, Y):
   - Transform the point using the equations:
     - `X' = X + M * Y`
     - `Y' = -1/M * X + Y` (if M is not zero)
   - Update the min and max values for X' and Y'.
4. Calculate the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.
5. Convert these lengths back to the original space to find the perimeter.
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the code went wrong.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**:
   - The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope M. This means the rectangle is not axis-aligned but rotated.
   - The transformation of coordinates should align the rectangle with the slope M and its perpendicular.

2. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - The transformation should correctly map the original coordinates to a new system where the rectangle sides are aligned with the slopes M and -1/M.
   - The transformation equations used in the code might not be correctly aligning the rectangle.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter is calculated based on the transformed coordinates, but the transformation might not be correct, leading to incorrect perimeter values.

### Mistakes in the Solution

1. **Incorrect Transformation**:
   - The transformation equations used in the code might not correctly align the rectangle with the desired slope M.
   - The transformation should consider the rotation of the coordinate system to align with the slope M.

2. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter calculation assumes the transformed coordinates directly give the side lengths, which might not be the case if the transformation is incorrect.

### Correct Approach

1. **Correct Transformation**:
   - Use a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The rotation angle can be derived from the slope M.
   - The angle Î¸ can be calculated using `tan(Î¸) = M`, and the rotation matrix can be used to transform the points.

2. **Calculate Bounds**:
   - After transforming the points, calculate the minimum and maximum values in the new coordinate system to determine the bounds of the rectangle.

3. **Calculate Perimeter**:
   - Use the bounds to calculate the side lengths and then the perimeter.

Let's correct the code with these considerations.

```python
import sys
import math

def calculate_perimeter():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read N and M
    index = 0
    N = int(data[index])
    M = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    
    # Calculate the angle of rotation
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates
    min_x_prime = float('inf')
    max_x_prime = float('-inf')
    min_y_prime = float('inf')
    max_y_prime = float('-inf')
    
    # Process each point
    for _ in range(N):
        X = int(data[index])
        Y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Transform the coordinates using rotation
        x_prime = X * cos_theta + Y * sin_theta
        y_prime = -X * sin_theta + Y * cos_theta
        
        # Update min and max for transformed coordinates
        min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
        max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
        min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
        max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
    
    # Calculate the side lengths in the transformed space
    length_x_prime = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
    length_y_prime = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (length_x_prime + length_y_prime)
    
    # Print the perimeter with high precision
    print(f"{perimeter:.12f}")

# Call the function to execute

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] In tackling the problem of finding the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that covers a set of points with one side having a specific slope, the core concept was understanding how to transform the coordinate system to align with the given slope. The problem required using a rotation matrix to correctly transform the points, which was a key insight.

Initially, the transformation was incorrectly handled, leading to incorrect perimeter calculations. The correct approach involved calculating the angle of rotation using the arctangent of the slope M, and then applying a rotation matrix to each point. This transformation aligned the rectangle with the desired slope, allowing for accurate calculation of the bounding rectangle's dimensions in the transformed space.

The main takeaway is the importance of correctly applying geometric transformations when dealing with rotated coordinate systems. The use of trigonometric functions to derive the rotation matrix was crucial. This experience reinforced the need to carefully consider the mathematical foundations when dealing with geometric problems, especially those involving rotations and transformations. The final solution successfully calculated the perimeter with high precision, meeting the problem's requirements.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of given points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to Chef's favorite number, M. The task is to find the minimum perimeter of such a rectangle that covers all the points.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**: 
   - A line with slope M can be represented as `y = Mx + c`. For a rectangle, we need two parallel lines with this slope and two perpendicular lines.
   - The perpendicular slope to M is `-1/M` (assuming M is not zero).

2. **Bounding the Points**:
   - Transform the coordinates of the points to a new coordinate system where the axes are aligned with the slopes M and -1/M.
   - This transformation can be done using a rotation matrix or by directly computing the new coordinates.

3. **Finding the Bounds**:
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates to determine the bounds of the rectangle in this new coordinate system.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter**:
   - The length of the rectangle sides in the transformed coordinate system can be calculated using the differences in the min and max values.
   - Convert these lengths back to the original coordinate system to calculate the actual perimeter.

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values for N and M.
2. Initialize variables to store the minimum and maximum transformed coordinates.
3. For each point (X, Y):
   - Transform the point using the equations:
     - `X' = X + M * Y`
     - `Y' = -1/M * X + Y` (if M is not zero)
   - Update the min and max values for X' and Y'.
4. Calculate the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.
5. Convert these lengths back to the original space to find the perimeter.
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

## Python Code

```python
def calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read N and M
    index = 0
    N = int(data[index])
    M = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    
    # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates
    min_x_prime = float('inf')
    max_x_prime = float('-inf')
    min_y_prime = float('inf')
    max_y_prime = float('-inf')
    
    # Process each point
    for _ in range(N):
        X = int(data[index])
        Y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Transform the coordinates
        x_prime = X + M * Y
        y_prime = -1/M * X + Y if M != 0 else Y
        
        # Update min and max for transformed coordinates
        min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
        max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
        min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
        max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
    
    # Calculate the side lengths in the transformed space
    length_x_prime = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
    length_y_prime = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (length_x_prime + length_y_prime)
    
    # Print the perimeter with high precision
    print(f"{perimeter:.12f}")

# Call the function to execute

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Process

The problem required finding the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that covers a set of points, with one side having a specific slope. The key challenge was correctly transforming the coordinate system to align the rectangle with the given slope.

### Insights from the Official Solution

1. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - The official solution uses a transformation based on trigonometric identities to align the rectangle with the slope M. Specifically, it calculates the cosine and sine of the angle derived from the slope M using the formula:
     \[
     \text{cos}(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + M^2}}, \quad \text{sin}(\theta) = \frac{M}{\sqrt{1 + M^2}}
     \]
   - This transformation is more direct and avoids the need for calculating the angle explicitly using `atan`.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - The solution efficiently computes the transformed coordinates and directly calculates the bounds (min and max) for these coordinates to determine the rectangle's dimensions.
   - This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, as it processes each point in constant time and uses minimal additional space.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter is calculated using the differences between the maximum and minimum transformed coordinates, which directly gives the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.

### Key Takeaways

- **Trigonometric Transformations**: Using trigonometric identities can simplify the transformation process, especially when dealing with slopes and angles.
- **Direct Calculation**: Avoid unnecessary calculations by directly using mathematical properties (like the Pythagorean identity) to derive needed values.
- **Precision**: Ensure that calculations maintain precision, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic, to meet problem constraints.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric transformations and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify complex problems.
