The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.\n$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. \nThat means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').\nIt is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.\n\n-----Input:-----Input:\n- \nFirst line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- \nThe first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. \n- \nThen $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.\n- \nThen $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.\n\n-----Output:-----Output:\nFor each testcase,print the scoreboard.\nThat means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order\n\n-----Constraints-----Constraints\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq R \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq ti \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq pi \\leq 10^6$\nSum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----Sample Input:\n1\n10 5\namigoes  1\nbannermen 1\nmonarchy 4\noutliers 5\niniciador 10\naegimos 2\niiiacdnor 1\neilorstu 1\ngimosae 3\nmnachroy 7\n\n-----Sample Output:-----Sample Output:\niniciador 11\nmonarchy 11\namigoes 6\noutliers 6\nbannermen 1\n\n-----Explanation:-----Explanation:\n\n$It$ $is$ $assured$ $that$ $each$ $team$ $will$ $submit$ $once$ $within$ $first$ $half$ $an$ $hour$.That means -                                          \n\nthat kind of submissions isn't possible within first half an hour.\nDataset can be huge.

The challenge was to correctly sort the problems based on this difficulty measure.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved:\n    1. Parsing the input to extract scores and contestant numbers for each problem.\n    2. Sorting the subtasks of each problem by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers.\n    3. Using a tuple `(decrease_count, index)` to represent the difficulty, which allowed for easy sorting of problems by difficulty and index.\n\n    A key insight was recognizing that sorting the subtasks by score simplifies the process of counting decreases in contestant numbers. This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially with the number of problems being as large as 100,000.\n\n    The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into these steps, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt. This problem reinforced the importance of sorting and tuple-based sorting for handling complex sorting criteria.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Our task is to calculate the total score for each team and then output the teams in descending order of their scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour.

As we read each submission, normalize the team name and add the score to the corresponding entry in the dictionary.\n\n4. **Sorting**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by their total score in descending order and then by their normalized team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied.\n\n5. **Output**: For each test case, output the sorted list of teams with their total scores.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_test_cases():\n    read T  # number of test cases\n    for each test case:\n        read N, R  # total submissions and submissions in the first half-hour\n        initialize a dictionary to store team scores\n        for each submission:\n            read team_name and score\n            normalize team_name by sorting its characters\n            add score to the dictionary entry for the normalized team_name\n        convert dictionary to a list of (team_name, score) tuples\n        sort the list by score descending, then by team_name lexicographically\n        output the sorted list\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_test_cases():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())\n        index += 1\n        \n        team_scores = {}\n        \n        for _ in range(N):\n            line = data[index].strip()\n            index += 1\n            team_name, score = line.rsplit(' ', 1)\n            score = int(score)\n            \n            # Normalize the team name by sorting its characters\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))\n            \n            # Aggregate the score for the normalized team name\n            if normalized_name in team_scores:\n                team_scores[normalized_name] += score\n            else:\n                team_scores[normalized_name] = score\n        \n        # Create a list of (team_name, score) tuples\n        sorted_teams = sorted(team_scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Collect results for this test case\n        results.append('\\n'.join(f\"{name} {score}\" for name, score in sorted_teams))\n    \n    # Print all results for all test cases\n    print('\\n\\n'.join(results))\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to compute and sort team scores, and outputs the results in the required format."

This will allow us to output the correct team name.\n\n2. **Use Original Names in Output**: When preparing the output, use the stored original team names instead of the normalized names.\n\nLet's update the code to fix these issues:\n\n```python\ndef process_test_cases():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())\n        index += 1\n        \n        team_scores = {}\n        original_names = {}\n        \n        for _ in range(N):\n            line = data[index].strip()\n            index += 1\n            team_name, score = line.rsplit(' ', 1)\n            score = int(score)\n            \n            # Normalize the team name by sorting its characters\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))\n            \n            # Aggregate the score for the normalized team name\n            if normalized_name in team_scores:\n                team_scores[normalized_name] += score\n            else:\n                team_scores[normalized_name] = score\n                original_names[normalized_name] = team_name  # Store the original name\n        \n        # Create a list of (original_team_name, score) tuples\n        sorted_teams = sorted(\n            ((original_names[name], score) for name, score in team_scores.items()),\n            key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0])\n        )\n        \n        # Collect results for this test case\n        results.append('\\n'.join(f\"{name} {score}\" for name, score in sorted_teams))\n    \n    # Print all results for all test cases\n    print('\\n\\n'.join(results))\n\n# Call the function to execute the logic\nprocess_test_cases()\n```\n\nThis updated code ensures that the original team names are used in the output, which should resolve the issue of incorrect output.

This step is crucial because it allows us to uniquely identify teams regardless of the order of characters in their names.\n\n2. **Score Aggregation**: The official solution uses a clever trick to handle score aggregation by initializing scores with a large number (`10**10`) and then subtracting scores. This approach ensures that scores are correctly accumulated and simplifies the sorting process by using negative scores for sorting in descending order.\n\n3. **Handling Submissions**: The official solution efficiently handles the submissions by maintaining a list of sorted team names (`sr`) and their corresponding scores (`a`). It then iterates over the remaining submissions, updating scores based on matching normalized names. This approach is both concise and effective.\n\n4. **Output**: The official solution directly sorts the list `a` based on the adjusted scores and outputs the results using the original team names stored in `a`. This ensures that the output is both correct and formatted as required.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity. It uses a single list to store both scores and team names, reducing the need for additional data structures.\n\nIn summary, the official solution is insightful in its use of a large initial score to simplify score aggregation and sorting. It effectively combines normalization, score aggregation, and output formatting into a concise and efficient solution. This approach highlights the importance of leveraging problem constraints (like unique team names) to simplify the solution."
