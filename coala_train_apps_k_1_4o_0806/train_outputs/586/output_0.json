    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to process multiple test cases where each test case involves a list of team submissions in a programming competition. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name can vary in the submissions. Our task is to calculate the total score for each team and then output the teams in descending order of their scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include a team name and a score.\n\n2. **Normalize Team Names**: Since the order of characters in a team name doesn't matter, normalize each team name by sorting its characters. This will allow us to uniquely identify each team regardless of the character order in the submissions.\n\n3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to aggregate scores for each normalized team name. As we read each submission, normalize the team name and add the score to the corresponding entry in the dictionary.\n\n4. **Sorting**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by their total score in descending order and then by their normalized team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied.\n\n5. **Output**: For each test case, output the sorted list of teams with their total scores.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_test_cases():\n    read T  # number of test cases\n    for each test case:\n        read N, R  # total submissions and submissions in the first half-hour\n        initialize a dictionary to store team scores\n        for each submission:\n            read team_name and score\n            normalize team_name by sorting its characters\n            add score to the dictionary entry for the normalized team_name\n        convert dictionary to a list of (team_name, score) tuples\n        sort the list by score descending, then by team_name lexicographically\n        output the sorted list\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_test_cases():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())\n        index += 1\n        \n        team_scores = {}\n        \n        for _ in range(N):\n            line = data[index].strip()\n            index += 1\n            team_name, score = line.rsplit(' ', 1)\n            score = int(score)\n            \n            # Normalize the team name by sorting its characters\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))\n            \n            # Aggregate the score for the normalized team name\n            if normalized_name in team_scores:\n                team_scores[normalized_name] += score\n            else:\n                team_scores[normalized_name] = score\n        \n        # Create a list of (team_name, score) tuples\n        sorted_teams = sorted(team_scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Collect results for this test case\n        results.append('\\n'.join(f\"{name} {score}\" for name, score in sorted_teams))\n    \n    # Print all results for all test cases\n    print('\\n\\n'.join(results))\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to compute and sort team scores, and outputs the results in the required format.",
