[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of the \( K \)-th powers of unique positive integers. We are given multiple test cases, each with its own \( N \) and \( K \).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find combinations of unique positive integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

2. **Approach**:
   - Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers.
   - For each integer starting from 1, calculate its \( K \)-th power and check if it can be part of the sum.
   - If adding this power to the current sum does not exceed \( N \), recursively attempt to find the rest of the sum using the next integers.
   - Ensure that each combination uses unique integers by always considering integers greater than the last used integer.
   - Count each valid combination that sums exactly to \( N \).

3. **Constraints Handling**:
   - The maximum value for \( N \) is 1000, and \( K \) can be up to 6, so the powers can be large, but the number of integers to consider is limited by the fact that their powers should not exceed \( N \).

### Pseudocode

```
function countWays(N, K):
    define recursive function findWays(current_sum, start):
        if current_sum == N:
            increment the count of valid ways
            return
        for each integer i starting from 'start':
            calculate power = i^K
            if current_sum + power > N:
                break the loop
            recursively call findWays(current_sum + power, i + 1)

    initialize count to 0
    call findWays(0, 1)
    return count

read T
for each test case:
    read N, K
    print countWays(N, K)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def countWays(N, K):
    def findWays(current_sum, start):
        nonlocal count
        if current_sum == N:
            count += 1
            return
        for i in range(start, N + 1):
            power = i ** K
            if current_sum + power > N:
                break
            findWays(current_sum + power, i + 1)

    count = 0
    findWays(0, 1)
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(countWays(N, K))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum to \( N \). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed sequentially.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries Q. For each query, we need to determine the number of subsets in which the Ith number appears at the Kth position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number I to be at the Kth position in a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers smaller than I in the subset. This means we need to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, I-1\}\).

        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from \(I-1\) numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{I-1}{K-1}\).

        3. **Remaining Elements**: After placing I at the Kth position, the remaining elements of the subset can be any subset of the numbers greater than I, i.e., from the set \(\{I+1, I+2, \ldots, N\}\). There are \(2^{N-I}\) such subsets.

        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we can precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible N.

        ## Pseudocode

        1. Precompute factorials and their inverses modulo \(10^9 + 7\) up to the maximum N.
        2. For each test case:
           - For each query (I, K):
             - If \(K > I\), output 0 (impossible to have I at Kth position).
             - Otherwise, compute the number of subsets using the formula:
               \[
               \text{result} = \binom{I-1}{K-1} \times 2^{N-I} \mod (10^9 + 7)
               \]
        3. Output the result for each query.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). We are given multiple test cases, each with different values of \( N \) and \( K \).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find all combinations of unique positive integers such that their \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

2. **Recursive Backtracking**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers. Starting from 1, we try to include each integer's \( K \)-th power in the sum and recursively check if we can reach the target sum \( N \).

3. **Base Cases**:
   - If the sum of powers equals \( N \), we have found a valid combination.
   - If the sum exceeds \( N \), we stop exploring that path.

4. **Recursive Case**: For each integer starting from 1, we decide whether to include its \( K \)-th power in the current sum and recursively attempt to complete the sum with the next integers.

5. **Avoid Duplicates**: Ensure that each combination of integers is unique by always considering integers in increasing order.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a recursive function `countWays(current_sum, start)`:
   - If `current_sum` equals \( N \), increment the count of valid combinations.
   - If `current_sum` exceeds \( N \), return.
   - For each integer `i` starting from `start`:
     - Calculate `i^K`.
     - Recursively call `countWays(current_sum + i^K, i + 1)`.

2. For each test case, initialize the count to 0 and call `countWays(0, 1)`.

3. Output the count for each test case.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def countWays(N, K, current_sum, start):
    if current_sum == N:
        return 1
    if current_sum > N:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    i = start
    while True:
        power = i ** K
        if current_sum + power > N:
            break
        count += countWays(N, K, current_sum + power, i + 1)
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])

        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed accordingly.

2. **Recursive Backtracking**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers. Starting from 1, we try to include each integer's \( K \)-th power in the sum and recursively check if we can reach the target sum \( N \).

3. **Base Cases**:
   - If the sum of powers equals \( N \), we have found a valid combination.
   - If the sum exceeds \( N \), we stop exploring that path.

4. **Recursive Case**: For each integer starting from 1, we decide whether to include its \( K \)-th power in the current sum and recursively attempt to complete the sum with the next integers.

5. **Avoid Duplicates**: Ensure that each combination of integers is unique by always considering integers in increasing order.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a recursive function `countWays(current_sum, start)`:
   - If `current_sum` equals \( N \), increment the count of valid combinations.
   - If `current_sum` exceeds \( N \), return.
   - For each integer `i` starting from `start`:
     - Calculate `i^K`.
     - Recursively call `countWays(current_sum + i^K, i + 1)`.

2. For each test case, initialize the count to 0 and call `countWays(0, 1)`.

3. Output the count for each test case.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def countWays(N, K, current_sum, start):
    if current_sum == N:
        return 1
    if current_sum > N:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    i = start
    while True:
        power = i ** K
        if current_sum + power > N:
            break
        count += countWays(N, K, current_sum + power, i + 1)
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        result = countWays(N, K, 0, 1)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed accordingly.

We need to determine the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). We are given multiple test cases, each with different values of \( N \) and \( K \).

1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find all combinations of unique positive integers such that their \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

2. **Recursive Backtracking**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers. Starting from 1, we try to include each integer's \( K \)-th power in the sum and recursively check if we can reach the target sum \( N \).

3. Output the count for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input**: The solution uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the input will not be processed, and no output will be generated.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is a common mistake when the function is intended to be the entry point for the program.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct. However, if the function is not called, this part will not execute.

4. **Recursive Function**: The recursive function `countWays` seems logically correct for counting the number of ways to sum up to \( N \) using unique integers raised to the power \( K \).

5. **Environment Feedback**: The feedback indicates that no output was detected, which suggests that the function `solve()` was not executed.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Function Execution**: Call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Verify Input/Output Handling**: Double-check that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

Let's correct the solution by ensuring the `solve()` function is called:

```python
def countWays(N, K, current_sum, start):
    if current_sum == N:
        return 1
    if current_sum > N:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    i = start
    while True:
        power = i ** K
        if current_sum + power > N:
            break
        count += countWays(N, K, current_sum + power, i + 1)
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        result = countWays(N, K, 0, 1)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Call the solve function to execute the program
solve()
```

By adding the call to `solve()`, the program will now read input, process each test case, and print the results as expected.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns

    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days, where each day features a different dish from a set of four options. The constraints are that consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last days must also differ. The challenge is to compute the number of such valid schedules efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    #### Strategies and Errors

    1. **Initial Approach**: The initial approach used a formula \( 4 \times 3^{(N-1)} \), which incorrectly assumed that the last day had 3 choices. This led to incorrect results for \( N > 2 \).

    2. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula is \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \). This accounts for:
       - 4 choices for the first day.
       - \( 3^{(N-2)} \) choices for the intermediate days.
       - 2 choices for the last day, ensuring it differs from both the previous day and the first day.

    3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using Python's `pow` function with three arguments allows efficient computation of large powers under a modulus, which is crucial for handling large \( N \).

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes

    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by adding a call to `main()` within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
    - **Formula Miscalculation**: The initial miscalculation of the formula was corrected by re-evaluating the constraints and adjusting the formula to \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \).

    ### Final Correct Code

    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return (4 * 3) % MOD
        else:
            # Using modular exponentiation to compute 3^(N-2) % MOD
            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)
            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    # Call the main function to execute the program
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering problem constraints and verifying the logic of mathematical formulas used in algorithmic solutions.

The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). We are given multiple test cases, each with different values of \( N \) and \( K \).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find all combinations of unique positive integers such that their \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

2. **Recursive Backtracking**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers. Starting from 1, we try to include each integer's \( K \)-th power in the sum and recursively check if we can reach the target sum \( N \).

3. **Base Cases**:
   - If the sum of powers equals \( N \), we have found a valid combination.
   - If the sum exceeds \( N \), we stop exploring that path.

4. **Recursive Case**: For each integer starting from 1, we decide whether to include its \( K \)-th power in the current sum and recursively attempt to complete the sum with the next integers.

5. **Avoid Duplicates**: Ensure that each combination of integers is unique by always considering integers in increasing order.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a recursive function `countWays(current_sum, start)`:
   - If `current_sum` equals \( N \), increment the count of valid combinations.
   - If `current_sum` exceeds \( N \), return.
   - For each integer `i` starting from `start`:
     - Calculate `i^K`.
     - Recursively call `countWays(current_sum + i^K, i + 1)`.

2. For each test case, initialize the count to 0 and call `countWays(0, 1)`.

3. Output the count for each test case.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def countWays(N, K, current_sum, start):
    if current_sum == N:
        return 1
    if current_sum > N:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    i = start
    while True:
        power = i ** K
        if current_sum + power > N:
            break
        count += countWays(N, K, current_sum + power, i + 1)
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        result = countWays(N, K, 0, 1)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed accordingly.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input**: The solution uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the input will not be processed, and no output will be generated.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is a common mistake when the function is intended to be the entry point for the program.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct. However, if the function is not called, this part will not execute.

4. **Recursive Function**: The recursive function `countWays` seems logically correct for counting the number of ways to sum up to \( N \) using unique integers raised to the power \( K \).

5. **Environment Feedback**: The feedback indicates that no output was detected, which suggests that the function `solve()` was not executed.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Function Execution**: Call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Verify Input/Output Handling**: Double-check that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

Let's correct the solution by ensuring the `solve()` function is called:

```python
def countWays(N, K, current_sum, start):
    if current_sum == N:
        return 1
    if current_sum > N:

        power = i ** K
        if current_sum + power > N:
            break
        count += countWays(N, K, current_sum + power, i + 1)
        i += 1
    return count

    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []

        result = countWays(N, K, 0, 1)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Call the solve function to execute the program

```

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). The solution involved using a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers.

### Key Concepts and Patterns:
- **Recursive Backtracking**: This approach is useful for exploring all possible combinations of elements that satisfy a given condition. In this case, it was used to find combinations of integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).
- **Unique Combinations**: Ensuring that each combination of integers is unique by always considering integers in increasing order.

### Strategies:
- **Recursive Function**: A recursive function `countWays` was used to explore combinations. It checked if the current sum matched \( N \) and recursively added powers of integers to the sum.
- **Base and Recursive Cases**: The function handled base cases where the sum matched or exceeded \( N \), and recursively explored further combinations otherwise.

### Fixes and Learnings:
- **Function Execution**: Initially, the function `solve()` was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called is crucial for the program to execute and produce results.
- **Input/Output Handling**: Properly reading input and printing output is essential, especially in competitive programming environments where the program reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

This experience reinforced the importance of recursive backtracking for combination problems and highlighted the need for careful handling of function calls and I/O operations in coding challenges.

5. **Avoid Duplicates**: Ensure that each combination of integers is unique by always considering integers in increasing order.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a recursive function `countWays(current_sum, start)`:
   - If `current_sum` equals \( N \), increment the count of valid combinations.
   - If `current_sum` exceeds \( N \), return.
   - For each integer `i` starting from `start`:
     - Calculate `i^K`.
     - Recursively call `countWays(current_sum + i^K, i + 1)`.

2. For each test case, initialize the count to 0 and call `countWays(0, 1)`.

3. Output the count for each test case.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def countWays(N, K, current_sum, start):
    if current_sum == N:
        return 1
    if current_sum > N:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    i = start
    while True:
        power = i ** K
        if current_sum + power > N:
            break
        count += countWays(N, K, current_sum + power, i + 1)
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        result = countWays(N, K, 0, 1)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed accordingly.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input**: The solution uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the input will not be processed, and no output will be generated.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is a common mistake when the function is intended to be the entry point for the program.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct. However, if the function is not called, this part will not execute.

4. **Recursive Function**: The recursive function `countWays` seems logically correct for counting the number of ways to sum up to \( N \) using unique integers raised to the power \( K \).

5. **Environment Feedback**: The feedback indicates that no output was detected, which suggests that the function `solve()` was not executed.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Ensure Function Execution**: Call the `solve()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Verify Input/Output Handling**: Double-check that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

Let's correct the solution by ensuring the `solve()` function is called:

```python
def countWays(N, K, current_sum, start):
    if current_sum == N:
        return 1
    if current_sum > N:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    i = start
    while True:
        power = i ** K
        if current_sum + power > N:
            break
        count += countWays(N, K, current_sum + power, i + 1)
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        result = countWays(N, K, 0, 1)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Call the solve function to execute the program
solve()
```

By adding the call to `solve()`, the program will now read input, process each test case, and print the results as expected.

# Call the solve function to execute the program

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x,n = map(int,input().split())
    reach = [0]*(x+1)
    reach[0] = 1
    i=1
    while i**n<=x:
        j = 1
        while j+i**n<=x:
            j+=1
        j-=1
        while j>=0:
            if reach[j]>0:
                reach[j+i**n]+=reach[j]
            j-=1
        i+=1
    #print(reach)
    print(reach[-1])

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach, which is both efficient and elegant. It maintains an array `reach` where `reach[j]` represents the number of ways to sum up to `j` using unique integers raised to the power \( n \). This approach efficiently builds up solutions for smaller subproblems to solve the larger problem.

2. **Iterative vs Recursive**: My initial solution used a recursive backtracking approach, which is straightforward but can be less efficient due to repeated calculations and deeper recursion, especially for larger values of \( N \). The dynamic programming approach avoids this by iteratively building up the solution, which is generally more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.

3. **State Transition**: The official solution cleverly uses nested loops to update the `reach` array. For each integer \( i \), it calculates \( i^n \) and updates the `reach` array for all possible sums that can include \( i^n \). This ensures that each combination of integers is unique and efficiently counts the number of ways to reach the target sum.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: The official solution handles boundary conditions well by ensuring that the loop only considers powers of integers that do not exceed \( x \), and it updates the `reach` array in a way that prevents overcounting.

In summary, the official solution is insightful in demonstrating how dynamic programming can be applied to combinatorial problems involving sums and powers. It highlights the importance of building solutions iteratively and efficiently managing state transitions to avoid redundant calculations. This approach is a valuable technique for solving similar problems in the future.

    - Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

    -----Constraints-----
