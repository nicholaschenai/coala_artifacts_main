        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a list of strings, and we need to find the shortest string that contains each of the given strings as a substring. Importantly, no string in the list is a substring of another string in the list. The order of the strings in the final result does not matter as long as all strings are included as substrings.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Overlap**: For each pair of strings, determine the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of another. This overlap will help in minimizing the length of the final superstring.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each string is a node. The edge weight between two nodes (strings) is the overlap length. The goal is to find a path that visits all nodes (strings) and minimizes the total length of the superstring.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking**: Use dynamic programming to explore all possible combinations of strings. Use a bitmask to represent the set of strings included in the current superstring. For each state, keep track of the last string added to the superstring and the current length of the superstring.\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Solution**: Once the optimal path is found using dynamic programming, reconstruct the superstring by backtracking through the states.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. **Calculate Overlaps**:\n   - For each pair of strings `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of `A[i]` matches the prefix of `A[j]`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:\n   - Let `dp[mask][i]` be the minimum length of a superstring that contains the set of strings represented by `mask` and ends with the string `A[i]`.\n   - Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` to the length of `A[i]` for each string `i`.\n\n3. **DP Transition**:\n   - For each `mask` and each string `i` in `mask`, try to extend the superstring by adding another string `j` not in `mask`.\n   - Update `dp[mask | (1 << j)][j]` using the overlap between `A[i]` and `A[j]`.\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Superstring**:\n   - Start from the state with all strings included and backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - Return the reconstructed superstring.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:\n        n = len(A)\n        \n        # Calculate the overlap between each pair of strings\n        def calculate_overlap(s1, s2):\n            max_overlap = 0\n            for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n                if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n                    max_overlap = i\n            return max_overlap\n        \n        # Precompute the overlap between each pair of strings\n        overlap = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i != j:\n                    overlap[i][j] = calculate_overlap(A[i], A[j])\n        \n        # dp[mask][i] will store the minimum length of superstring ending with A[i]\n        dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n        parent = [[-1] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n        \n        # Initialize the dp array\n        for i in range(n):\n            dp[1 << i][i] = len(A[i])\n        \n        # Fill the dp table\n        for mask in range(1 << n):\n            for i in range(n):\n                if mask & (1 << i) == 0:\n                    continue\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if mask & (1 << j) != 0:\n                        continue\n                    new_mask = mask | (1 << j)\n                    new_length = dp[mask][i] + len(A[j]) - overlap[i][j]\n                    if new_length < dp[new_mask][j]:\n                        dp[new_mask][j] = new_length\n                        parent[new_mask][j] = i\n        \n        # Find the minimum length superstring\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        last = -1\n        final_mask = (1 << n) - 1\n        for i in range(n):\n            if dp[final_mask][i] < min_length:\n                min_length = dp[final_mask][i]\n                last = i\n        \n        # Reconstruct the shortest superstring\n        mask = final_mask\n        order = []\n        while last != -1:\n            order.append(last)\n            next_last = parent[mask][last]\n            mask ^= (1 << last)\n            last = next_last\n        \n        order.reverse()\n        \n        # Build the final superstring\n        superstring = A[order[0]]\n        for k in range(1, len(order)):\n            i, j = order[k-1], order[k]\n            superstring += A[j][overlap[i][j]:]\n        \n        return superstring\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming with bitmasking to efficiently find the shortest superstring that contains all the given strings as substrings."

i < S.size(); i++)\n            sa_extend(S[i]);\n \n        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {\n            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st[v].link ;\n                l = st[v].len;\n            }\n            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st [v].next[T[i]];\n                l++;\n            }\n            if (l > best) {\n                best = l;\n                bestpos = i;\n            }\n        }\n        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);\n    } \n    ```\n\n    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings\n\n    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.\n    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.\n\n    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):\n\n    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \\dots + S_k + D_k.$$\n\n    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.\n\n    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.\n    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \\dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \\dots, D_k$.\n\n    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.\n    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.\n    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The core concept was to iteratively merge strings by calculating the maximum overlap between pairs of strings and using this information to build the shortest possible superstring.\n\nThe solution involved setting up a dynamic programming (DP) table to store the length of the shortest superstring for each subset of strings, and a path table to track the order of strings for reconstructing the superstring. The overlap function was crucial in determining how much of one string could be appended to another without redundancy.\n\nOne key insight was the use of bitmasking to efficiently represent subsets of strings, which allowed for a compact and efficient DP solution. The challenge was ensuring that the DP table was correctly updated with the maximum overlap values, which required careful iteration over all possible subsets and string pairs.\n\nThe solution was successful, passing all test cases, and demonstrated the power of combining dynamic programming with greedy strategies for optimization problems involving string manipulation. This approach is particularly useful in problems where the goal is to minimize or maximize a certain property (like length) while satisfying a set of constraints (like containing all substrings)."

The challenge is to efficiently merge strings by maximizing overlaps.\n   - My initial approach used dynamic programming to track overlaps and reconstruct the superstring, which is a valid strategy but can be complex to implement correctly.\n\n2. **Official Solution Insights:**\n   - The official solution uses a memoization technique to optimize the recursive calculation of the shortest superstring. This is a powerful approach to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.\n   - The `merge` function is used to concatenate two strings with the maximum possible overlap, which is a crucial step in minimizing the length of the superstring.\n   - The `find_short` function recursively finds the shortest superstring for a given subset of strings, using memoization to store and reuse results.\n\n3. **Key Differences and Improvements:**\n   - The official solution simplifies the problem by using a recursive approach with memoization, which can be more intuitive and easier to manage than a full dynamic programming table.\n   - The use of a decorator for memoization (`@memo`) is a neat way to cache results of recursive calls, reducing the need for manual management of a DP table.\n   - The solution also includes a preprocessing step to remove any string that is a substring of another, which simplifies the problem space.\n\n4. **Learning Points:**\n   - Memoization can be a powerful tool in recursive solutions, especially when dealing with overlapping subproblems.\n   - Simplifying the problem space by removing unnecessary elements (e.g., substrings) can lead to more efficient solutions.\n   - The official solution's use of Python's functional programming features (like decorators) can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.\n\nOverall, the official solution provides a more elegant and efficient approach to solving the problem, leveraging memoization and recursive strategies effectively. This experience highlights the importance of considering different algorithmic techniques and the potential benefits of simplifying the problem space before diving into complex implementations."

It uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum overlap between pairs of strings and stores these overlaps in a DP table. The function iterates over all subsets of the input strings, updating the DP table to find the maximum overlap for each subset. It then reconstructs the shortest superstring by tracing back through a path table that records the sequence of strings leading to the optimal solution. The final superstring is built by concatenating the strings in the order determined by the path, using the calculated overlaps to minimize the total length. The result is the shortest possible superstring that includes all input strings.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to find the shortest possible string that contains a set of given strings as substrings. This is a common problem in bioinformatics, particularly in DNA sequencing, where you need to assemble short DNA reads into a longer sequence. It is also applicable in data compression, where you want to minimize the length of a string that contains all given patterns. The solution involves dynamic programming and bit manipulation, which are useful techniques in solving optimization problems involving subsets and overlaps."
