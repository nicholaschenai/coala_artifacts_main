    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a list of strings, and we need to find the shortest string that contains each of the given strings as a substring. None of the strings in the list is a substring of another. The solution should be able to handle up to 12 strings, each with a length of up to 20 characters.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively merge strings by overlapping them as much as possible. We can calculate the overlap between two strings and use this information to build the shortest superstring. We will use a dynamic programming table to store the shortest superstring that can be formed using a subset of the strings, and we will update this table as we consider each string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function to calculate the overlap between two strings.\n   Initialize a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset of strings.\n   Initialize a table to store the path to reconstruct the superstring.\n   For each subset of strings:\n       For each string in the subset:\n           Calculate the shortest superstring by considering the overlap with other strings.\n           Update the DP table with the shortest superstring length.\n           Update the path table to keep track of the order of strings.\n   Reconstruct the shortest superstring using the path table.\n   Return the shortest superstring.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:\n        # Helper function to calculate the overlap between two strings\n        def overlap(s1, s2):\n            max_overlap = 0\n            # Check all possible overlaps\n            for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n                if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n                    max_overlap = i\n            return max_overlap\n\n        n = len(A)\n        # DP table to store the shortest superstring length for each subset\n        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n        # Path table to reconstruct the superstring\n        path = [[-1] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n\n        # Fill the DP table\n        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):\n            for i in range(n):\n                if not (mask & (1 << i)):\n                    continue\n                prev_mask = mask ^ (1 << i)\n                if prev_mask == 0:\n                    continue\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if not (prev_mask & (1 << j)):\n                        continue\n                    # Calculate overlap between A[j] and A[i]\n                    o = overlap(A[j], A[i])\n                    # Update DP table if a shorter superstring is found\n                    if dp[mask][i] < dp[prev_mask][j] + o:\n                        dp[mask][i] = dp[prev_mask][j] + o\n                        path[mask][i] = j\n\n        # Find the end of the shortest superstring\n        max_len = -1\n        last = -1\n        full_mask = (1 << n) - 1\n        for i in range(n):\n            if dp[full_mask][i] > max_len:\n                max_len = dp[full_mask][i]\n                last = i\n\n        # Reconstruct the shortest superstring\n        superstring = []\n        mask = full_mask\n        while last != -1:\n            superstring.append(last)\n            next_last = path[mask][last]\n            mask ^= (1 << last)\n            last = next_last\n\n        # Build the final superstring\n        superstring.reverse()\n        result = A[superstring[0]]\n        for k in range(1, len(superstring)):\n            i, j = superstring[k-1], superstring[k]\n            o = overlap(A[i], A[j])\n            result += A[j][o:]\n\n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the shortest superstring by considering all possible overlaps between the strings.
