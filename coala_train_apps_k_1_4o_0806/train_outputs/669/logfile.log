## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.

- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7$10^9+7$.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a country with several cities connected by roads. Ryan starts in city 1 and can move to adjacent cities or stay in the same city over a series of seconds. We need to determine how many different sequences of city visits Ryan can make over a given number of seconds, while satisfying certain conditions that specify which city he must be in at specific seconds. The result should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. This involves:
   - Initializing a DP table where `dp[t][c]` represents the number of ways to be in city `c` at time `t`.
   - Start with `dp[0][1] = 1` since Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

3. **Transition**: For each second, update the DP table based on the current city and its adjacent cities:
   - For each city `c` at time `t`, distribute the number of ways to all its adjacent cities at time `t+1`.

4. **Apply Conditions**: For each condition `(a_i, b_i)`, ensure that the number of ways to be in city `a_i` at time `b_i` is non-zero. If any condition cannot be satisfied, the result is 0 for that test case.

5. **Result Calculation**: After processing all seconds, the result is the sum of all possible ways to be in any city at the final second `K`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

```
function countTrips(T, test_cases):
    MOD = 10^9 + 7
    results = []
    
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, M, K = test_case['N'], test_case['M'], test_case['K']
        roads = test_case['roads']
        Q = test_case['Q']
        conditions = test_case['conditions']
        
        # Initialize adjacency list for the graph
        graph = [[] for _ in range(N+1)]
        for u, v in roads:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        # Initialize DP table
        dp = [[0] * (N+1) for _ in range(K+1)]
        dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0
        
        # Fill DP table
        for t in range(K):
            for c in range(1, N+1):
                if dp[t][c] > 0:
                    # Move to adjacent cities or stay
                    for neighbor in graph[c]:
                        dp[t+1][neighbor] = (dp[t+1][neighbor] + dp[t][c]) % MOD
                    dp[t+1][c] = (dp[t+1][c] + dp[t][c]) % MOD
        
        # Check conditions
        valid = True
        for a, b in conditions:
            if dp[b][a] == 0:
                valid = False
                break
        
        # Calculate result
        if valid:
            result = sum(dp[K]) % MOD
        else:
            result = 0
        
        results.append(result)
    
    return results
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def countTrips(T, test_cases):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    results = []
    
    for test_case in test_cases:

        dp = [[0] * (N+1) for _ in range(K+1)]
        dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0
        
        # Fill DP table
        for t in range(K):

                if dp[t][c] > 0:
                    # Move to adjacent cities or stay
                    for neighbor in graph[c]:
                        dp[t+1][neighbor] = (dp[t+1][neighbor] + dp[t][c]) % MOD
                    dp[t+1][c] = (dp[t+1][c] + dp[t][c]) % MOD
        
        # Check conditions
        valid = True
        for a, b in conditions:
            if dp[b][a] == 0:
                valid = False
                break
        
        # Calculate result
        if valid:
            result = sum(dp[K]) % MOD
        else:
            result = 0
        
        results.append(result)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# T = number of test cases
# test_cases = list of test case dictionaries with keys 'N', 'M', 'K', 'roads', 'Q', 'conditions'
# print(countTrips(T, test_cases))
```

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries Q. For each query, we need to determine the number of subsets in which the Ith number appears at the Kth position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number I to be at the Kth position in a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers smaller than I in the subset. This means we need to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, I-1\}\).

        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from \(I-1\) numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{I-1}{K-1}\).

        3. **Remaining Elements**: After placing I at the Kth position, the remaining elements of the subset can be any subset of the numbers greater than I, i.e., from the set \(\{I+1, I+2, \ldots, N\}\). There are \(2^{N-I}\) such subsets.

        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we can precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible N.

        ## Pseudocode

        1. Precompute factorials and their inverses modulo \(10^9 + 7\) up to the maximum N.
        2. For each test case:
           - For each query (I, K):
             - If \(K > I\), output 0 (impossible to have I at Kth position).
             - Otherwise, compute the number of subsets using the formula:
               \[
               \text{result} = \binom{I-1}{K-1} \times 2^{N-I} \mod (10^9 + 7)
               \]
        3. Output the result for each query.

        ## Final Python Solution

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

Ryan is in a country with N cities connected by M bidirectional roads. He starts in city 1 and has K seconds to move between cities. He can either move to an adjacent city or stay in the current city each second. Ryan has Q conditions specifying that he must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. We need to determine how many different trips Ryan can make that satisfy all conditions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp[t][c]` where `t` is the time in seconds and `c` is the city. `dp[t][c]` will store the number of ways to reach city `c` at time `t`.

3. **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0][1] = 1` because Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0. All other `dp[0][c]` should be 0 for `c != 1`.

4. **DP Transition**: For each second `t` from 1 to K, update `dp[t][c]` for each city `c` by considering:
   - Staying in the same city: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][c]`
   - Moving from an adjacent city `u` to `c`: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][u]` for each `u` connected to `c`.

5. **Condition Checking**: After filling the DP table, check if the conditions `(a_i, b_i)` are satisfied. If any condition is not satisfied, the number of valid trips is 0.

6. **Result Calculation**: If all conditions are satisfied, the result is the sum of all valid paths that satisfy the conditions.

7. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of cities, roads, and seconds.
   - Build the graph using adjacency lists.
   - Initialize the DP table.
   - Fill the DP table using the transition rules.
   - Check the conditions.
   - Calculate the result and apply modulo.
3. Output the results for each test case.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N$N$, M$M$ and K$K$.
- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7$10^9+7$.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤Tâ‰¤50$1 \le T \le 50$
- 1â‰¤N,M,K,Qâ‰¤9,000$1 \le N, M, K, Q \le 9,000$
- 1â‰¤ui,viâ‰¤N$1 \le u_i, v_i \le N$ for each valid i$i$
- uiâ‰ vi$u_i \neq v_i$ for each valid i$i$
- there is at most one road between each pair of cities
- each city is reachable from every other city
- 1â‰¤aiâ‰¤N$1 \le a_i \le N$ for each valid i$i$
- 0â‰¤biâ‰¤K$0 \le b_i \le K$ for each valid i$i$
- the sum of N$N$ over all test cases does not exceed 9,000$9,000$

Ryan is in a country with N cities connected by M bidirectional roads. He starts in city 1 and has K seconds to move between cities. He can either move to an adjacent city or stay in the current city each second. Ryan has Q conditions specifying that he must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. We need to determine how many different trips Ryan can make that satisfy all conditions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp[t][c]` where `t` is the time in seconds and `c` is the city. `dp[t][c]` will store the number of ways to reach city `c` at time `t`.

3. **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0][1] = 1` because Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0. All other `dp[0][c]` should be 0 for `c != 1`.

4. **DP Transition**: For each second `t` from 1 to K, update `dp[t][c]` for each city `c` by considering:
   - Staying in the same city: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][c]`
   - Moving from an adjacent city `u` to `c`: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][u]` for each `u` connected to `c`.

5. **Condition Checking**: After filling the DP table, check if the conditions `(a_i, b_i)` are satisfied. If any condition is not satisfied, the number of valid trips is 0.

6. **Result Calculation**: If all conditions are satisfied, the result is the sum of all valid paths that satisfy the conditions.

7. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of cities, roads, and seconds.
   - Build the graph using adjacency lists.
   - Initialize the DP table.
   - Fill the DP table using the transition rules.
   - Check the conditions.
   - Calculate the result and apply modulo.
3. Output the results for each test case.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there is no output detected. This usually indicates an issue with how the input is read or how the output is printed. The function `solve()` is defined but not called, which means the code that processes the input and produces the output is never executed.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function should be called to execute the logic. This is a common oversight when defining functions for competitive programming problems.

3. **Logic Verification**: The logic for filling the DP table and checking conditions seems correct based on the problem description. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify if the logic is indeed correct.

4. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the logic correctly handles edge cases, such as when there are no conditions (`Q = 0`), which seems to be handled by the current logic.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly in the DP table updates and the final result calculation.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called. Let's update the code to include this call and verify the logic:

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Verification**: The logic inside the function remains unchanged, as it appears to be correct based on the problem description. The primary issue was the lack of execution due to the missing function call.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.

- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Ryan is in a country with N cities connected by M bidirectional roads. He starts in city 1 and has K seconds to move between cities. He can either move to an adjacent city or stay in the current city each second. Ryan has Q conditions specifying that he must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. We need to determine how many different trips Ryan can make that satisfy all conditions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp[t][c]` where `t` is the time in seconds and `c` is the city. `dp[t][c]` will store the number of ways to reach city `c` at time `t`.

3. **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0][1] = 1` because Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0. All other `dp[0][c]` should be 0 for `c != 1`.

4. **DP Transition**: For each second `t` from 1 to K, update `dp[t][c]` for each city `c` by considering:
   - Staying in the same city: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][c]`
   - Moving from an adjacent city `u` to `c`: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][u]` for each `u` connected to `c`.

5. **Condition Checking**: After filling the DP table, check if the conditions `(a_i, b_i)` are satisfied. If any condition is not satisfied, the number of valid trips is 0.

6. **Result Calculation**: If all conditions are satisfied, the result is the sum of all valid paths that satisfy the conditions.

7. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of cities, roads, and seconds.
   - Build the graph using adjacency lists.
   - Initialize the DP table.
   - Fill the DP table using the transition rules.
   - Check the conditions.
   - Calculate the result and apply modulo.
3. Output the results for each test case.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Verification**: The logic inside the function remains unchanged, as it appears to be correct based on the problem description. The primary issue was the lack of execution due to the missing function call.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

        1. **Reading Input**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach, but we need to ensure that the input is being processed correctly.

        2. **Output**: The code appends results to a list and then writes them all at once using `sys.stdout.write()`. This should work, but we need to ensure that the results are being computed and stored correctly.

        3. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is likely the reason why no output is being produced. The function needs to be called to execute the logic.

        4. **Logic and Computation**: The logic for computing the number of subsets seems correct based on the problem statement. However, we need to ensure that the precomputation of factorials and inverses is correct and that the binomial coefficient and power of two calculations are accurate.

        5. **Edge Cases**: We should ensure that edge cases, such as when \(K > I\), are handled correctly by returning 0.

        Let's fix the issue by ensuring the `solve()` function is called and verify the logic step-by-step.

        Here's the corrected code:

        ```python
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
            factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverse_factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    
            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD
    
            inverse_factorial[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD - 2, MOD)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverse_factorial[i] = inverse_factorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD
    
            return factorial, inverse_factorial

        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorial, inverse_factorial):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % MOD * inverse_factorial[n - k] % MOD

        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
    
            max_n = 4000
            factorial, inverse_factorial = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n)
    
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                Q = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                for _ in range(Q):
                    I = int(data[index])
                    K = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        binom = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorial, inverse_factorial)
                        power_of_two = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = binom * power_of_two % MOD
                        results.append(result)
    
            sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

        # Call the solve function to execute the solution
        solve()
        ```

        ### Key Fixes:
        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
        - **Verification**: Double-checked the logic for computing binomial coefficients and powers of two to ensure correctness.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N$N$, M$M$ and K$K$.
- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7$10^9+7$.

-----Constraints-----

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Ryan is in a country with N cities connected by M bidirectional roads. He starts in city 1 and has K seconds to move between cities. He can either move to an adjacent city or stay in the current city each second. Ryan has Q conditions specifying that he must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. We need to determine how many different trips Ryan can make that satisfy all conditions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp[t][c]` where `t` is the time in seconds and `c` is the city. `dp[t][c]` will store the number of ways to reach city `c` at time `t`.

3. **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0][1] = 1` because Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0. All other `dp[0][c]` should be 0 for `c != 1`.

4. **DP Transition**: For each second `t` from 1 to K, update `dp[t][c]` for each city `c` by considering:
   - Staying in the same city: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][c]`
   - Moving from an adjacent city `u` to `c`: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][u]` for each `u` connected to `c`.

5. **Condition Checking**: After filling the DP table, check if the conditions `(a_i, b_i)` are satisfied. If any condition is not satisfied, the number of valid trips is 0.

6. **Result Calculation**: If all conditions are satisfied, the result is the sum of all valid paths that satisfy the conditions.

7. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of cities, roads, and seconds.
   - Build the graph using adjacency lists.
   - Initialize the DP table.
   - Fill the DP table using the transition rules.
   - Check the conditions.
   - Calculate the result and apply modulo.
3. Output the results for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there is no output detected. This usually indicates an issue with how the input is read or how the output is printed. The function `solve()` is defined but not called, which means the code that processes the input and produces the output is never executed.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function should be called to execute the logic. This is a common oversight when defining functions for competitive programming problems.

3. **Logic Verification**: The logic for filling the DP table and checking conditions seems correct based on the problem description. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify if the logic is indeed correct.

4. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the logic correctly handles edge cases, such as when there are no conditions (`Q = 0`), which seems to be handled by the current logic.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly in the DP table updates and the final result calculation.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called. Let's update the code to include this call and verify the logic:

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        K = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        # Build the graph
        graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
        for _ in range(M):
            u = int(data[index])
            v = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        # Read conditions
        Q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        conditions = []
        for _ in range(Q):
            a = int(data[index])
            b = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            conditions.append((a, b))
        
        # Initialize DP table
        dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
        dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0
        
        # Fill DP table
        for t in range(1, K + 1):
            for c in range(1, N + 1):
                # Stay in the same city
                dp[t][c] = dp[t - 1][c]
                # Move from adjacent cities
                for u in graph[c]:
                    dp[t][c] = (dp[t][c] + dp[t - 1][u]) % MOD
        
        # Check conditions
        valid = True
        for a, b in conditions:
            if dp[b][a] == 0:
                valid = False
                break
        
        if valid:
            # Calculate the number of valid trips
            result = sum(dp[K][c] for c in range(1, N + 1)) % MOD

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Understanding the Output**: The feedback indicates that the output is `['28', '28', '28']` for all test cases, which suggests that the logic for handling conditions is not correctly implemented or applied.

2. **Condition Handling**: The conditions `(a_i, b_i)` specify that Ryan must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. The current implementation checks if `dp[b][a]` is non-zero for each condition, but it does not ensure that these conditions are the only constraints applied to the DP table.

3. **DP Table Calculation**: The DP table is being filled correctly, but the conditions are not being enforced during the DP table updates. Instead, they are only checked after the table is filled, which is incorrect.

4. **Logic Error**: The logic should enforce the conditions while filling the DP table, ensuring that only paths that satisfy all conditions are considered.

### Steps to Fix the Solution:

1. **Enforce Conditions During DP Calculation**: Modify the DP table updates to only allow transitions that satisfy the conditions. This means that if a condition specifies that Ryan must be in city `a_i` at time `b_i`, then `dp[b_i][a_i]` should be the only valid state at that time.

2. **Recalculate Valid Paths**: After enforcing the conditions, recalculate the number of valid paths that satisfy all conditions.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly handles cases where no valid paths exist due to conflicting conditions.

Let's update the code to incorporate these changes:

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        K = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3

            u = int(data[index])
            v = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)

        Q = int(data[index])

            if b in conditions:
                if conditions[b] != a:
                    # Conflicting conditions, no valid path
                    results.append(0)
                    break
            else:
                conditions[b] = a
        else:
            # Initialize DP table
            dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
            dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0
            
            # Fill DP table
            for t in range(1, K + 1):
                for c in range(1, N + 1):
                    if t in conditions and conditions[t] != c:
                        # If there's a condition for this time, skip cities that don't match
                        continue
                    # Stay in the same city
                    dp[t][c] = dp[t - 1][c]
                    # Move from adjacent cities
                    for u in graph[c]:
                        dp[t][c] = (dp[t][c] + dp[t - 1][u]) % MOD
            
            # Calculate the number of valid trips
            result = sum(dp[K][c] for c in range(1, N + 1)) % MOD
            results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Call the solve function to execute the solution
solve()
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Condition Enforcement**: During the DP table updates, we now check if a condition exists for the current time `t`. If a condition exists, we only update the DP table for the city specified by the condition.
- **Conflict Handling**: If conflicting conditions are detected (i.e., two different cities required at the same time), we immediately append `0` to the results and break out of the loop for that test case.
- **Logic Correction**: The logic now correctly enforces conditions during the DP table updates, ensuring only valid paths are considered.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.

- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Ryan is in a country with N cities connected by M bidirectional roads. He starts in city 1 and has K seconds to move between cities. He can either move to an adjacent city or stay in the current city each second. Ryan has Q conditions specifying that he must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. We need to determine how many different trips Ryan can make that satisfy all conditions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp[t][c]` where `t` is the time in seconds and `c` is the city. `dp[t][c]` will store the number of ways to reach city `c` at time `t`.

3. **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0][1] = 1` because Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0. All other `dp[0][c]` should be 0 for `c != 1`.

4. **DP Transition**: For each second `t` from 1 to K, update `dp[t][c]` for each city `c` by considering:
   - Staying in the same city: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][c]`
   - Moving from an adjacent city `u` to `c`: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][u]` for each `u` connected to `c`.

5. **Condition Checking**: After filling the DP table, check if the conditions `(a_i, b_i)` are satisfied. If any condition is not satisfied, the number of valid trips is 0.

6. **Result Calculation**: If all conditions are satisfied, the result is the sum of all valid paths that satisfy the conditions.

7. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of cities, roads, and seconds.
   - Build the graph using adjacency lists.
   - Initialize the DP table.
   - Fill the DP table using the transition rules.
   - Check the conditions.
   - Calculate the result and apply modulo.
3. Output the results for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there is no output detected. This usually indicates an issue with how the input is read or how the output is printed. The function `solve()` is defined but not called, which means the code that processes the input and produces the output is never executed.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function should be called to execute the logic. This is a common oversight when defining functions for competitive programming problems.

3. **Logic Verification**: The logic for filling the DP table and checking conditions seems correct based on the problem description. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify if the logic is indeed correct.

4. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the logic correctly handles edge cases, such as when there are no conditions (`Q = 0`), which seems to be handled by the current logic.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly in the DP table updates and the final result calculation.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called. Let's update the code to include this call and verify the logic:

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Verification**: The logic inside the function remains unchanged, as it appears to be correct based on the problem description. The primary issue was the lack of execution due to the missing function call.

### Key Fixes:
- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Verification**: The logic inside the function remains unchanged, as it appears to be correct based on the problem description. The primary issue was the lack of execution due to the missing function call.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Understanding the Output**: The feedback indicates that the output is `['28', '28', '28']` for all test cases, which suggests that the logic for handling conditions is not correctly implemented or applied.

2. **Condition Handling**: The conditions `(a_i, b_i)` specify that Ryan must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. The current implementation checks if `dp[b][a]` is non-zero for each condition, but it does not ensure that these conditions are the only constraints applied to the DP table.

3. **DP Table Calculation**: The DP table is being filled correctly, but the conditions are not being enforced during the DP table updates. Instead, they are only checked after the table is filled, which is incorrect.

4. **Logic Error**: The logic should enforce the conditions while filling the DP table, ensuring that only paths that satisfy all conditions are considered.

### Steps to Fix the Solution:

1. **Enforce Conditions During DP Calculation**: Modify the DP table updates to only allow transitions that satisfy the conditions. This means that if a condition specifies that Ryan must be in city `a_i` at time `b_i`, then `dp[b_i][a_i]` should be the only valid state at that time.

2. **Recalculate Valid Paths**: After enforcing the conditions, recalculate the number of valid paths that satisfy all conditions.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly handles cases where no valid paths exist due to conflicting conditions.

Let's update the code to incorporate these changes:

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Condition Enforcement**: During the DP table updates, we now check if a condition exists for the current time `t`. If a condition exists, we only update the DP table for the city specified by the condition.
- **Conflict Handling**: If conflicting conditions are detected (i.e., two different cities required at the same time), we immediately append `0` to the results and break out of the loop for that test case.
- **Logic Correction**: The logic now correctly enforces conditions during the DP table updates, ensuring only valid paths are considered.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept revolves around dynamic programming and understanding how to efficiently calculate the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array given specific jump constraints. The problem tests the ability to manage state transitions based on conditions and constraints, which is a common pattern in dynamic programming problems.

    The successful strategy involved using a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. The key was to iterate over the indices in the order of increasing values, which ensures that when calculating `dp[i]`, all potential destination indices have already been processed. This ordering is crucial because it allows us to build the solution incrementally and ensures that the `dp` values are accurate when used to update other indices.

    One potential pitfall was ensuring that jumps only occur when the conditions are met (i.e., the starting index value is greater than the destination index value and all intermediate values). This was handled by breaking out of the loop when a jump was not possible, which prevents unnecessary calculations and maintains the integrity of the `dp` values.

    Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of ordering and state management in dynamic programming, especially when dealing with constraints that affect transitions between states. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.

- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7$10^9+7$.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Ryan is in a country with N cities connected by M bidirectional roads. He starts in city 1 and has K seconds to move between cities. He can either move to an adjacent city or stay in the current city each second. Ryan has Q conditions specifying that he must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. We need to determine how many different trips Ryan can make that satisfy all conditions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp[t][c]` where `t` is the time in seconds and `c` is the city. `dp[t][c]` will store the number of ways to reach city `c` at time `t`.

3. **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0][1] = 1` because Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0. All other `dp[0][c]` should be 0 for `c != 1`.

4. **DP Transition**: For each second `t` from 1 to K, update `dp[t][c]` for each city `c` by considering:
   - Staying in the same city: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][c]`
   - Moving from an adjacent city `u` to `c`: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][u]` for each `u` connected to `c`.

5. **Condition Checking**: After filling the DP table, check if the conditions `(a_i, b_i)` are satisfied. If any condition is not satisfied, the number of valid trips is 0.

6. **Result Calculation**: If all conditions are satisfied, the result is the sum of all valid paths that satisfy the conditions.

7. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of cities, roads, and seconds.
   - Build the graph using adjacency lists.
   - Initialize the DP table.
   - Fill the DP table using the transition rules.
   - Check the conditions.
   - Calculate the result and apply modulo.
3. Output the results for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there is no output detected. This usually indicates an issue with how the input is read or how the output is printed. The function `solve()` is defined but not called, which means the code that processes the input and produces the output is never executed.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function should be called to execute the logic. This is a common oversight when defining functions for competitive programming problems.

3. **Logic Verification**: The logic for filling the DP table and checking conditions seems correct based on the problem description. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify if the logic is indeed correct.

4. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the logic correctly handles edge cases, such as when there are no conditions (`Q = 0`), which seems to be handled by the current logic.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly in the DP table updates and the final result calculation.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called. Let's update the code to include this call and verify the logic:

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])

                # Move from adjacent cities
                for u in graph[c]:
                    dp[t][c] = (dp[t][c] + dp[t - 1][u]) % MOD

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Understanding the Output**: The feedback indicates that the output is `['28', '28', '28']` for all test cases, which suggests that the logic for handling conditions is not correctly implemented or applied.

2. **Condition Handling**: The conditions `(a_i, b_i)` specify that Ryan must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. The current implementation checks if `dp[b][a]` is non-zero for each condition, but it does not ensure that these conditions are the only constraints applied to the DP table.

3. **DP Table Calculation**: The DP table is being filled correctly, but the conditions are not being enforced during the DP table updates. Instead, they are only checked after the table is filled, which is incorrect.

4. **Logic Error**: The logic should enforce the conditions while filling the DP table, ensuring that only paths that satisfy all conditions are considered.

### Steps to Fix the Solution:

1. **Enforce Conditions During DP Calculation**: Modify the DP table updates to only allow transitions that satisfy the conditions. This means that if a condition specifies that Ryan must be in city `a_i` at time `b_i`, then `dp[b_i][a_i]` should be the only valid state at that time.

2. **Recalculate Valid Paths**: After enforcing the conditions, recalculate the number of valid paths that satisfy all conditions.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly handles cases where no valid paths exist due to conflicting conditions.

Let's update the code to incorporate these changes:

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Condition Enforcement**: During the DP table updates, we now check if a condition exists for the current time `t`. If a condition exists, we only update the DP table for the city specified by the condition.
- **Conflict Handling**: If conflicting conditions are detected (i.e., two different cities required at the same time), we immediately append `0` to the results and break out of the loop for that test case.
- **Logic Correction**: The logic now correctly enforces conditions during the DP table updates, ensuring only valid paths are considered.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] In tackling the problem of determining the number of valid trips Ryan can make between cities while satisfying specific conditions, the core concept was to use dynamic programming (DP) to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second. The problem required careful handling of conditions that specified where Ryan must be at certain times.

### Key Concepts:
- **Graph Representation**: Cities and roads were represented as a graph using adjacency lists, which allowed efficient traversal and updates.
- **Dynamic Programming**: A DP table `dp[t][c]` was used to store the number of ways to reach city `c` at time `t`. The transitions considered staying in the same city or moving to an adjacent city.

### Strategies and Fixes:
- **Initial Oversight**: The initial solution did not enforce conditions during the DP table updates, leading to incorrect results. Conditions were only checked after the table was filled, which was insufficient.
- **Condition Enforcement**: The solution was corrected by enforcing conditions during the DP updates. If a condition specified a city at a certain time, only that city was updated in the DP table for that time.
- **Conflict Handling**: The solution also accounted for conflicting conditions by immediately returning 0 if two different cities were required at the same time.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Function Execution**: Ensure that the main function is called to execute the logic, especially in competitive programming settings.
- **Condition Handling in DP**: When conditions are part of the problem, they should be integrated into the DP logic rather than checked post hoc.
- **Debugging**: The process highlighted the importance of verifying that all constraints are correctly applied during the computation, not just checked at the end. 

This experience reinforced the importance of integrating constraints directly into the dynamic programming logic and ensuring that all parts of the solution are executed as intended.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N$N$, M$M$ and K$K$.
- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7$10^9+7$.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Ryan is in a country with N cities connected by M bidirectional roads. He starts in city 1 and has K seconds to move between cities. He can either move to an adjacent city or stay in the current city each second. Ryan has Q conditions specifying that he must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. We need to determine how many different trips Ryan can make that satisfy all conditions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp[t][c]` where `t` is the time in seconds and `c` is the city. `dp[t][c]` will store the number of ways to reach city `c` at time `t`.

3. **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0][1] = 1` because Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0. All other `dp[0][c]` should be 0 for `c != 1`.

4. **DP Transition**: For each second `t` from 1 to K, update `dp[t][c]` for each city `c` by considering:
   - Staying in the same city: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][c]`
   - Moving from an adjacent city `u` to `c`: `dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][u]` for each `u` connected to `c`.

5. **Condition Checking**: After filling the DP table, check if the conditions `(a_i, b_i)` are satisfied. If any condition is not satisfied, the number of valid trips is 0.

6. **Result Calculation**: If all conditions are satisfied, the result is the sum of all valid paths that satisfy the conditions.

7. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of cities, roads, and seconds.
   - Build the graph using adjacency lists.
   - Initialize the DP table.
   - Fill the DP table using the transition rules.
   - Check the conditions.
   - Calculate the result and apply modulo.
3. Output the results for each test case.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The feedback suggests that there is no output detected. This usually indicates an issue with how the input is read or how the output is printed. The function `solve()` is defined but not called, which means the code that processes the input and produces the output is never executed.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function should be called to execute the logic. This is a common oversight when defining functions for competitive programming problems.

3. **Logic Verification**: The logic for filling the DP table and checking conditions seems correct based on the problem description. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify if the logic is indeed correct.

4. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the logic correctly handles edge cases, such as when there are no conditions (`Q = 0`), which seems to be handled by the current logic.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly in the DP table updates and the final result calculation.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called. Let's update the code to include this call and verify the logic:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Understanding the Output**: The feedback indicates that the output is `['28', '28', '28']` for all test cases, which suggests that the logic for handling conditions is not correctly implemented or applied.

2. **Condition Handling**: The conditions `(a_i, b_i)` specify that Ryan must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. The current implementation checks if `dp[b][a]` is non-zero for each condition, but it does not ensure that these conditions are the only constraints applied to the DP table.

3. **DP Table Calculation**: The DP table is being filled correctly, but the conditions are not being enforced during the DP table updates. Instead, they are only checked after the table is filled, which is incorrect.

4. **Logic Error**: The logic should enforce the conditions while filling the DP table, ensuring that only paths that satisfy all conditions are considered.

### Steps to Fix the Solution:

1. **Enforce Conditions During DP Calculation**: Modify the DP table updates to only allow transitions that satisfy the conditions. This means that if a condition specifies that Ryan must be in city `a_i` at time `b_i`, then `dp[b_i][a_i]` should be the only valid state at that time.

2. **Recalculate Valid Paths**: After enforcing the conditions, recalculate the number of valid paths that satisfy all conditions.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly handles cases where no valid paths exist due to conflicting conditions.

Let's update the code to incorporate these changes:

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Condition Enforcement**: During the DP table updates, we now check if a condition exists for the current time `t`. If a condition exists, we only update the DP table for the city specified by the condition.
- **Conflict Handling**: If conflicting conditions are detected (i.e., two different cities required at the same time), we immediately append `0` to the results and break out of the loop for that test case.
- **Logic Correction**: The logic now correctly enforces conditions during the DP table updates, ensuring only valid paths are considered.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

1. **Graph Representation**: Both my solution and the official solution effectively use a graph representation to model the cities and roads. This is crucial for understanding the connectivity and possible movements between cities.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The use of a dynamic programming (DP) table to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second is a common strategy in both solutions. This approach efficiently handles the constraints of time and space, given the problem's limits.

3. **Condition Enforcement**: The official solution enforces conditions directly in the DP table by setting specific entries to zero or one based on the conditions. This ensures that only valid paths are considered during the DP updates. My initial solution failed to enforce conditions during the DP updates, which led to incorrect results.

4. **Efficiency and Simplicity**: The official solution is concise and efficiently updates the DP table by iterating backward from the last second to the first. This backward iteration ensures that the conditions are applied correctly and simplifies the logic for updating the DP table.

5. **Handling Conflicts**: The official solution implicitly handles conflicts by setting the DP table entries to zero when conditions cannot be met, effectively pruning invalid paths early in the computation.

In summary, the official solution provides a more streamlined and efficient approach to enforcing conditions and updating the DP table. The key takeaway is the importance of integrating condition checks directly into the DP update process to ensure only valid paths are considered, which can significantly simplify the logic and improve performance.

[Problem]
    Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
    Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
    Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
    - The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N$N$, M$M$ and K$K$.
    - Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
    - The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
    - Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7$10^9+7$.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1â‰¤Tâ‰¤50$1 \le T \le 50$
    - 1â‰¤N,M,K,Qâ‰¤9,000$1 \le N, M, K, Q \le 9,000$
    - 1â‰¤ui,viâ‰¤N$1 \le u_i, v_i \le N$ for each valid i$i$
    - uiâ‰ vi$u_i \neq v_i$ for each valid i$i$
    - there is at most one road between each pair of cities
    - each city is reachable from every other city
    - 1â‰¤aiâ‰¤N$1 \le a_i \le N$ for each valid i$i$
    - 0â‰¤biâ‰¤K$0 \le b_i \le K$ for each valid i$i$
    - the sum of N$N$ over all test cases does not exceed 9,000$9,000$
    - the sum of K$K$ over all test cases does not exceed 9,000$9,000$
    - the sum of M$M$ over all test cases does not exceed 9,000$9,000$
    - the sum of Q$Q$ over all test cases does not exceed 9,000$9,000$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (20 points):
    - the sum of N$N$ over all test cases does not exceed 400$400$
    - the sum of K$K$ over all test cases does not exceed 400$400$
    - the sum of M$M$ over all test cases does not exceed 400$400$
    - the sum of Q$Q$ over all test cases does not exceed 400$400$
    Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints
