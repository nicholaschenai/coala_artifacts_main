## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Golomb sequence $G_1, G_2, \ldots$ is a non-decreasing integer sequence such that for each positive integer $n$, $G_n$ is the number of occurrences of $n$ in this sequence. The first few elements of $G$ are $[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, \ldots]$. Do you know the recurrence relation for the Golomb sequence? It is $G_1 = 1$ and $G_{n+1} = 1+G_{n+1-G_{G_n}}$ for each $n \ge 1$. A self-describing sequence, isn't it?
Mr. Strange wants to learn CP, so he asked Chef, who is one of the best competitive programmers in the world, to teach him. Chef decided to test his ability by giving him the following task.
Find the sum of squares of the $L$-th through $R$-th term of the Golomb sequence, i.e. $S = \sum_{i=L}^R G_i^2$. Since the sum can be quite large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.
Can you help Mr. Strange carry out this task given to him by his teacher?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer $S$ modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le L \le R \le 10^{10}$

INFO - [Task id] 911 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to compute the sum of squares of specific terms in the Golomb sequence for multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined such that each term \( G_n \) is the number of times the integer \( n \) appears in the sequence. The sequence starts with \( G_1 = 1 \) and follows the recurrence relation \( G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n+1-G_{G_n}} \). For each test case, given two integers \( L \) and \( R \), we need to find the sum of squares of the terms from \( G_L \) to \( G_R \) modulo \( 10^9+7 \).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Golomb Sequence**: The sequence is self-describing, meaning each number \( n \) appears \( G_n \) times. For example, 1 appears once, 2 appears twice, 3 appears three times, and so on.

2. **Efficient Calculation**: Direct computation of the Golomb sequence up to very large numbers (like \( 10^{10} \)) is impractical. Instead, we need a way to determine the value of \( G_n \) without generating the entire sequence.

3. **Precompute Values**: Precompute the Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit where we can determine the range of numbers that each \( G_n \) covers. This will help us quickly determine the value of \( G_n \) for any \( n \).

4. **Use Precomputed Data**: For each test case, use the precomputed data to find the values of \( G_L \) to \( G_R \) and compute the sum of their squares.

5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, compute the sum modulo \( 10^9+7 \).

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a list `golomb` with the first element as 1.
2. Precompute the Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit:
   - For each \( n \) from 2 to a large number:
     - Calculate \( G_n \) using the recurrence relation.
     - Append \( G_n \) to the `golomb` list.
     - Track the range of indices each \( G_n \) covers.
3. For each test case:
   - Read \( L \) and \( R \).
   - Initialize `sum_squares` to 0.
   - For each index from \( L \) to \( R \):
     - Determine the value of \( G_i \) using the precomputed data.
     - Add \( G_i^2 \) to `sum_squares`.
   - Output `sum_squares` modulo \( 10^9+7 \).

## Final Python Solution

```python
def precompute_golomb(limit):
    golomb = [0] * (limit + 1)
    golomb[1] = 1
    current_value = 1
    current_count = 1
    for n in range(2, limit + 1):
        if current_count == golomb[current_value]:
            current_value += 1
            current_count = 0
        golomb[n] = current_value
        current_count += 1
    return golomb

def find_golomb_value(n, golomb, max_precomputed):
    if n <= max_precomputed:
        return golomb[n]
    # For n > max_precomputed, we need to find the value using the pattern
    # This is a simplified approach assuming we have a large enough precomputed range
    # In practice, this would require a more complex logic to handle very large n
    # But for the sake of this problem, we assume we can handle it with precomputed data
    return golomb[max_precomputed]  # Simplified assumption

def sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, max_precomputed):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    sum_squares = 0
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        g_i = find_golomb_value(i, golomb, max_precomputed)
        sum_squares = (sum_squares + g_i * g_i) % MOD
    return sum_squares

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read

        R = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit
    max_precomputed = 1000000  # This is a chosen limit for precomputation
    golomb = precompute_golomb(max_precomputed)
    
    results = []
    for L, R in queries:
        result = sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, max_precomputed)
        results.append(result)

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

        1. **Reading Input**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach, but we need to ensure that the input is being processed correctly.

        2. **Output**: The code appends results to a list and then writes them all at once using `sys.stdout.write()`. This should work, but we need to ensure that the results are being computed and stored correctly.

        3. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is likely the reason why no output is being produced. The function needs to be called to execute the logic.

        4. **Logic and Computation**: The logic for computing the number of subsets seems correct based on the problem statement. However, we need to ensure that the precomputation of factorials and inverses is correct and that the binomial coefficient and power of two calculations are accurate.

        5. **Edge Cases**: We should ensure that edge cases, such as when \(K > I\), are handled correctly by returning 0.

        Let's fix the issue by ensuring the `solve()` function is called and verify the logic step-by-step.

        Here's the corrected code:

        ```python
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
            factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverse_factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    
            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD
    
            inverse_factorial[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD - 2, MOD)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverse_factorial[i] = inverse_factorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD
    
            return factorial, inverse_factorial

            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % MOD * inverse_factorial[n - k] % MOD

        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])

                N = int(data[index])
                Q = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                for _ in range(Q):
                    I = int(data[index])
                    K = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        binom = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorial, inverse_factorial)
                        power_of_two = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = binom * power_of_two % MOD
                        results.append(result)

        # Call the solve function to execute the solution
        solve()
        ```

        ### Key Fixes:
        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
        - **Verification**: Double-checked the logic for computing binomial coefficients and powers of two to ensure correctness.

INFO - [Task id] 911 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence from the L-th to the R-th term for multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined such that each number n appears exactly G_n times in the sequence. The sequence starts with G_1 = 1, and for n ≥ 1, G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n+1-G_{G_n}}. The result should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Golomb Sequence**: The Golomb sequence is a self-describing sequence where each number n appears exactly G_n times. The sequence starts with 1, and each subsequent number is determined by the recurrence relation.

2. **Efficient Calculation**: Direct computation of the Golomb sequence up to very large indices (like \(10^{10}\)) is impractical. Instead, we need a way to efficiently determine the value of G_n for large n.

3. **Precomputation**: Precompute the Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit where the sequence values stabilize or repeat in a predictable pattern. This will help in quickly determining G_n for large n.

4. **Summation of Squares**: For each test case, compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence values from L to R, and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function to precompute the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit.
2. For each test case:
   - Determine the Golomb sequence values for indices L to R.
   - Compute the sum of squares of these values.
   - Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Python Code

```python
def precompute_golomb_sequence(limit):
    golomb = [0] * (limit + 1)
    golomb[1] = 1
    for n in range(2, limit + 1):
        golomb[n] = 1 + golomb[n - golomb[golomb[n - 1]]]
    return golomb

def sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD):
    sum_squares = 0
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        sum_squares = (sum_squares + golomb[i] * golomb[i]) % MOD
    return sum_squares

### Explanation

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Golomb sequence $G_1, G_2, \ldots$ is a non-decreasing integer sequence such that for each positive integer $n$, $G_n$ is the number of occurrences of $n$ in this sequence. The first few elements of $G$ are $[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, \ldots]$. Do you know the recurrence relation for the Golomb sequence? It is $G_1 = 1$ and $G_{n+1} = 1+G_{n+1-G_{G_n}}$ for each $n \ge 1$. A self-describing sequence, isn't it?
Mr. Strange wants to learn CP, so he asked Chef, who is one of the best competitive programmers in the world, to teach him. Chef decided to test his ability by giving him the following task.
Find the sum of squares of the $L$-th through $R$-th term of the Golomb sequence, i.e. $S = \sum_{i=L}^R G_i^2$. Since the sum can be quite large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.
Can you help Mr. Strange carry out this task given to him by his teacher?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer $S$ modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le L \le R \le 10^{10}$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (50 points):
- $T \le 10^2$
- $R \le 10^9$
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
3
1 5
2 4
100 100

-----Example Output-----
27
17
441

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: $1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = 27$
Example case 2: $2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 17$
Example case 3: $21^2 = 441$

INFO - [Task id] 911 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't handle large values of R efficiently. The precomputation is limited to a certain range, and for values of R beyond this range, the solution doesn't compute the Golomb sequence correctly. Additionally, the solution doesn't output any results because the function `solve()` is not called.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called to execute the solution.

2. **Efficient Calculation for Large R**: The current approach only precomputes the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit. For large R, we need a more efficient way to compute the Golomb sequence values without directly iterating up to R.

3. **Output Handling**: Ensure that the results are correctly written to standard output.

### Revised Solution

To address these issues, we need to:

- Call the `solve()` function to ensure the solution is executed.
- Implement a more efficient method to handle large R values, possibly by recognizing patterns or using mathematical properties of the Golomb sequence.

Here's the revised code:

```python
def precompute_golomb_sequence(limit):
    golomb = [0] * (limit + 1)
    golomb[1] = 1
    for n in range(2, limit + 1):
        golomb[n] = 1 + golomb[n - golomb[golomb[n - 1]]]
    return golomb

def sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD):
    sum_squares = 0
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        sum_squares = (sum_squares + golomb[i] * golomb[i]) % MOD
    return sum_squares

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    T = int(data[0])
    queries = []
    max_r = 0
    
    index = 1
    for _ in range(T):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((L, R))
        max_r = max(max_r, R)
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit
    # We choose a limit based on practical constraints, e.g., 10^6
    limit = min(max_r, 10**6)
    golomb = precompute_golomb_sequence(limit)
    
    results = []
    for L, R in queries:
        if R <= limit:
            result = sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD)
        else:
            # For very large R, we need a different approach
            # This is a placeholder for handling large R efficiently
            result = 0  # Placeholder, needs a more efficient approach for large R
        results.append(result)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

# Call the solve function to execute the solution
solve()
```

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the solution is executed.
- **Handling Large R**: The current solution still uses a placeholder for large R values. A more efficient approach is needed to handle these cases, potentially involving mathematical insights into the Golomb sequence. This part of the solution requires further development to be fully functional.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Golomb sequence $G_1, G_2, \ldots$ is a non-decreasing integer sequence such that for each positive integer $n$, $G_n$ is the number of occurrences of $n$ in this sequence. The first few elements of $G$ are $[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, \ldots]$. Do you know the recurrence relation for the Golomb sequence? It is $G_1 = 1$ and $G_{n+1} = 1+G_{n+1-G_{G_n}}$ for each $n \ge 1$. A self-describing sequence, isn't it?
Mr. Strange wants to learn CP, so he asked Chef, who is one of the best competitive programmers in the world, to teach him. Chef decided to test his ability by giving him the following task.
Find the sum of squares of the $L$-th through $R$-th term of the Golomb sequence, i.e. $S = \sum_{i=L}^R G_i^2$. Since the sum can be quite large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.
Can you help Mr. Strange carry out this task given to him by his teacher?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer $S$ modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le L \le R \le 10^{10}$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (50 points):
- $T \le 10^2$
- $R \le 10^9$
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
3
1 5
2 4
100 100

-----Example Output-----
27
17
441

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: $1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = 27$
Example case 2: $2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 17$
Example case 3: $21^2 = 441$

INFO - [Task id] 911 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence from the L-th to the R-th term for multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined such that each number n appears exactly G_n times in the sequence. The sequence starts with G_1 = 1, and for n ≥ 1, G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n+1-G_{G_n}}. The result should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Golomb Sequence**: The Golomb sequence is a self-describing sequence where each number n appears exactly G_n times. The sequence starts with 1, and each subsequent number is determined by the recurrence relation.

2. **Efficient Calculation**: Direct computation of the Golomb sequence up to very large indices (like \(10^{10}\)) is impractical. Instead, we need a way to efficiently determine the value of G_n for large n.

3. **Precomputation**: Precompute the Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit where the sequence values stabilize or repeat in a predictable pattern. This will help in quickly determining G_n for large n.

4. **Summation of Squares**: For each test case, compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence values from L to R, and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function to precompute the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit.
2. For each test case:
   - Determine the Golomb sequence values for indices L to R.
   - Compute the sum of squares of these values.
   - Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Python Code

```python
def precompute_golomb_sequence(limit):
    golomb = [0] * (limit + 1)
    golomb[1] = 1
    for n in range(2, limit + 1):
        golomb[n] = 1 + golomb[n - golomb[golomb[n - 1]]]
    return golomb

def sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD):
    sum_squares = 0
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        sum_squares = (sum_squares + golomb[i] * golomb[i]) % MOD
    return sum_squares

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    T = int(data[0])
    queries = []
    max_r = 0
    
    index = 1
    for _ in range(T):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((L, R))
        max_r = max(max_r, R)
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit
    # We choose a limit based on practical constraints, e.g., 10^6
    limit = min(max_r, 10**6)
    golomb = precompute_golomb_sequence(limit)
    
    results = []
    for L, R in queries:
        if R <= limit:
            result = sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD)
        else:
            # For very large R, we need a different approach
            # This is a placeholder for handling large R efficiently
            result = 0  # Placeholder, needs a more efficient approach for large R
        results.append(result)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

```

### Explanation

- **Precomputation**: We precompute the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit (e.g., \(10^6\)) to handle queries efficiently.
- **Sum of Squares**: For each query, we compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence values from L to R.
- **Handling Large R**: The current solution handles R up to the precomputed limit. For larger R, a more efficient approach is needed, possibly involving pattern recognition or mathematical properties of the sequence.

INFO - [Task id] 911 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't handle large values of R efficiently. The precomputation is limited to a certain range, and for values of R beyond this range, the solution doesn't compute the Golomb sequence correctly. Additionally, the solution doesn't output any results because the function `solve()` is not called.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called to execute the solution.

2. **Efficient Calculation for Large R**: The current approach only precomputes the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit. For large R, we need a more efficient way to compute the Golomb sequence values without directly iterating up to R.

3. **Output Handling**: Ensure that the results are correctly written to standard output.

### Revised Solution

To address these issues, we need to:

- Call the `solve()` function to ensure the solution is executed.
- Implement a more efficient method to handle large R values, possibly by recognizing patterns or using mathematical properties of the Golomb sequence.

Here's the revised code:

```python
def precompute_golomb_sequence(limit):
    golomb = [0] * (limit + 1)
    golomb[1] = 1
    for n in range(2, limit + 1):
        golomb[n] = 1 + golomb[n - golomb[golomb[n - 1]]]
    return golomb

def sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD):
    sum_squares = 0
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        sum_squares = (sum_squares + golomb[i] * golomb[i]) % MOD
    return sum_squares

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    T = int(data[0])
    queries = []
    max_r = 0
    
    index = 1
    for _ in range(T):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((L, R))
        max_r = max(max_r, R)
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit
    # We choose a limit based on practical constraints, e.g., 10^6
    limit = min(max_r, 10**6)
    golomb = precompute_golomb_sequence(limit)
    
    results = []
    for L, R in queries:
        if R <= limit:
            result = sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD)
        else:
            # For very large R, we need a different approach
            # This is a placeholder for handling large R efficiently
            result = 0  # Placeholder, needs a more efficient approach for large R
        results.append(result)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

# Call the solve function to execute the solution
solve()
```

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the solution is executed.
- **Handling Large R**: The current solution still uses a placeholder for large R values. A more efficient approach is needed to handle these cases, potentially involving mathematical insights into the Golomb sequence. This part of the solution requires further development to be fully functional.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Prefix Sum Optimization**: My approach used a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.

    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.

    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.

    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Golomb sequence $G_1, G_2, \ldots$ is a non-decreasing integer sequence such that for each positive integer $n$, $G_n$ is the number of occurrences of $n$ in this sequence. The first few elements of $G$ are $[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, \ldots]$. Do you know the recurrence relation for the Golomb sequence? It is $G_1 = 1$ and $G_{n+1} = 1+G_{n+1-G_{G_n}}$ for each $n \ge 1$. A self-describing sequence, isn't it?
Mr. Strange wants to learn CP, so he asked Chef, who is one of the best competitive programmers in the world, to teach him. Chef decided to test his ability by giving him the following task.
Find the sum of squares of the $L$-th through $R$-th term of the Golomb sequence, i.e. $S = \sum_{i=L}^R G_i^2$. Since the sum can be quite large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.
Can you help Mr. Strange carry out this task given to him by his teacher?

INFO - [Task id] 911 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence from the L-th to the R-th term for multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined such that each number n appears exactly G_n times in the sequence. The sequence starts with G_1 = 1, and for n ≥ 1, G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n+1-G_{G_n}}. The result should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Golomb Sequence**: The Golomb sequence is a self-describing sequence where each number n appears exactly G_n times. The sequence starts with 1, and each subsequent number is determined by the recurrence relation.

2. **Efficient Calculation**: Direct computation of the Golomb sequence up to very large indices (like \(10^{10}\)) is impractical. Instead, we need a way to efficiently determine the value of G_n for large n.

3. **Precomputation**: Precompute the Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit where the sequence values stabilize or repeat in a predictable pattern. This will help in quickly determining G_n for large n.

4. **Summation of Squares**: For each test case, compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence values from L to R, and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function to precompute the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit.
2. For each test case:
   - Determine the Golomb sequence values for indices L to R.
   - Compute the sum of squares of these values.
   - Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Python Code

```python
def precompute_golomb_sequence(limit):
    golomb = [0] * (limit + 1)
    golomb[1] = 1
    for n in range(2, limit + 1):
        golomb[n] = 1 + golomb[n - golomb[golomb[n - 1]]]
    return golomb

def sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD):
    sum_squares = 0
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        sum_squares = (sum_squares + golomb[i] * golomb[i]) % MOD
    return sum_squares

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    T = int(data[0])
    queries = []
    max_r = 0
    
    index = 1
    for _ in range(T):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((L, R))
        max_r = max(max_r, R)
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit
    # We choose a limit based on practical constraints, e.g., 10^6
    limit = min(max_r, 10**6)
    golomb = precompute_golomb_sequence(limit)
    
    results = []
    for L, R in queries:
        if R <= limit:
            result = sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD)
        else:
            # For very large R, we need a different approach
            # This is a placeholder for handling large R efficiently
            result = 0  # Placeholder, needs a more efficient approach for large R
        results.append(result)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

```

### Explanation

- **Precomputation**: We precompute the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit (e.g., \(10^6\)) to handle queries efficiently.
- **Sum of Squares**: For each query, we compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence values from L to R.
- **Handling Large R**: The current solution handles R up to the precomputed limit. For larger R, a more efficient approach is needed, possibly involving pattern recognition or mathematical properties of the sequence.

INFO - [Task id] 911 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't handle large values of R efficiently. The precomputation is limited to a certain range, and for values of R beyond this range, the solution doesn't compute the Golomb sequence correctly. Additionally, the solution doesn't output any results because the function `solve()` is not called.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called to execute the solution.

2. **Efficient Calculation for Large R**: The current approach only precomputes the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit. For large R, we need a more efficient way to compute the Golomb sequence values without directly iterating up to R.

3. **Output Handling**: Ensure that the results are correctly written to standard output.

### Revised Solution

To address these issues, we need to:

- Call the `solve()` function to ensure the solution is executed.
- Implement a more efficient method to handle large R values, possibly by recognizing patterns or using mathematical properties of the Golomb sequence.

Here's the revised code:

```python
def precompute_golomb_sequence(limit):
    golomb = [0] * (limit + 1)
    golomb[1] = 1
    for n in range(2, limit + 1):
        golomb[n] = 1 + golomb[n - golomb[golomb[n - 1]]]
    return golomb

def sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD):
    sum_squares = 0
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        sum_squares = (sum_squares + golomb[i] * golomb[i]) % MOD
    return sum_squares

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    T = int(data[0])
    queries = []
    max_r = 0
    
    index = 1
    for _ in range(T):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((L, R))
        max_r = max(max_r, R)
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit
    # We choose a limit based on practical constraints, e.g., 10^6
    limit = min(max_r, 10**6)
    golomb = precompute_golomb_sequence(limit)
    
    results = []
    for L, R in queries:
        if R <= limit:
            result = sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD)
        else:
            # For very large R, we need a different approach
            # This is a placeholder for handling large R efficiently
            result = 0  # Placeholder, needs a more efficient approach for large R
        results.append(result)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

# Call the solve function to execute the solution
solve()
```

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the solution is executed.
- **Handling Large R**: The current solution still uses a placeholder for large R values. A more efficient approach is needed to handle these cases, potentially involving mathematical insights into the Golomb sequence. This part of the solution requires further development to be fully functional.

### Explanation

- **Precomputation**: We precompute the Golomb sequence up to a limit of \(10^6\). This allows us to handle queries efficiently for smaller values of R.
- **Handling Large R**: The current solution still uses a placeholder for large R values. A more efficient approach is needed to handle these cases, potentially involving mathematical insights into the Golomb sequence. This part of the solution requires further development to be fully functional.

INFO - [Task id] 911 [generation text] In tackling the problem of computing the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence for large indices, the key challenge was efficiently handling large values of R, up to \(10^{10}\). The Golomb sequence is self-describing and grows slowly, which allows for precomputation up to a certain limit. Initially, the solution involved precomputing the sequence up to \(10^6\) and using these precomputed values for queries within this range.

The main insight was recognizing that the Golomb sequence's slow growth could be leveraged to handle larger indices without direct computation. This involved precomputing the sequence and using mathematical properties to estimate values beyond the precomputed range. However, the initial solution used a placeholder for large R values, indicating the need for further optimization.

The solution was structured to read input efficiently, precompute the sequence, and handle multiple test cases. The function `solve()` was called to ensure execution, and results were output using standard I/O. This approach worked well for smaller R values, but further development is needed for very large R values, potentially involving pattern recognition or mathematical insights into the sequence's behavior.

### Explanation

- **Handling Large R**: The current solution still uses a placeholder for large R values. A more efficient approach is needed to handle these cases, potentially involving mathematical insights into the Golomb sequence. This part of the solution requires further development to be fully functional.

INFO - [Task id] 911 [prompt] To address the problem of efficiently computing the Golomb sequence for large values of R, we need to implement a more efficient approach. The key is to recognize that the Golomb sequence grows slowly, and we can precompute it up to a certain point and use mathematical properties to handle larger indices.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
def precompute_golomb_sequence(limit):
    golomb = [0] * (limit + 1)
    golomb[1] = 1
    for n in range(2, limit + 1):
        golomb[n] = 1 + golomb[n - golomb[golomb[n - 1]]]
    return golomb

def sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD):
    sum_squares = 0
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        sum_squares = (sum_squares + golomb[i] * golomb[i]) % MOD
    return sum_squares

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    T = int(data[0])
    queries = []
    max_r = 0
    
    index = 1
    for _ in range(T):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((L, R))
        max_r = max(max_r, R)
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit
    # We choose a limit based on practical constraints, e.g., 10^6
    limit = 10**6
    golomb = precompute_golomb_sequence(limit)
    
    results = []
    for L, R in queries:
        if R <= limit:
            result = sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD)
        else:
            # For very large R, we need a different approach
            # This is a placeholder for handling large R efficiently
            # We can use the fact that Golomb sequence grows slowly
            # and use precomputed values to estimate larger indices
            result = 0  # Placeholder, needs a more efficient approach for large R

# Call the solve function to execute the solution

```

### Explanation

- **Precomputation**: We precompute the Golomb sequence up to a limit of \(10^6\). This allows us to handle queries efficiently for smaller values of R.
- **Handling Large R**: The current solution still uses a placeholder for large R values. A more efficient approach is needed to handle these cases, potentially involving mathematical insights into the Golomb sequence. This part of the solution requires further development to be fully functional.
- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is called to ensure the solution is executed.

This solution is structured to handle the problem efficiently for smaller values of R, but further optimization is needed for very large R values.

INFO - [Task id] 911 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem and Solution

The problem of computing the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence over a large range is challenging due to the constraints on L and R, which can be as large as \(10^{10}\). My initial approach involved precomputing the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit and using it directly for queries. However, this approach was not scalable for very large R values.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution

1. **Precomputation with Dynamic Programming**: The official solution uses dynamic programming to precompute the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit. This is similar to my approach but extends it by also precomputing cumulative sums and storing them in `prefix_storer`.

2. **Efficient Query Handling**: The solution uses a binary search (`find_upper_bound`) to efficiently find the range in the precomputed data that corresponds to the query range. This allows for quick computation of the sum of squares over large ranges without directly iterating through each element.

3. **Use of Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a prefix sum array (`prefix_storer`), the solution can quickly compute the sum of squares for any range [L, R] using the difference of prefix sums. This is a powerful technique that reduces the time complexity of range queries.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution consistently applies modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow, which is crucial given the constraints.

#### Lessons Learned

- **Precomputation and Prefix Sums**: Precomputing values and using prefix sums can significantly optimize range queries, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- **Binary Search for Range Queries**: Using binary search to find the appropriate indices in precomputed arrays can greatly enhance efficiency.
- **Handling Large Inputs**: For problems with large input constraints, it's essential to find ways to reduce the problem size through mathematical insights or data structures like prefix sums.

This problem reinforced the importance of efficient data handling and the use of mathematical properties to optimize solutions for large-scale problems.

[Problem]
    The Golomb sequence $G_1, G_2, \ldots$ is a non-decreasing integer sequence such that for each positive integer $n$, $G_n$ is the number of occurrences of $n$ in this sequence. The first few elements of $G$ are $[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, \ldots]$. Do you know the recurrence relation for the Golomb sequence? It is $G_1 = 1$ and $G_{n+1} = 1+G_{n+1-G_{G_n}}$ for each $n \ge 1$. A self-describing sequence, isn't it?
