The Golomb sequence is defined such that each term \\( G_n \\) is the number of times the integer \\( n \\) appears in the sequence. The sequence starts with \\( G_1 = 1 \\) and follows the recurrence relation \\( G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n+1-G_{G_n}} \\). For each test case, given two integers \\( L \\) and \\( R \\), we need to find the sum of squares of the terms from \\( G_L \\) to \\( G_R \\) modulo \\( 10^9+7 \\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Golomb Sequence**: The sequence is self-describing, meaning each number \\( n \\) appears \\( G_n \\) times. For example, 1 appears once, 2 appears twice, 3 appears three times, and so on.\n\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Direct computation of the Golomb sequence up to very large numbers (like \\( 10^{10} \\)) is impractical. Instead, we need a way to determine the value of \\( G_n \\) without generating the entire sequence.\n\n3. **Precompute Values**: Precompute the Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit where we can determine the range of numbers that each \\( G_n \\) covers. This will help us quickly determine the value of \\( G_n \\) for any \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Use Precomputed Data**: For each test case, use the precomputed data to find the values of \\( G_L \\) to \\( G_R \\) and compute the sum of their squares.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, compute the sum modulo \\( 10^9+7 \\).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1.

For each test case:\n   - Read \\( L \\) and \\( R \\).\n   - Initialize `sum_squares` to 0.\n   - For each index from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\):\n     - Determine the value of \\( G_i \\) using the precomputed data.\n     - Add \\( G_i^2 \\) to `sum_squares`.\n   - Output `sum_squares` modulo \\( 10^9+7 \\).\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef precompute_golomb(limit):\n    golomb = [0] * (limit + 1)\n    golomb[1] = 1\n    current_value = 1\n    current_count = 1\n    for n in range(2, limit + 1):\n        if current_count == golomb[current_value]:\n            current_value += 1\n            current_count = 0\n        golomb[n] = current_value\n        current_count += 1\n    return golomb\n\ndef find_golomb_value(n, golomb, max_precomputed):\n    if n <= max_precomputed:\n        return golomb[n]\n    # For n > max_precomputed, we need to find the value using the pattern\n    # This is a simplified approach assuming we have a large enough precomputed range\n    # In practice, this would require a more complex logic to handle very large n\n    # But for the sake of this problem, we assume we can handle it with precomputed data\n    return golomb[max_precomputed]  # Simplified assumption\n\ndef sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, max_precomputed):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for i in range(L, R + 1):\n        g_i = find_golomb_value(i, golomb, max_precomputed)\n        sum_squares = (sum_squares + g_i * g_i) % MOD\n    return sum_squares\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    queries = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(T):\n        L = int(data[index])\n        R = int(data[index + 1])\n        queries.append((L, R))\n        index += 2\n    \n    # Precompute Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit\n    max_precomputed = 1000000  # This is a chosen limit for precomputation\n    golomb = precompute_golomb(max_precomputed)\n    \n    results = []\n    for L, R in queries:\n        result = sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, max_precomputed)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```"

The precomputation is limited to a certain range, and for values of R beyond this range, the solution doesn't compute the Golomb sequence correctly. Additionally, the solution doesn't output any results because the function `solve()` is not called.\n\n### Steps to Correct the Solution\n\n1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called to execute the solution.\n\n2. **Efficient Calculation for Large R**: The current approach only precomputes the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit. For large R, we need a more efficient way to compute the Golomb sequence values without directly iterating up to R.\n\n3. **Output Handling**: Ensure that the results are correctly written to standard output.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\nTo address these issues, we need to:\n\n- Call the `solve()` function to ensure the solution is executed.\n- Implement a more efficient method to handle large R values, possibly by recognizing patterns or using mathematical properties of the Golomb sequence.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\ndef precompute_golomb_sequence(limit):\n    golomb = [0] * (limit + 1)\n    golomb[1] = 1\n    for n in range(2, limit + 1):\n        golomb[n] = 1 + golomb[n - golomb[golomb[n - 1]]]\n    return golomb\n\ndef sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for i in range(L, R + 1):\n        sum_squares = (sum_squares + golomb[i] * golomb[i]) % MOD\n    return sum_squares\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    T = int(data[0])\n    queries = []\n    max_r = 0\n    \n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(T):\n        L = int(data[index])\n        R = int(data[index + 1])\n        queries.append((L, R))\n        max_r = max(max_r, R)\n        index += 2\n    \n    # Precompute Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit\n    # We choose a limit based on practical constraints, e.g., 10^6\n    limit = min(max_r, 10**6)\n    golomb = precompute_golomb_sequence(limit)\n    \n    results = []\n    for L, R in queries:\n        if R <= limit:\n            result = sum_of_squares(L, R, golomb, MOD)\n        else:\n            # For very large R, we need a different approach\n            # This is a placeholder for handling large R efficiently\n            result = 0  # Placeholder, needs a more efficient approach for large R\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the solution\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure the solution is executed.\n- **Handling Large R**: The current solution still uses a placeholder for large R values. A more efficient approach is needed to handle these cases, potentially involving mathematical insights into the Golomb sequence. This part of the solution requires further development to be fully functional."

This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.\n\n    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.\n\n    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.\n\n    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

My initial approach involved precomputing the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit and using it directly for queries. However, this approach was not scalable for very large R values.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Precomputation with Dynamic Programming**: The official solution uses dynamic programming to precompute the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit. This is similar to my approach but extends it by also precomputing cumulative sums and storing them in `prefix_storer`.\n\n2. **Efficient Query Handling**: The solution uses a binary search (`find_upper_bound`) to efficiently find the range in the precomputed data that corresponds to the query range. This allows for quick computation of the sum of squares over large ranges without directly iterating through each element.\n\n3. **Use of Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a prefix sum array (`prefix_storer`), the solution can quickly compute the sum of squares for any range [L, R] using the difference of prefix sums. This is a powerful technique that reduces the time complexity of range queries.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution consistently applies modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow, which is crucial given the constraints.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Precomputation and Prefix Sums**: Precomputing values and using prefix sums can significantly optimize range queries, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n- **Binary Search for Range Queries**: Using binary search to find the appropriate indices in precomputed arrays can greatly enhance efficiency.\n- **Handling Large Inputs**: For problems with large input constraints, it's essential to find ways to reduce the problem size through mathematical insights or data structures like prefix sums.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of efficient data handling and the use of mathematical properties to optimize solutions for large-scale problems."

It first precomputes the Golomb sequence up to a specified limit to optimize the calculation of these sums. For each query, it checks if the upper bound R is within the precomputed limit and calculates the sum of squares using the precomputed Golomb sequence. If R exceeds the limit, it currently uses a placeholder for handling such cases, indicating the need for a more efficient approach for large R. Finally, it outputs the results for all queries.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to compute properties of the Golomb sequence, particularly when dealing with large ranges and constraints typical in competitive programming. The problem involves understanding the self-describing nature of the Golomb sequence and efficiently computing the sum of squares of its terms over a specified range. This is particularly relevant in situations where direct computation is infeasible due to large input sizes, requiring precomputation and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.
