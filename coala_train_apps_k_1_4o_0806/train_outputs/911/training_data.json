    "summary": "In tackling the problem of computing the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence for large indices, the key challenge was efficiently handling large values of R, up to \\(10^{10}\\). The Golomb sequence is self-describing and grows slowly, which allows for precomputation up to a certain limit. Initially, the solution involved precomputing the sequence up to \\(10^6\\) and using these precomputed values for queries within this range.\n\nThe main insight was recognizing that the Golomb sequence's slow growth could be leveraged to handle larger indices without direct computation. This involved precomputing the sequence and using mathematical properties to estimate values beyond the precomputed range. However, the initial solution used a placeholder for large R values, indicating the need for further optimization.\n\nThe solution was structured to read input efficiently, precompute the sequence, and handle multiple test cases. The function `solve()` was called to ensure execution, and results were output using standard I/O. This approach worked well for smaller R values, but further development is needed for very large R values, potentially involving pattern recognition or mathematical insights into the sequence's behavior.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\nThe problem of computing the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence over a large range is challenging due to the constraints on L and R, which can be as large as \\(10^{10}\\). My initial approach involved precomputing the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit and using it directly for queries. However, this approach was not scalable for very large R values.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Precomputation with Dynamic Programming**: The official solution uses dynamic programming to precompute the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit. This is similar to my approach but extends it by also precomputing cumulative sums and storing them in `prefix_storer`.\n\n2. **Efficient Query Handling**: The solution uses a binary search (`find_upper_bound`) to efficiently find the range in the precomputed data that corresponds to the query range. This allows for quick computation of the sum of squares over large ranges without directly iterating through each element.\n\n3. **Use of Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a prefix sum array (`prefix_storer`), the solution can quickly compute the sum of squares for any range [L, R] using the difference of prefix sums. This is a powerful technique that reduces the time complexity of range queries.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution consistently applies modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow, which is crucial given the constraints.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Precomputation and Prefix Sums**: Precomputing values and using prefix sums can significantly optimize range queries, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n- **Binary Search for Range Queries**: Using binary search to find the appropriate indices in precomputed arrays can greatly enhance efficiency.\n- **Handling Large Inputs**: For problems with large input constraints, it's essential to find ways to reduce the problem size through mathematical insights or data structures like prefix sums.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of efficient data handling and the use of mathematical properties to optimize solutions for large-scale problems.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThe function reads input data, which includes the number of queries and pairs of integers (L, R) for each query, and calculates the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence values between L and R, modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). It first precomputes the Golomb sequence up to a specified limit to optimize the calculation of these sums. For each query, it checks if the upper bound R is within the precomputed limit and calculates the sum of squares using the precomputed Golomb sequence. If R exceeds the limit, it currently uses a placeholder for handling such cases, indicating the need for a more efficient approach for large R. Finally, it outputs the results for all queries.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to compute properties of the Golomb sequence, particularly when dealing with large ranges and constraints typical in competitive programming. The problem involves understanding the self-describing nature of the Golomb sequence and efficiently computing the sum of squares of its terms over a specified range. This is particularly relevant in situations where direct computation is infeasible due to large input sizes, requiring precomputation and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers. The solution also highlights the importance of optimizing algorithms to handle up to 10^5 test cases efficiently, which is a common requirement in competitive programming and algorithm design."
