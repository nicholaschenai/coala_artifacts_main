If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of potential starting points of subarrays. The idea is to maintain a prefix sum array and use it to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray. The deque will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the array from the start up to index `i-1`.\n2. **Deque for Indices**: Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sum array. This will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray.\n3. **Iterate Over Prefix Sum**: For each element in the prefix sum array:\n   - Check if the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the index stored at the front of the deque is at least `K`. If it is, update the minimum length and remove the index from the deque.\n   - Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums by removing indices from the back if the current prefix sum is less than or equal to the prefix sum at those indices.\n   - Add the current index to the deque.\n4. **Return Result**: If a valid subarray is found, return its length; otherwise, return `-1`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction shortestSubarray(A, K):\n    n = length of A\n    prefix_sum = array of size n+1 initialized to 0\n    for i from 0 to n:\n        prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n    \n    deque = empty deque\n    min_length = infinity\n    \n    for i from 0 to n:\n        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= K:\n            min_length = min(min_length, i - deque[0])\n            remove front element from deque\n        \n        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]]:\n            remove back element from deque\n        \n        add i to deque\n    \n    if min_length is infinity:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return min_length\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubarray(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:\n        n = len(A)\n        # Step 1: Compute the prefix sum array\n        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n        \n        # Step 2: Initialize a deque to store indices and a variable for the minimum length\n        dq = deque()\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        \n        # Step 3: Iterate over the prefix sum array\n        for i in range(n + 1):\n            # Check if we can form a valid subarray with sum at least K\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:\n                min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())\n            \n            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:\n                dq.pop()\n            \n            # Add the current index to the deque\n            dq.append(i)\n        \n        # Step 4: Return the result\n        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K` using a combination of prefix sums and a deque to maintain potential starting indices. The time complexity is O(n) due to the linear traversal and deque operations."

The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.\n\n    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.\n\n    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            n = len(nums)\n            d = [1] * n\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is crucial for maintaining the order and quickly finding the shortest subarray with a sum of at least `K`.\n\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**\n   The official solution calculates the cumulative sum directly within the loop, which is slightly more efficient in terms of space compared to my approach where I precomputed a prefix sum array. This reduces the space complexity by not storing an additional array.\n\n3. **Handling Negative Numbers:**\n   The official solution explicitly handles negative numbers by removing any greater cumulative sums from the end of the deque. This ensures that the deque only contains potential candidates for forming the shortest subarray. This is a subtle but important optimization that ensures the deque only holds useful indices.\n\n4. **Result Initialization and Update:**\n   The official solution initializes the result as `len(A) + 1` and updates it only when a valid subarray is found. This is a straightforward way to handle the case where no valid subarray exists, as it simply checks if the result is still greater than the length of the array.\n\n5. **Code Simplicity:**\n   The official solution is concise and avoids unnecessary complexity. It directly manipulates the cumulative sum and deque, making the logic clear and easy to follow.\n\nOverall, the official solution is slightly more efficient in terms of space and handles edge cases more explicitly, particularly with negative numbers. This reflection highlights the importance of considering edge cases and optimizing space usage in algorithm design."

The function iterates through the prefix sum array, updating the minimum subarray length whenever a valid subarray is found.

It is particularly relevant when dealing with large datasets where a brute force approach would be inefficient. The use of prefix sums and a deque to maintain a sliding window of potential subarray start points is a powerful technique that can be applied to other problems involving subarrays and sum constraints. This approach is efficient and can handle large input sizes due to its linear time complexity, making it suitable for real-time data processing or applications where performance is critical."
