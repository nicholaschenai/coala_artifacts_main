    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given list `A` such that the sum of its elements is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray. The idea is to maintain a prefix sum array and use a deque to store indices of the prefix sums. As we iterate through the array, we calculate the prefix sum and check if the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the front of the deque is at least `K`. If it is, we update the minimum length of the subarray. We also ensure that the deque is maintained in a way that the prefix sums are in increasing order, which helps in efficiently finding the shortest subarray.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a prefix sum array with an initial value of 0\n   Initialize a deque to store indices of the prefix sums\n   Set min_length to infinity\n\n   For each index i in the array A:\n       Calculate the current prefix sum\n       While the deque is not empty and the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the front of the deque is at least K:\n           Update min_length with the minimum of its current value and the difference between the current index and the index at the front of the deque\n           Remove the front element from the deque\n       While the deque is not empty and the current prefix sum is less than or equal to the prefix sum at the back of the deque:\n           Remove the back element from the deque\n       Add the current index to the deque\n\n   If min_length is still infinity, return -1\n   Otherwise, return min_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubarray(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize prefix sum array with an initial value of 0\n        prefix_sum = [0]\n        for num in A:\n            prefix_sum.append(prefix_sum[-1] + num)\n        \n        # Initialize a deque to store indices of the prefix sums\n        dq = deque()\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        \n        # Iterate over each index in the prefix sum array\n        for i in range(len(prefix_sum)):\n            # Check if we can find a valid subarray with sum at least K\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:\n                min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())\n            \n            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:\n                dq.pop()\n            \n            # Add the current index to the deque\n            dq.append(i)\n        \n        # If min_length is still infinity, no valid subarray was found\n        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the shortest subarray with a sum of at least `K` using a sliding window approach with a deque, ensuring optimal performance.",
