        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a number of queries, Q. Each query consists of two integers, N and K. For each query, we need to calculate the sum S(N, K) which is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers modulo K. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n- F(0) = 0\n- F(1) = 1\n- F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2) for i >= 2\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so calculating it directly for large N is inefficient. However, we only need the sum modulo K, which can be simplified using properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n2. **Use Pisano Period**: The Fibonacci sequence modulo any number K is periodic, known as the Pisano period. This means that after a certain number of terms, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo K repeats. We can use this property to reduce the computation for large N.\n\n3. **Calculate Pisano Period**: For each query, calculate the Pisano period for the given K. This will help us determine how the Fibonacci sequence behaves under modulo K.\n\n4. **Sum within Pisano Period**: Once the Pisano period is known, calculate the sum of Fibonacci numbers within one full period. Use this to compute the sum for N terms by considering how many full periods fit into N and the remainder.\n\n5. **Compute Result for Each Query**: For each query, use the Pisano period and the precomputed sums to quickly calculate the result S(N, K).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction pisano_period(k):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i from 0 to k*k:\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % k\n        if a == 0 and b == 1:\n            return i + 1\n\nfunction fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):\n    period = pisano_period(k)\n    full_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    fib_mod = [0, 1]\n    for i from 2 to period:\n        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)\n    \n    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k\n    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k\n    \n    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k\n\nfunction main():\n    read Q\n    for each query:\n        read N, K\n        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)\n        print result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef pisano_period(k):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in range(k * k):\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % k\n        if a == 0 and b == 1:\n            return i + 1\n\ndef fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):\n    period = pisano_period(k)\n    full_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    fib_mod = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, period):\n        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)\n    \n    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k\n    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k\n    \n    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    Q = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers modulo K for each query by leveraging the periodic nature of the Fibonacci sequence under modulo operations."

This method leverages the properties of Fibonacci numbers and uses a divide-and-conquer approach to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution makes extensive use of modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. This is crucial given the constraints of the problem.\n\n3. **Mathematical Insight**: The function `ans` in the official solution uses a mathematical formula to compute the result directly, avoiding the need to iterate over all Fibonacci numbers up to \\( N \\). This is a significant optimization over my initial approach, which attempted to compute each Fibonacci number individually.\n\n4. **Inverse Modulo**: The use of the `inv` function to compute the modular inverse is a clever way to handle division in modular arithmetic, which is necessary for the formula used in `ans`.\n\n#### Lessons Learned:\n\n- **Recursive Fibonacci Calculation**: The recursive approach to calculating Fibonacci numbers using properties of the sequence is more efficient than matrix exponentiation for this problem, especially when combined with memoization or direct computation of required terms.\n\n- **Direct Formula Application**: Understanding and applying mathematical formulas can significantly reduce computational complexity, as seen in the `ans` function, which directly computes the result using properties of powers and Fibonacci numbers.\n\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: Mastery of modular arithmetic, including techniques like modular inversion, is essential for handling large numbers in competitive programming.\n\nOverall, the official solution is insightful in its use of mathematical properties and efficient computation techniques, providing a more optimal solution to the problem."

For each test case, it calculates the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers modulo 10^9 + 7. It then raises this sum to the power of K, again taking the result modulo 10^9 + 7. The function stores the results for each test case and outputs them to standard output, each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to efficiently compute large powers of sums of Fibonacci numbers, especially under modular arithmetic constraints. This is common in competitive programming and cryptographic applications where performance and efficiency are critical due to large input sizes. The use of matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers and fast exponentiation for modular arithmetic are both techniques that can be applied to a wide range of problems involving sequences and modular calculations. Understanding these techniques can help in optimizing algorithms that deal with large numbers and require quick computations, such as in simulations, financial calculations, or any domain where Fibonacci-like sequences appear."
