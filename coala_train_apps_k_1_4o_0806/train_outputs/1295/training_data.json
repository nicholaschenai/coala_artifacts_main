    "summary": "In tackling the problem of computing the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to a power for large \\( N \\) and \\( K \\), the core concept was efficiently handling large computations using matrix exponentiation and modular arithmetic. The Fibonacci sequence can be computed in \\( O(\\log N) \\) time using matrix exponentiation, which is crucial for handling large values of \\( N \\).\n\nInitially, the solution failed because the function `solve()` was not called, leading to no execution of the input/output logic. This was a simple oversight but highlighted the importance of ensuring that the main function is executed in competitive programming setups.\n\nThe main challenge was efficiently computing the sum of Fibonacci numbers and their powers under a modulo. Direct computation was infeasible due to the size constraints, so using fast exponentiation to compute powers and modular arithmetic to manage large numbers was essential.\n\nThe final solution involved:\n- Using matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently.\n- Using fast exponentiation to compute large powers under a modulo.\n- Ensuring the function is called to handle input and output correctly.\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of efficient algorithms for handling large inputs and the necessity of careful attention to execution flow in competitive programming environments.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem of computing the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to a power for large \\( N \\) and \\( K \\) is challenging due to the constraints. The official solution provides a more efficient approach than my initial attempt, particularly in handling large values of \\( N \\) and \\( K \\).\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Efficient Fibonacci Calculation**: The official solution uses a recursive method `_fib` to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. This method leverages the properties of Fibonacci numbers and uses a divide-and-conquer approach to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution makes extensive use of modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. This is crucial given the constraints of the problem.\n\n3. **Mathematical Insight**: The function `ans` in the official solution uses a mathematical formula to compute the result directly, avoiding the need to iterate over all Fibonacci numbers up to \\( N \\). This is a significant optimization over my initial approach, which attempted to compute each Fibonacci number individually.\n\n4. **Inverse Modulo**: The use of the `inv` function to compute the modular inverse is a clever way to handle division in modular arithmetic, which is necessary for the formula used in `ans`.\n\n#### Lessons Learned:\n\n- **Recursive Fibonacci Calculation**: The recursive approach to calculating Fibonacci numbers using properties of the sequence is more efficient than matrix exponentiation for this problem, especially when combined with memoization or direct computation of required terms.\n\n- **Direct Formula Application**: Understanding and applying mathematical formulas can significantly reduce computational complexity, as seen in the `ans` function, which directly computes the result using properties of powers and Fibonacci numbers.\n\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: Mastery of modular arithmetic, including techniques like modular inversion, is essential for handling large numbers in competitive programming.\n\nOverall, the official solution is insightful in its use of mathematical properties and efficient computation techniques, providing a more optimal solution to the problem.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases, each specifying two integers, N and K. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers modulo 10^9 + 7. It then raises this sum to the power of K, again taking the result modulo 10^9 + 7. The function stores the results for each test case and outputs them to standard output, each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to efficiently compute large powers of sums of Fibonacci numbers, especially under modular arithmetic constraints. This is common in competitive programming and cryptographic applications where performance and efficiency are critical due to large input sizes. The use of matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers and fast exponentiation for modular arithmetic are both techniques that can be applied to a wide range of problems involving sequences and modular calculations. Understanding these techniques can help in optimizing algorithms that deal with large numbers and require quick computations, such as in simulations, financial calculations, or any domain where Fibonacci-like sequences appear."
