The depth is the number of runs, you have to do.\n- In every run you have to switch the direction. First run from left, next run from right. Next left...\nEvery run has these rules:\n- You start at the first number (from the direction).\n- Take for every number x the remainder of the division by the number of still available elements (from \n  this position!) to have the number for the next decision.\n- If the remainder-value is smaller than 3, take this number x (NOT the remainder-Value) direct\n  for the new array and continue with the next number.\n- If the remainder-value (e.g. 3) is greater than 2, take the next remainder-value-number (e.g. 3)\n  elements/numbers (inclusive the number x, NOT the remainder-value) as a sub-array in the new array.\n  Continue with the next number/element AFTER this taken elements/numbers.\n- Every sub-array in the array is independent and is only one element for the progress on the array. \n  For every sub-array you have to follow the same rules for unflatten it.\n  The direction is always the same as the actual run.\n```\n\nSounds complicated?

The first number is 4. The number is smaller than the number of remaining elements, so it is the remainder-value (4 / 5 -> remainder 4).\n   So 4 numbers (4, 5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the new array.\n2. The next number is 1. It is smaller than 3, so the 1 is added direct to the new array.\nNow we have --> [[4, 5, 1, 7], 1]\n\nSecond run: (start from right side!)\n1. The last number (first from other side) is 1. So the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n2. The next element is the sub-array. So we use the rules for this.\n2a.The last number is 7. There are 4 elements in the array. So for the next decision you have to\n   take the remainder from 7 / 4 -> 3. So 3 numbers (5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the \n   new array.\n2b.Now there is the 4 and only one element last in this array. 4 / 1 -> remainder 0. It is smaller\n   than 3. So the 4 is added direct to the new array.\nNow we have --> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n```\n\nThe given array will always contain numbers.

The unflattening process involves multiple runs, where each run alternates direction (left-to-right, then right-to-left, and so on). During each run, we decide whether to take a number as is or to create a sub-array based on the remainder of the division of the number by the count of remaining elements. This process is repeated for the specified depth.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize the Process**: Start with the given list and depth. The depth indicates how many times we need to process the list.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Depth**: For each depth level, alternate the direction of processing (left-to-right or right-to-left).\n\n3. **Process the List**:\n   - For each number in the list, calculate the remainder of the division of the number by the count of remaining elements.\n   - If the remainder is less than 3, add the number directly to the new list.\n   - If the remainder is 3 or more, create a sub-array with the number of elements equal to the remainder, starting from the current position, and add this sub-array to the new list.\n   - If a sub-array is encountered, process it recursively with the same rules.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: After processing for the given depth, return the final unflattened list.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n    for each level in depth:\n        if level is even:\n            process from left to right\n        else:\n            process from right to left\n        \n        initialize new_array as empty\n        while there are elements in flat_array:\n            calculate remainder = current_element % number_of_remaining_elements\n            if remainder < 3:\n                add current_element to new_array\n            else:\n                create sub_array with remainder elements\n                add sub_array to new_array\n                skip remainder elements in flat_array\n            if an element is a sub-array:\n                recursively unflatten the sub-array with depth - 1\n        set flat_array to new_array\n    return flat_array\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n    def process_array(array, direction):\n        new_array = []\n        i = 0\n        n = len(array)\n        \n        while i < n:\n            current_element = array[i]\n            remainder = current_element % (n - i)\n            \n            if remainder < 3:\n                new_array.append(current_element)\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                sub_array = array[i:i + remainder]\n                new_array.append(sub_array)\n                i += remainder\n        \n        return new_array\n    \n    for level in range(depth):\n        if level % 2 == 0:\n            # Process from left to right\n            flat_array = process_array(flat_array, 'left')\n        else:\n            # Process from right to left\n            flat_array = process_array(flat_array[::-1], 'right')[::-1]\n    \n    return flat_array\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **process_array**: This helper function processes the array in the specified direction. It calculates the remainder for each element and decides whether to add the element directly or create a sub-array.\n- **Main Loop**: The main loop iterates over the depth, alternating the direction of processing. It updates the `flat_array` with the result of each processing step.\n- **Direction Handling**: The direction is handled by reversing the array when necessary and reversing the result back to maintain the correct order."

The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.\n\n    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.\n\n    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\n    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:\n    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.\n    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.\n    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:\n    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.\n    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.\n    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.\n    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n            subarray_sums = []\n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n            subarray_sums.sort()\n            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])\n            return result % (10**9 + 7)\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic.

The challenge involved alternating the direction of processing (left-to-right and right-to-left) and correctly managing indices for slicing subarrays.\n\n### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n- **Alternating Directions**: The problem required processing the list in alternating directions for each depth level, which added complexity to index management.\n- **Recursive Subarray Processing**: Each subarray needed to be processed independently, following the same rules, which required careful handling of recursive calls.\n\n### Strategies and Challenges:\n- **Direction Handling**: Initially, the direction handling was incorrect, especially for the 'right' direction. The indices for slicing subarrays were not properly managed, leading to incorrect results.\n- **Index Management**: Ensuring indices were within bounds and correctly calculated for both directions was crucial. This was a common source of errors, leading to runtime errors or incorrect outputs.\n\n### Lessons Learned:\n- **Debugging Recursive Functions**: Recursive functions can be tricky, especially when they involve complex index calculations. Adding print statements or checks can help trace the flow and identify where things go wrong.\n- **Handling Edge Cases**: It's important to consider edge cases, such as when the remainder is exactly the number of remaining elements, to avoid out-of-bounds errors.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of careful index management and recursive function handling, especially in problems involving nested structures and alternating processing directions."

This is a concise way to manage the alternating direction and depth levels, which was a challenge in my initial attempts.\n\n2. **Direction Handling**: The official solution effectively uses list slicing and indexing to handle both left-to-right and right-to-left processing. The use of `[0, 1][c&1]` to toggle between directions based on the current depth (`c`) is a clever way to manage direction without explicit conditionals.\n\n3. **Subarray Processing**: The `parse` function in the official solution handles subarray processing by checking if the current element is a list and recursively parsing it. This ensures that nested structures are correctly processed at each depth level.\n\n4. **Index Management**: The use of list slicing and the ternary operator to decide whether to create a subarray or add an element directly is efficient. The solution uses `mod` to determine the size of the subarray and adjusts the index accordingly, which was a point of failure in my attempts.\n\n5. **Conciseness and Efficiency**: The official solution is more concise and efficient, using Python's list slicing and indexing capabilities to handle complex operations in fewer lines of code. This highlights the importance of leveraging Python's built-in features for more elegant solutions.\n\nOverall, the official solution provides a more robust and efficient approach to solving the problem, particularly in handling direction changes and recursive subarray processing. This experience underscores the value of concise code and the effective use of Python's capabilities in solving complex problems."
