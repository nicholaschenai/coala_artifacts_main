We need to determine the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the sequence of integers found along the shortest path from Vertex 1 to each other vertex `k` in the tree. The tree is defined by `N-1` edges connecting the vertices.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list. This will allow us to easily traverse the tree and find paths between vertices.\n\n2. **Path Finding**: Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from Vertex 1 to find the shortest path to each vertex `k`. Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path is unique and can be found using BFS.\n\n3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: For each path found from Vertex 1 to `k`, compute the LIS of the sequence of integers on that path. This can be efficiently done using a dynamic programming approach with binary search, which runs in `O(L log L)` time, where `L` is the length of the path.\n\n4. **Output**: For each vertex `k`, output the length of the LIS of the path from Vertex 1 to `k`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1.

        "content": "In this problem, we were tasked with finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for paths in a tree from a root vertex to every other vertex. The core concepts involved include tree traversal, pathfinding in trees, and efficient LIS calculation using dynamic programming with binary search.\n\n### Key Concepts and Strategies\n\n1. **Tree Representation**: The tree was represented using an adjacency list, which is efficient for traversal operations like DFS or BFS. This representation is crucial for efficiently finding paths in a tree structure.\n\n2. **Pathfinding in Trees**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path from the root to any vertex is unique. We used Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and maintain the path from the root to each vertex.\n\n3. **LIS Calculation**: The LIS was calculated using a dynamic programming approach with binary search, which is efficient with a time complexity of `O(L log L)`, where `L` is the length of the sequence. This method involves maintaining a list that stores the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences of different lengths.\n\n### Challenges and Solutions\n\n- **Input Handling**: Initially, the code did not execute because the `main()` function was not called. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by explicitly calling `main()` at the end of the script.\n\n- **Output Format**: Ensuring the output was printed correctly, with each LIS length on a new line, was crucial for passing the tests.\n\n### Code Snippet\n\nHere's the core function for calculating the LIS, which was central to solving the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_lis(sequence):\n    if not sequence:\n        return 0\n    \n    lis = []\n    for value in sequence:\n        low, high = 0, len(lis)\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if lis[mid] < value:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        if low == len(lis):\n            lis.append(value)\n        else:\n            lis[low] = value\n    \n    return len(lis)\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of efficient data structures and algorithms for pathfinding and subsequence problems, especially in large datasets."

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Process\n\nThe problem involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for paths in a tree, which is a non-trivial task due to the constraints and the need for efficient computation. Here are some insights and reflections based on the official solution and my approach:\n\n1. **Tree Traversal and Path Construction**:\n   - Both my solution and the official solution use a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree. This is a natural choice for tree problems as it allows us to explore each path from the root to other nodes efficiently.\n\n2. **Efficient LIS Calculation**:\n   - The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach with binary search (via the `bisect` module) to maintain and update the LIS efficiently. This is crucial given the constraints, as it allows the LIS to be computed in `O(N log N)` time complexity.\n   - My approach also used a similar method for calculating the LIS, but the official solution's use of a global `dp` array and a `changes` stack to track modifications is a clever way to handle backtracking during DFS.\n\n3. **Handling Backtracking**:\n   - The official solution uses a stack (`changes`) to remember the state of the `dp` array before each recursive call. This allows it to backtrack correctly after exploring each subtree, ensuring that the LIS calculation remains accurate as the DFS unwinds.\n   - This approach is more elegant and efficient than recalculating the LIS from scratch for each path, which was a potential inefficiency in my initial approach.\n\n4. **Global State Management**:\n   - The use of global variables like `dp`, `checked`, and `changes` in the official solution simplifies the management of state across recursive calls. This is particularly useful in recursive algorithms where maintaining state across different levels of recursion can be challenging.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Binary Search for LIS**: Using binary search to maintain the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences is a powerful technique for efficiently calculating the LIS.\n- **State Management in DFS**: Managing state changes with a stack during DFS allows for efficient backtracking, which is crucial in problems involving path-dependent calculations.\n- **Global Variables in Recursive Algorithms**: While often discouraged, the use of global variables can simplify complex recursive algorithms by reducing the need to pass and return multiple parameters.\n\nThese insights highlight the importance of efficient data structures and state management in solving complex algorithmic problems, especially under tight constraints."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data to construct a tree with `N` nodes, where each node has an associated value. It then builds an adjacency list to represent the tree structure based on the given edges. The function initializes a list to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for each node. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree, calculating the LIS for the path from the root to each node using the node values. Finally, it prints the LIS length for each node in the tree.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in a path within a tree structure. This is particularly relevant in computational problems involving trees, such as network routing, hierarchical data analysis, or any domain where data is structured in a tree and you need to analyze paths between nodes. The solution involves using depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and dynamic programming with binary search to efficiently compute the LIS for paths from a root node to other nodes. This approach is efficient for large trees, given the constraints, and can be adapted to similar problems where path-based subsequence analysis is required."
