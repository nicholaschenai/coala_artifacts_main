    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the smallest substring in a given string `S` that contains all the characters of another string `T`. If no such substring exists, we return an empty string. The solution should be efficient, ideally with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain two pointers to represent the current window in `S` and use a dictionary to count the characters in `T` that we need to include in the window. As we expand the window by moving the right pointer, we will check if the current window contains all characters of `T`. Once it does, we will try to shrink the window from the left to find the minimum window that still contains all characters of `T`. We will keep track of the minimum window found during this process.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a dictionary to count characters in T\n   Initialize a dictionary to count characters in the current window\n   Initialize two pointers, left and right, to 0\n   Initialize variables to track the minimum window size and its start position\n   Initialize a variable to count how many characters from T are currently satisfied in the window\n\n   While the right pointer is less than the length of S:\n       Add the character at the right pointer to the window count\n       If this character is needed and the count in the window matches the count in T, increment the satisfied count\n\n       While the satisfied count equals the number of unique characters in T:\n           Update the minimum window size and start position if the current window is smaller\n           Remove the character at the left pointer from the window count\n           If this character is needed and the count in the window is less than the count in T, decrement the satisfied count\n           Move the left pointer to the right\n\n       Move the right pointer to the right\n\n   If a minimum window was found, return the substring from the start position with the minimum size\n   Otherwise, return an empty string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        if not t or not s:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        # Dictionary to count characters in T\n        dict_t = {}\n        for char in t:\n            dict_t[char] = dict_t.get(char, 0) + 1\n        \n        # Number of unique characters in T that need to be present in the window\n        required = len(dict_t)\n        \n        # Left and right pointers\n        l, r = 0, 0\n        \n        # Formed is the number of unique characters in the current window that match the required count in T\n        formed = 0\n        \n        # Dictionary to count characters in the current window\n        window_counts = {}\n        \n        # (window length, left, right)\n        ans = float(\"inf\"), None, None\n        \n        while r < len(s):\n            # Add one character from the right to the window\n            character = s[r]\n            window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1\n            \n            # If the current character's count matches the count in T, increment formed\n            if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] == dict_t[character]:\n                formed += 1\n            \n            # Try to contract the window until it ceases to be 'desirable'\n            while l <= r and formed == required:\n                character = s[l]\n                \n                # Save the smallest window until now\n                if r - l + 1 < ans[0]:\n                    ans = (r - l + 1, l, r)\n                \n                # The character at the position pointed by the `left` pointer is no longer a part of the window\n                window_counts[character] -= 1\n                if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] < dict_t[character]:\n                    formed -= 1\n                \n                # Move the left pointer ahead\n                l += 1\n            \n            # Keep expanding the window\n            r += 1\n        \n        # Return the smallest window or an empty string if no window was found\n        return \"\" if ans[0] == float(\"inf\") else s[ans[1]:ans[2] + 1]\n```\n\nThis solution uses a sliding window approach with two pointers and a dictionary to efficiently find the minimum window containing all characters of `T` in `S`.",
