    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe have an infinite binary tree where each node is labeled with an integer. The root node is labeled `1`, and for any node labeled `v`, its left child is `2 * v` and its right child is `2 * v + 1`. We are given a series of queries, each with three integers `n`, `u`, and `v`. For each query, we need to count the number of pairs `(w, t)` such that the path configuration from `w` to `t` is the same as the path configuration from `u` to `v`, where `1 <= w, t <= n`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Path Configuration**: The path from any node `w` to `t` in this tree can be uniquely determined by the sequence of moves (left, right, parent as left child, parent as right child) needed to traverse from `w` to `t`.\n\n2. **Common Ancestor**: The path from `u` to `v` can be broken down into two parts: from `u` to their lowest common ancestor (LCA) and from the LCA to `v`.\n\n3. **Path Matching**: For a pair `(w, t)` to have the same path configuration as `(u, v)`, the path from `w` to `t` must follow the same sequence of moves as from `u` to `v`.\n\n4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: For each query, we need to determine how many such pairs `(w, t)` exist within the range `[1, n]`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `find_lca(x, y)` to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes `x` and `y`.\n2. For each query `(n, u, v)`:\n   - Find the LCA of `u` and `v`.\n   - Determine the path configuration from `u` to `v` using the LCA.\n   - Count all pairs `(w, t)` such that the path from `w` to `t` matches the path from `u` to `v`.\n3. Output the count for each query.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_lca(x, y):\n    # Find the lowest common ancestor of x and y\n    while x != y:\n        if x > y:\n            x //= 2\n        else:\n            y //= 2\n    return x\n\ndef path_length(x, lca):\n    # Calculate the number of steps from x to lca\n    length = 0\n    while x != lca:\n        x //= 2\n        length += 1\n    return length\n\ndef count_pairs(n, u, v):\n    # Find the LCA of u and v\n    lca = find_lca(u, v)\n    \n    # Calculate the path lengths from u to lca and from v to lca\n    path_u_to_lca = path_length(u, lca)\n    path_v_to_lca = path_length(v, lca)\n    \n    # Total path length from u to v\n    total_path_length = path_u_to_lca + path_v_to_lca\n    \n    # Count pairs (w, t) with the same path configuration\n    count = 0\n    for w in range(1, n + 1):\n        for t in range(1, n + 1):\n            if w == t:\n                continue\n            lca_wt = find_lca(w, t)\n            if path_length(w, lca_wt) + path_length(t, lca_wt) == total_path_length:\n                count += 1\n    \n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    Q = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        u = int(data[index + 1])\n        v = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        result = count_pairs(n, u, v)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **find_lca**: This function finds the lowest common ancestor of two nodes by moving both nodes up the tree until they meet.\n- **path_length**: This function calculates the number of steps from a node to its ancestor.\n- **count_pairs**: This function counts the number of pairs `(w, t)` that have the same path configuration as `(u, v)`.\n- **main**: This function reads input, processes each query, and outputs the results.",
