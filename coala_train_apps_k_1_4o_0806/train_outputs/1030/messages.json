The root node is labeled `1`, and for any node labeled `v`, its left child is `2 * v` and its right child is `2 * v + 1`. We are given a series of queries, each with three integers `n`, `u`, and `v`. For each query, we need to count the number of pairs `(w, t)` such that the path configuration from `w` to `t` is the same as the path configuration from `u` to `v`, where `1 <= w, t <= n`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Path Configuration**: The path configuration from a node `u` to a node `v` is the unique sequence of moves (left, right, parent as left child, parent as right child) that transforms `u` into `v`.\n\n2. **Determine Path Configuration**: For each query, determine the path configuration from `u` to `v`. This involves:\n   - Moving up the tree from `u` and `v` until they meet at a common ancestor.\n   - Record the sequence of moves required to reach this common ancestor from both `u` and `v`.\n\n3. **Count Matching Pairs**: For each pair `(w, t)` where `1 <= w, t <= n`, check if the path configuration from `w` to `t` matches the path configuration from `u` to `v`. Count such pairs.\n\n4. **Efficiency Consideration**: Given the constraints, directly checking all pairs `(w, t)` is inefficient.

        "content": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Binary Tree Path Configuration Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem revolves around understanding the structure of an infinite binary tree where each node is labeled with an integer. The key operations involve moving between nodes using specific rules, and the task is to determine the number of node pairs `(w, t)` that share the same path configuration as a given pair `(u, v)`. The core concept is to leverage the properties of binary trees, particularly the notion of the lowest common ancestor (LCA), to determine path configurations efficiently.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\nInitially, the approach involved iterating over all possible pairs `(w, t)` within the range `[1, n]` to count those with the same path configuration as `(u, v)`. This brute-force method was inefficient and incorrect, especially given the constraints where `n` can be as large as `10^9`. The challenge was to find a more efficient way to determine and count valid path configurations without explicitly checking every possible pair.\n\n#### Correct Approach\nThe correct approach involves:\n1. **Finding the LCA**: For nodes `u` and `v`, compute their lowest common ancestor. This helps in breaking down the path from `u` to `v` into two segments: from `u` to the LCA and from the LCA to `v`.\n2. **Path Length Calculation**: Determine the number of steps from each node to the LCA, which helps in understanding the path configuration.\n3. **Efficient Counting**: Instead of iterating over all pairs, use the properties of the binary tree to count the number of pairs `(w, t)` that have the same path configuration. This involves understanding the binary representation and structure of the tree.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\nThe main lesson from this problem is the importance of understanding the underlying structure and properties of data structures like binary trees. Efficient solutions often require leveraging these properties rather than relying on brute-force methods. Additionally, the problem highlighted the need to carefully consider constraints and optimize the approach accordingly."

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: The official solution leverages the binary representation of the node labels to determine the path configuration. This is a crucial insight because the path in a binary tree can be directly related to the binary representation of the node indices.\n\n2. **Common Prefix**: The solution identifies the longest common prefix of the binary representations of `u` and `v`. This common prefix represents the path to their lowest common ancestor (LCA).\n\n3. **Path Configuration**: After finding the common prefix, the remaining parts of the binary strings represent the path from the LCA to `u` and `v`. The solution then constructs potential paths for other nodes `(w, t)` by considering nodes with the same prefix.\n\n4. **Efficient Counting**: Instead of iterating over all possible pairs `(w, t)`, the solution efficiently counts the number of valid pairs by considering the binary structure and constraints.\n\n#### Why My Approach Failed\n\n- **Inefficient Pair Counting**: My initial approach attempted to iterate over all possible pairs `(w, t)`, which is computationally expensive and infeasible for large `n`. This led to incorrect results and inefficiency.\n\n- **Lack of Binary Insight**: I did not utilize the binary representation of node labels, which is a powerful tool for understanding the structure of the tree and the path configurations.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Binary Representation in Trees**: Understanding how binary representations relate to tree structures can significantly simplify problems involving binary trees.\n\n- **Common Prefix for LCA**: Using the common prefix of binary representations to find the LCA is an efficient technique that can be applied to similar problems.\n\n- **Efficient Counting Techniques**: Instead of brute force, leveraging properties of the problem (like binary structure) can lead to more efficient solutions.\n\nThis problem highlighted the importance of considering alternative representations (like binary) and efficient counting strategies in algorithm design."
