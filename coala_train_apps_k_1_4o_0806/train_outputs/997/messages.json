This problem can be extended to allow to **update individual array elements**. If an element $a[i]$ changes, it's sufficient to update the value of $b[k]$ for the block to which this element belongs ($k = i / s$) in one operation:\n\n    $$ b[k] += a_{new}[i] - a_{old}[i] $$\n\n    On the other hand, the task of finding the sum of elements can be replaced with the task of finding minimal/maximal element of a subarray. If this problem has to address individual elements' updates as well, updating the value of $b[k]$ is also possible, but it will require iterating through all values of block $k$ in $O(s) = O(\\sqrt{n})$ operations.\n\n    Sqrt decomposition can be applied in a similar way to a whole class of other problems: finding the number of zero elements, finding the first non-zero element, counting elements which satisfy a certain property etc.\n\n    Another class of problems appears when we need to **update array elements on intervals**: increment existing elements or replace them with a given value.\n\n    For example, let's say we can do two types of operations on an array: add a given value $\\delta$ to all array elements on interval $[l, r]$ or query the value of element $a[i]$. Let's store the value which has to be added to all elements of block $k$ in $b[k]$ (initially all $b[k] = 0$). During each \"add\" operation we need to add $\\delta$ to $b[k]$ for all blocks which belong to interval $[l, r]$ and to add $\\delta$ to $a[i]$ for all elements which belong to the \"tails\" of the interval. The answer a query $i$ is simply $a[i] + b[i/s]$. This way \"add\" operation has $O(\\sqrt{n})$ complexity, and answering a query has $O(1)$ complexity.\n\n    Finally, those two classes of problems can be combined if the task requires doing **both** element updates on an interval and queries on an interval. Both operations can be done with $O(\\sqrt{n})$ complexity. This will require two block arrays $b$ and $c$: one to keep track of element updates and another to keep track of answers to the query.\n\n    There exist other problems which can be solved using sqrt decomposition, for example, a problem about maintaining a set of numbers which would allow adding/deleting numbers, checking whether a number belongs to the set and finding $k$-th largest number. To solve it one has to store numbers in increasing order, split into several blocks with $\\sqrt{n}$ numbers in each. Every time a number is added/deleted, the blocks have to be rebalanced by moving numbers between beginnings and ends of adjacent blocks.\n\n    ## Mo's algorithm\n\n    A similar idea, based on sqrt decomposition, can be used to answer range queries ($Q$) offline in $O((N+Q)\\sqrt{N})$.\n    This might sound like a lot worse than the methods in the previous section, since this is a slightly worse complexity than we had earlier and cannot update values between two queries.\n    But in a lot of situations this method has advantages.\n    During a normal sqrt decomposition, we have to precompute the answers for each block, and merge them during answering queries.\n    In some problems this merging step can be quite problematic.\n    E.g. when each queries asks to find the **mode** of its range (the number that appears the most often).\n    For this each block would have to store the count of each number in it in some sort of data structure, and we cannot longer perform the merge step fast enough any more.\n    **Mo's algorithm** uses a completely different approach, that can answer these kind of queries fast, because it only keeps track of one data structure, and the only operations with it are easy and fast.\n\n    The idea is to answer the queries in a special order based on the indices.\n    We will first answer all queries which have the left index in block 0, then answer all queries which have left index in block 1 and so on.\n    And also we will have to answer the queries of a block is a special order, namely sorted by the right index of the queries.\n\n    As already said we will use a single data structure.\n    This data structure will store information about the range.\n    At the beginning this range will be empty.\n    When we want to answer the next query (in the special order), we simply extend or reduce the range, by adding/removing elements on both sides of the current range, until we transformed it into the query range.\n    This way, we only need to add or remove a single element once at a time, which should be pretty easy operations in our data structure.\n\n    Since we change the order of answering the queries, this is only possible when we are allowed to answer the queries in offline mode.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    In Mo's algorithm we use two functions for adding an index and for removing an index from the range which we are currently maintaining.\n\n    ```cpp\n    void remove(idx);  // TODO: remove value at idx from data structure\n    void add(idx);     // TODO: add value at idx from data structure\n    int get_answer();  // TODO: extract the current answer of the data structure\n\n    int block_size;\n\n    struct Query {\n        int l, r, idx;\n        bool operator<(Query other) const\n        {\n            return make_pair(l / block_size, r) <\n                   make_pair(other.l / block_size, other.r);\n        }\n    };\n\n    vector<int> mo_s_algorithm(vector<Query> queries) {\n        vector<int> answers(queries.size());\n        sort(queries.begin(), queries.end());\n\n        // TODO: initialize data structure\n\n        int cur_l = 0;\n        int cur_r = -1;\n        // invariant: data structure will always reflect the range [cur_l, cur_r]\n        for (Query q : queries) {\n            while (cur_l > q.l) {\n                cur_l--;\n                add(cur_l);\n            }\n            while (cur_r < q.r) {\n                cur_r++;\n                add(cur_r);\n            }\n            while (cur_l < q.l) {\n                remove(cur_l);\n                cur_l++;\n            }\n            while (cur_r > q.r) {\n                remove(cur_r);\n                cur_r--;\n            }\n            answers[q.idx] = get_answer();\n        }\n        return answers;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe issue seems to be related to the way the input is being handled and possibly the function calls. Let's break down the potential issues:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which reads all input at once. This is correct for competitive programming environments, but we need to ensure that the input is being parsed correctly.\n\n2. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script that reads from standard input, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.\n\n3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This is correct, but we need to ensure that the `print` statements are executed.\n\n### Steps to Correct the Code\n\n1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.\n\n2. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check that the input parsing logic correctly handles the input format and converts indices to zero-based correctly.\n\n3. **Output the Results**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.\n\n### Revised Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n    # Initialize scores for each student\n    scores = [10] * N\n    \n    # Process each question\n    for i, j, k in questions:\n        for student in range(i, j + 1):\n            scores[student] *= k\n    \n    # Calculate the mean of the scores\n    total_score = sum(scores)\n    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division\n    \n    return mean_score\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        M = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        questions = []\n        for _ in range(M):\n            i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index\n            j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index\n            k = int(data[index + 2])\n            index += 3\n            questions.append((i, j, k))\n        \n        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Function Call**: Added a call to `main()` at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.\n- **Input Parsing**: Ensured that the input is parsed correctly and indices are converted to zero-based.\n- **Output**: The results are printed after processing all test cases, ensuring the output is as expected."

Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the \"Crime and Punishment\" problem above.\n\n        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.\n\n        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:\n\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # hull of lattice (x, y) such that C*y <= A*x+B\n            def hull(A, B, C, N):\n                def diff(x, y):\n                    return C*y-A*x\n                a = fraction(A, C)\n                p, q = convergents(a)\n                ah = []\n                ph = [B // C]\n                qh = [0]\n\n                def insert(dq, dp):\n                    k = (N - qh[-1]) // dq\n                    if diff(dq, dp) > 0:\n                        k = min(k, (B - diff(qh[-1], ph[-1])) // diff(dq, dp))\n                    ah.append(k)\n                    qh.append(qh[-1] + k*dq)\n                    ph.append(ph[-1] + k*dp)\n\n                for i in range(1, len(q) - 1):\n                    if i % 2 == 0:\n                        while diff(qh[-1] + q[i+1], ph[-1] + p[i+1]) <= B:\n                            t = (B - diff(qh[-1] + q[i+1], ph[-1] + p[i+1])) // abs(diff(q[i], p[i]))\n                            dp = p[i+1] - t*p[i]\n                            dq = q[i+1] - t*q[i]\n                            if dq < 0 or qh[-1] + dq > N:\n                                break\n                            insert(dq, dp)\n\n                insert(q[-1], p[-1])\n\n                for i in reversed(range(len(q))):\n                    if i % 2 == 1:\n                        while qh[-1] + q[i-1] <= N:\n                            t = (N - qh[-1] - q[i-1]) // q[i]\n                            dp = p[i-1] + t*p[i]\n                            dq = q[i-1] + t*q[i]\n                            insert(dq, dp)\n                return ah, ph, qh\n            ```\n\n    !!! example \"[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)\"\n        There is a rational number $\\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \\sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\\frac{p}{q}$.\n\n        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \\;\\bmod\\; M$ for $1 \\leq x \\leq N$.\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.\n\n        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \\equiv qr \\pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \\equiv p_2 q_1 \\pmod m$. Assuming that $\\frac{p_1}{q_1} \\neq \\frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.\n\n        In the statement we were told that $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.\n\n        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr \\;\\bmod\\; m \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \\bmod m$ for $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $\\frac{r}{m} q - k \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\\frac{r}{m}$.\n\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m \n            def mod_min(r, n, m):\n                a = fraction(r, m)\n                p, q = convergents(a)\n                for i in range(2, len(q)):\n                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):\n                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]\n                        return q[i-1] + t*q[i]\n            ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The task was to efficiently handle potentially large input sizes and compute the desired result.\n\n#### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Efficient Input Handling**: The official solution uses direct input reading and parsing, which is crucial for handling large input sizes efficiently. This is a common practice in competitive programming to avoid timeouts.\n\n2. **Use of Dictionary**: The official solution uses a dictionary to store scores only for students who have been affected by any question. This is a space-efficient approach compared to maintaining a list for all students, especially when many students might not be affected by any question.\n\n3. **Iterative Updates**: The solution iteratively updates the scores for each question, ensuring that only the relevant students' scores are modified. This avoids unnecessary computations.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The use of a try-except block in the official solution is a safeguard against unexpected input errors, although it might not be necessary in a controlled environment where input constraints are guaranteed.\n\n#### Lessons Learned:\n\n- **Space Optimization**: Using a dictionary to store only necessary data can save space and potentially improve performance, especially when dealing with sparse data.\n  \n- **Direct Input Parsing**: Reading and parsing input directly from standard input can be more efficient than using higher-level input functions, especially in competitive programming contexts.\n\n- **Iterative Processing**: Processing data iteratively and only updating necessary parts can lead to more efficient algorithms, both in terms of time and space.\n\nOverall, the official solution provided a more space-efficient approach by using a dictionary, which is a valuable technique when dealing with large datasets where not all elements need to be stored or processed."
