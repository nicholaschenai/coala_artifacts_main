INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Over a month, the teacher assigns several questions, each with a complexity factor. For each question, a range of students' scores is multiplied by the complexity factor. Our task is to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been applied, and output the floor of this mean for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Apply Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students in the specified range by the complexity factor.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.
4. **Output Result**: Output the floored mean for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for N students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        # Apply the complexity factor k to the scores from index i-1 to j-1
        for index from i-1 to j-1:
            scores[index] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T  # Number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read N, M  # Number of students and number of questions
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k  # Question details
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        # Process the test case and get the result
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        
        # Output the result
        print(result)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for N students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        # Apply the complexity factor k to the scores from index i-1 to j-1
        for index in range(i-1, j):
            scores[index] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index])
            j = int(data[index + 1])
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        # Process the test case and get the result
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        
        # Store the result
        results.append(result)
    
    # Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input data, processes each test case by updating student scores based on the given questions, calculates the mean of the scores, and outputs the floored mean for each test case.

    ## Other problems

    So far we were discussing the problem of finding the sum of elements of a continuous subarray. This problem can be extended to allow to **update individual array elements**. If an element $a[i]$ changes, it's sufficient to update the value of $b[k]$ for the block to which this element belongs ($k = i / s$) in one operation:

    $$ b[k] += a_{new}[i] - a_{old}[i] $$

    On the other hand, the task of finding the sum of elements can be replaced with the task of finding minimal/maximal element of a subarray. If this problem has to address individual elements' updates as well, updating the value of $b[k]$ is also possible, but it will require iterating through all values of block $k$ in $O(s) = O(\sqrt{n})$ operations.

    Sqrt decomposition can be applied in a similar way to a whole class of other problems: finding the number of zero elements, finding the first non-zero element, counting elements which satisfy a certain property etc.

    Another class of problems appears when we need to **update array elements on intervals**: increment existing elements or replace them with a given value.

    For example, let's say we can do two types of operations on an array: add a given value $\delta$ to all array elements on interval $[l, r]$ or query the value of element $a[i]$. Let's store the value which has to be added to all elements of block $k$ in $b[k]$ (initially all $b[k] = 0$). During each "add" operation we need to add $\delta$ to $b[k]$ for all blocks which belong to interval $[l, r]$ and to add $\delta$ to $a[i]$ for all elements which belong to the "tails" of the interval. The answer a query $i$ is simply $a[i] + b[i/s]$. This way "add" operation has $O(\sqrt{n})$ complexity, and answering a query has $O(1)$ complexity.

    Finally, those two classes of problems can be combined if the task requires doing **both** element updates on an interval and queries on an interval. Both operations can be done with $O(\sqrt{n})$ complexity. This will require two block arrays $b$ and $c$: one to keep track of element updates and another to keep track of answers to the query.

    There exist other problems which can be solved using sqrt decomposition, for example, a problem about maintaining a set of numbers which would allow adding/deleting numbers, checking whether a number belongs to the set and finding $k$-th largest number. To solve it one has to store numbers in increasing order, split into several blocks with $\sqrt{n}$ numbers in each. Every time a number is added/deleted, the blocks have to be rebalanced by moving numbers between beginnings and ends of adjacent blocks.

    ## Mo's algorithm

    A similar idea, based on sqrt decomposition, can be used to answer range queries ($Q$) offline in $O((N+Q)\sqrt{N})$.
    This might sound like a lot worse than the methods in the previous section, since this is a slightly worse complexity than we had earlier and cannot update values between two queries.
    But in a lot of situations this method has advantages.
    During a normal sqrt decomposition, we have to precompute the answers for each block, and merge them during answering queries.
    In some problems this merging step can be quite problematic.
    E.g. when each queries asks to find the **mode** of its range (the number that appears the most often).
    For this each block would have to store the count of each number in it in some sort of data structure, and we cannot longer perform the merge step fast enough any more.
    **Mo's algorithm** uses a completely different approach, that can answer these kind of queries fast, because it only keeps track of one data structure, and the only operations with it are easy and fast.

    The idea is to answer the queries in a special order based on the indices.
    We will first answer all queries which have the left index in block 0, then answer all queries which have left index in block 1 and so on.
    And also we will have to answer the queries of a block is a special order, namely sorted by the right index of the queries.

    As already said we will use a single data structure.
    This data structure will store information about the range.
    At the beginning this range will be empty.
    When we want to answer the next query (in the special order), we simply extend or reduce the range, by adding/removing elements on both sides of the current range, until we transformed it into the query range.
    This way, we only need to add or remove a single element once at a time, which should be pretty easy operations in our data structure.

    Since we change the order of answering the queries, this is only possible when we are allowed to answer the queries in offline mode.

    ### Implementation

    In Mo's algorithm we use two functions for adding an index and for removing an index from the range which we are currently maintaining.

    ```cpp
    void remove(idx);  // TODO: remove value at idx from data structure
    void add(idx);     // TODO: add value at idx from data structure
    int get_answer();  // TODO: extract the current answer of the data structure

    int block_size;

    struct Query {
        int l, r, idx;
        bool operator<(Query other) const
        {
            return make_pair(l / block_size, r) <
                   make_pair(other.l / block_size, other.r);
        }
    };

    vector<int> mo_s_algorithm(vector<Query> queries) {
        vector<int> answers(queries.size());
        sort(queries.begin(), queries.end());

        // TODO: initialize data structure

        int cur_l = 0;
        int cur_r = -1;
        // invariant: data structure will always reflect the range [cur_l, cur_r]
        for (Query q : queries) {
            while (cur_l > q.l) {
                cur_l--;
                add(cur_l);
            }
            while (cur_r < q.r) {

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Throughout the month, the teacher assigns questions with a complexity factor to a range of students. When a student solves a question, their score is multiplied by the complexity factor. We need to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been assigned and solved. The result should be the floor value of this mean.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start with an array where each student has a score of 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students in the specified range by the complexity factor.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the floored mean score.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for student in range i to j:
            scores[student] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, M
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k
            questions.append((i-1, j-1, k))  # Convert to 0-based index
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for each student
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        for student in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[student] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

            k = int(data[index + 2])

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Initialization**: Each student starts with a score of 10.
- **Processing Questions**: For each question, we multiply the scores of students in the specified range by the complexity factor.
- **Mean Calculation**: After processing all questions, we calculate the total score and compute the mean using floor division.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints, and processed accordingly.

### Explanation of the Code

- **Initialization**: Each student starts with a score of 10.
- **Processing Questions**: For each question, we multiply the scores of students in the specified range by the complexity factor.
- **Mean Calculation**: After processing all questions, we calculate the total score and compute the mean using floor division.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints, and processed accordingly.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Throughout the month, the teacher assigns questions with a complexity factor to a range of students. When a student solves a question, their score is multiplied by the complexity factor. We need to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been assigned and solved. The result should be the floor value of this mean.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start with an array where each student has a score of 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students in the specified range by the complexity factor.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the floored mean score.

### Pseudocode

function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for student in range i to j:
            scores[student] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue seems to be related to the way the input is being handled and possibly the function calls. Let's break down the potential issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which reads all input at once. This is correct for competitive programming environments, but we need to ensure that the input is being parsed correctly.

2. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script that reads from standard input, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This is correct, but we need to ensure that the `print` statements are executed.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check that the input parsing logic correctly handles the input format and converts indices to zero-based correctly.

3. **Output the Results**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Revised Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for each student
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        for student in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[student] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
main()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `main()` at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
- **Input Parsing**: Ensured that the input is parsed correctly and indices are converted to zero-based.
- **Output**: The results are printed after processing all test cases, ensuring the output is as expected.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue seems to be related to the way the input is being handled and possibly the function calls. Let's break down the potential issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which reads all input at once. This is correct for competitive programming environments, but we need to ensure that the input is being parsed correctly.

2. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script that reads from standard input, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This is correct, but we need to ensure that the `print` statements are executed.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check that the input parsing logic correctly handles the input format and converts indices to zero-based correctly.

3. **Output the Results**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Revised Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for each student
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        for student in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[student] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
main()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `main()` at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
- **Input Parsing**: Ensured that the input is parsed correctly and indices are converted to zero-based.
- **Output**: The results are printed after processing all test cases, ensuring the output is as expected.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m 
            def mod_min(r, n, m):
                a = fraction(r, m)
                p, q = convergents(a)
                for i in range(2, len(q)):
                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):
                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]
                        return q[i-1] + t*q[i]

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Throughout the month, the teacher assigns questions with a complexity factor to a range of students. When a student solves a question, their score is multiplied by the complexity factor. We need to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been assigned and solved. The result should be the floor value of this mean.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start with an array where each student has a score of 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students in the specified range by the complexity factor.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the floored mean score.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for student in range i to j:
            scores[student] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, M
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k
            questions.append((i-1, j-1, k))  # Convert to 0-based index
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for each student
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        for student in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[student] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Initialization**: Each student starts with a score of 10.
- **Processing Questions**: For each question, we multiply the scores of students in the specified range by the complexity factor.
- **Mean Calculation**: After processing all questions, we calculate the total score and compute the mean using floor division.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints, and processed accordingly.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue seems to be related to the way the input is being handled and possibly the function calls. Let's break down the potential issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which reads all input at once. This is correct for competitive programming environments, but we need to ensure that the input is being parsed correctly.

2. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script that reads from standard input, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This is correct, but we need to ensure that the `print` statements are executed.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check that the input parsing logic correctly handles the input format and converts indices to zero-based correctly.

3. **Output the Results**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Revised Python Solution

def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for each student
    scores = [10] * N

            scores[student] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their scores are multiplied by the complexity factor for questions they solve.

### Key Concepts and Patterns:
- **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
- **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it correctly is crucial in competitive programming.
- **Zero-based Indexing**: Converting input indices to zero-based for easier array manipulation in Python.

### Strategies:
- **Efficient Input Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then parsing it was effective for handling large input sizes.
- **Iterative Updates**: Iterating over the specified range for each question and updating scores directly was straightforward and worked well within the constraints.

### Fixes and Learnings:
- **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is executed is a basic but crucial step.
- **Output Verification**: Ensuring that results are printed correctly after processing all test cases was necessary to match expected outputs.

This problem reinforced the importance of efficient input handling and careful index management in array-based problems. It also highlighted the need to ensure that the main logic is executed by calling the appropriate functions.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
- Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$
- $1 \leq k \leq 100$

-----Sample Output:-----
202

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Initial score of students will be : $[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$
after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 50, 50, 10, 10]$
after solving question 2 scores will be: $[50, 100, 100, 20, 20]$
after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 100, 700, 140, 20]$
Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will $(50+100+700+140+20)/5 = 202$

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Throughout the month, the teacher assigns questions with a complexity factor to a range of students. When a student solves a question, their score is multiplied by the complexity factor. We need to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been assigned and solved. The result should be the floor value of this mean.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start with an array where each student has a score of 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students in the specified range by the complexity factor.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the floored mean score.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for student in range i to j:
            scores[student] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, M
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k
            questions.append((i-1, j-1, k))  # Convert to 0-based index
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        print result
```

### Final Python Solution

def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for each student

    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem involved updating scores for a range of students based on the complexity of questions and then calculating the mean of these scores. The task was to efficiently handle potentially large input sizes and compute the desired result.

#### Key Insights:

1. **Efficient Input Handling**: The official solution uses direct input reading and parsing, which is crucial for handling large input sizes efficiently. This is a common practice in competitive programming to avoid timeouts.

2. **Use of Dictionary**: The official solution uses a dictionary to store scores only for students who have been affected by any question. This is a space-efficient approach compared to maintaining a list for all students, especially when many students might not be affected by any question.

3. **Iterative Updates**: The solution iteratively updates the scores for each question, ensuring that only the relevant students' scores are modified. This avoids unnecessary computations.

4. **Error Handling**: The use of a try-except block in the official solution is a safeguard against unexpected input errors, although it might not be necessary in a controlled environment where input constraints are guaranteed.

#### Lessons Learned:

- **Space Optimization**: Using a dictionary to store only necessary data can save space and potentially improve performance, especially when dealing with sparse data.
  
- **Direct Input Parsing**: Reading and parsing input directly from standard input can be more efficient than using higher-level input functions, especially in competitive programming contexts.

- **Iterative Processing**: Processing data iteratively and only updating necessary parts can lead to more efficient algorithms, both in terms of time and space.

Overall, the official solution provided a more space-efficient approach by using a dictionary, which is a valuable technique when dealing with large datasets where not all elements need to be stored or processed.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their scores are multiplied by the complexity factor for questions they solve.

For each test case, it reads the number of students and the number of questions, followed by the details of each question. It then processes each test case by calling another function to calculate the mean score of students after applying the effects of the questions. The results for each test case are collected and printed sequentially.

[Problem]
    Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
    At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
    This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
    Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
    - Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

    -----Output:-----
    For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
    - $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
    - $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$
    - $1 \leq k \leq 100$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask1 
    - 
    $1 \leq T \leq 10$
    - 
    $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^4$
    Subtask2
    - 
    Original Constraints 

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    5 3
    1 3 5
    2 5 2
    3 4 7

    -----Sample Output:-----
    202

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    Initial score of students will be : $[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$
    after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 50, 50, 10, 10]$
    after solving question 2 scores will be: $[50, 100, 100, 20, 20]$
    after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 100, 700, 140, 20]$
    Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will $(50+100+700+140+20)/5 = 202$
