Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \\leq i \\leq N$.    \nA Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.\nGiven these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.\n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$ respectively. \n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^2$\n- $1 \\le K \\le 10^9$ \n- $1 \\le D \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le A_i \\le 10^7$ for each valid $i$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (40 points):\n- $N = 1$\n- $1 \\le A_1 \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n5\n1 5 31\n4\n1 10 3\n23\n2 5 7\n20 36\n2 5 10\n19 2\n3 3 300\n1 1 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n0\n2\n7\n4\n1\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- \nExample case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.\n- \nExample case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.\n- \nExample case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nChef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan contests for the next `D` days, but he can host at most one contest per day. The task is to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host given these constraints.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.\n2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.\n3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.\n4. **Output the Result**: For each test case, output the maximum number of contests that can be hosted.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfor each test case:\n    read N, K, D\n    read the list of problems created by each setter\n    total_problems = sum of all problems\n    max_contests = total_problems // K\n    result = min(max_contests, D)\n    print result\n```\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_division_3_contests():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        D = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        problems = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        \n        total_problems = sum(problems)\n        max_contests = total_problems // K\n        results.append(min(max_contests, D))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, we extract the number of setters `N`, the number of problems needed per contest `K`, and the number of days `D`.\n- **Calculate Total Problems**: We sum up the problems from all setters.\n- **Determine Maximum Contests**: We calculate how many contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by `K`.\n- **Limit by Days**: We take the minimum of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days `D`.\n- **Output**: We store the result for each test case and print them at the end."

The function needs to be called to execute the logic.\n\n        4. **Logic and Computation**: The logic for computing the number of subsets seems correct based on the problem statement.

We need to parse this input correctly.\n\n3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and then printed, but the function is not called, so this step is never reached.\n\nTo fix these issues, we need to:\n\n- Read the input from standard input.\n- Parse the input into the required format.\n- Call the function with the parsed input.\n- Ensure the function prints the results directly.\n\nLet's correct the solution with these considerations:\n\n```python\ndef max_contests(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, D = test_case[0]\n        A = test_case[1]\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of problems available\n        total_problems = sum(A)\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed\n        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K\n        \n        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D\n        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(max_contests)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Read input from standard input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse the input\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K, D = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n    index += 3\n    A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n    index += N\n    test_cases.append(((N, K, D), A))\n\n# Call the function with the parsed input\nmax_contests(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n\n- **Input Reading**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings.\n- **Input Parsing**: We parse the number of test cases `T` and then iterate over each test case to extract `N`, `K`, `D`, and the list `A`.\n- **Function Call**: We call `max_contests` with the parsed input.\n- **Output**: The function prints the results directly for each test case. \n\nThis should correctly handle the input and output as expected in a competitive programming environment."

This is efficient for competitive programming where inputs are typically provided in a specific format.\n\n2. **Calculation of Contests**: The core logic involves calculating the total number of problems and determining how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by `K`. This is a simple and effective way to determine the number of contests.\n\n3. **Limiting by Days**: The solution uses the `min()` function to ensure that the number of contests does not exceed the number of available days `D`. This is a crucial step to ensure the solution adheres to the problem constraints.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\n\n- **Function Call**: Initially, I defined a function but forgot to call it, which led to no output being generated. This was a simple oversight but highlights the importance of ensuring that all parts of the code are executed.\n\n- **Input Parsing**: My approach involved parsing the input into a structured format before processing, which is useful for clarity but can be overkill for simple problems. The official solution's direct approach is more efficient in this context.\n\n- **Output**: The official solution directly prints the result within the loop, which is a common practice in competitive programming to reduce complexity and improve performance.\n\nOverall, the official solution is concise and efficient, demonstrating the importance of simplicity and directness in competitive programming. This exercise reinforced the need to carefully handle input and output and to ensure that all parts of the code are executed as intended."

For each test case, it first computes the total number of problems available by summing the list of daily problems. It then determines the maximum possible contests by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest. The actual number of contests is the lesser of this value and the maximum number of days available. The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed sequentially.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to optimize the use of limited resources over a fixed period. Specifically, it applies to situations where you have a set of resources (in this case, problems) that need to be grouped into units (contests) with a fixed size, and you are constrained by a maximum number of units you can use per time period (days). This can be applied to project management, event planning, or any situation where batching of resources is required under time constraints. The solution involves calculating the total available resources, determining how many complete units can be formed, and then limiting this by the time constraint."
