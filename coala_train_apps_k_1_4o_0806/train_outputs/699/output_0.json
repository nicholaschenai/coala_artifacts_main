    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nChef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan for the next `D` days, but he cannot host more than one contest per day. Given these constraints, we need to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host in `D` days.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up the total number of problems created by all setters.\n2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the available problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.\n3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_contests(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, D = test_case[0]\n        A = test_case[1]\n        \n        total_problems = sum(A)\n        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K\n        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)\n        \n        print(max_contests)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_contests(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, D = test_case[0]\n        A = test_case[1]\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of problems available\n        total_problems = sum(A)\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed\n        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K\n        \n        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D\n        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(max_contests)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 5\n# test_cases = [\n#     ((1, 5, 31), [4]),\n#     ((1, 10, 3), [23]),\n#     ((2, 5, 7), [20, 36]),\n#     ((2, 5, 10), [19, 2]),\n#     ((3, 3, 300), [1, 1, 1])\n# ]\n# max_contests(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the total number of problems, determines how many contests can be formed, and then limits this number by the number of days available. The results are printed for each test case.",
