## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Sample Output:-----
0

1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan contests for the next `D` days, but he can host at most one contest per day. The task is to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host given these constraints.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.
2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.
3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.
4. **Output the Result**: For each test case, output the maximum number of contests that can be hosted.

### Pseudocode

```
for each test case:
    read N, K, D
    read the list of problems created by each setter
    total_problems = sum of all problems
    max_contests = total_problems // K
    result = min(max_contests, D)
    print result
```

### Python Solution

```python
def max_division_3_contests():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        D = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        problems = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        total_problems = sum(problems)
        max_contests = total_problems // K
        results.append(min(max_contests, D))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, we extract the number of setters `N`, the number of problems needed per contest `K`, and the number of days `D`.
- **Calculate Total Problems**: We sum up the problems from all setters.
- **Determine Maximum Contests**: We calculate how many contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by `K`.
- **Limit by Days**: We take the minimum of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days `D`.
- **Output**: We store the result for each test case and print them at the end.

        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

        1. **Reading Input**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach, but we need to ensure that the input is being processed correctly.

        2. **Output**: The code appends results to a list and then writes them all at once using `sys.stdout.write()`. This should work, but we need to ensure that the results are being computed and stored correctly.

        3. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is likely the reason why no output is being produced. The function needs to be called to execute the logic.

        4. **Logic and Computation**: The logic for computing the number of subsets seems correct based on the problem statement. However, we need to ensure that the precomputation of factorials and inverses is correct and that the binomial coefficient and power of two calculations are accurate.

        5. **Edge Cases**: We should ensure that edge cases, such as when \(K > I\), are handled correctly by returning 0.

        Let's fix the issue by ensuring the `solve()` function is called and verify the logic step-by-step.

        Here's the corrected code:

        ```python
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
            factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverse_factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    
            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD
    
            inverse_factorial[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD - 2, MOD)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverse_factorial[i] = inverse_factorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD
    
            return factorial, inverse_factorial

            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % MOD * inverse_factorial[n - k] % MOD

                for _ in range(Q):
                    I = int(data[index])
                    K = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        binom = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorial, inverse_factorial)
                        power_of_two = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = binom * power_of_two % MOD

        ### Key Fixes:
        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
        - **Verification**: Double-checked the logic for computing binomial coefficients and powers of two to ensure correctness.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan for the next `D` days, but he cannot host more than one contest per day. Given these constraints, we need to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host in `D` days.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up the total number of problems created by all setters.
2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the available problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.
3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_contests(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        total_problems = sum(A)
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        print(max_contests)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 5
# test_cases = [
#     ((1, 5, 31), [4]),

This solution reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the total number of problems, determines how many contests can be formed, and then limits this number by the number of days available. The results are printed for each test case.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (40 points):
- $N = 1$
- $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

1 10 3
23
2 5 7

2 5 10
19 2
3 3 300
1 1 1

-----Sample Output:-----
0
2
7
4
1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution:

1. **Function Call**: The function `max_contests` is defined but never called. This is why no output is detected. The function needs to be called with the appropriate input.

2. **Input Handling**: The solution assumes that the input is already parsed into a structured format (`test_cases`), but in a real scenario, the input is typically read from standard input as a string. We need to parse this input correctly.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and then printed, but the function is not called, so this step is never reached.

To fix these issues, we need to:

- Read the input from standard input.
- Parse the input into the required format.
- Call the function with the parsed input.
- Ensure the function prints the results directly.

Let's correct the solution with these considerations:

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse the input
T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []

for _ in range(T):
    N, K, D = map(int, data[index:index+3])
    index += 3
    A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))
    index += N
    test_cases.append(((N, K, D), A))

# Call the function with the parsed input
max_contests(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Input Reading**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings.
- **Input Parsing**: We parse the number of test cases `T` and then iterate over each test case to extract `N`, `K`, `D`, and the list `A`.
- **Function Call**: We call `max_contests` with the parsed input.
- **Output**: The function prints the results directly for each test case. 

This should correctly handle the input and output as expected in a competitive programming environment.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan for the next `D` days, but he cannot host more than one contest per day. Given these constraints, we need to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host in `D` days.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up the total number of problems created by all setters.
2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the available problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.
3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_contests(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        total_problems = sum(A)
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        print(max_contests)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 5
# test_cases = [
#     ((1, 5, 31), [4]),
#     ((1, 10, 3), [23]),
#     ((2, 5, 7), [20, 36]),
#     ((2, 5, 10), [19, 2]),
#     ((3, 3, 300), [1, 1, 1])
# ]
# max_contests(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the total number of problems, determines how many contests can be formed, and then limits this number by the number of days available. The results are printed for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution:

1. **Function Call**: The function `max_contests` is defined but never called. This is why no output is detected. The function needs to be called with the appropriate input.

2. **Input Handling**: The solution assumes that the input is already parsed into a structured format (`test_cases`), but in a real scenario, the input is typically read from standard input as a string. We need to parse this input correctly.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and then printed, but the function is not called, so this step is never reached.

To fix these issues, we need to:

- Read the input from standard input.
- Parse the input into the required format.
- Call the function with the parsed input.
- Ensure the function prints the results directly.

Let's correct the solution with these considerations:

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse the input
T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []

for _ in range(T):
    N, K, D = map(int, data[index:index+3])
    index += 3
    A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))
    index += N
    test_cases.append(((N, K, D), A))

# Call the function with the parsed input
max_contests(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Input Reading**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings.
- **Input Parsing**: We parse the number of test cases `T` and then iterate over each test case to extract `N`, `K`, `D`, and the list `A`.
- **Function Call**: We call `max_contests` with the parsed input.
- **Output**: The function prints the results directly for each test case. 

This should correctly handle the input and output as expected in a competitive programming environment.

## Memories

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

        1. **Reading Input**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach, but we need to ensure that the input is being processed correctly.

        2. **Output**: The code appends results to a list and then writes them all at once using `sys.stdout.write()`. This should work, but we need to ensure that the results are being computed and stored correctly.

        3. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is likely the reason why no output is being produced. The function needs to be called to execute the logic.

        4. **Logic and Computation**: The logic for computing the number of subsets seems correct based on the problem statement. However, we need to ensure that the precomputation of factorials and inverses is correct and that the binomial coefficient and power of two calculations are accurate.

        5. **Edge Cases**: We should ensure that edge cases, such as when \(K > I\), are handled correctly by returning 0.

        Let's fix the issue by ensuring the `solve()` function is called and verify the logic step-by-step.

        Here's the corrected code:

        ```python
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
            factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverse_factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    
            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD
    
            inverse_factorial[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD - 2, MOD)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverse_factorial[i] = inverse_factorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD
    
            return factorial, inverse_factorial

        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorial, inverse_factorial):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % MOD * inverse_factorial[n - k] % MOD

        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
    
            max_n = 4000
            factorial, inverse_factorial = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n)
    
            results = []

                N = int(data[index])
                Q = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                for _ in range(Q):
                    I = int(data[index])
                    K = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        binom = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorial, inverse_factorial)
                        power_of_two = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = binom * power_of_two % MOD
                        results.append(result)

        # Call the solve function to execute the solution
        solve()
        ```

        ### Key Fixes:
        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
        - **Verification**: Double-checked the logic for computing binomial coefficients and powers of two to ensure correctness.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (40 points):
- $N = 1$
- $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

1 10 3
23

2 5 10
19 2
3 3 300
1 1 1

-----Sample Output:-----
0
2
7
4
1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 699 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan for the next `D` days, but he cannot host more than one contest per day. Given these constraints, we need to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host in `D` days.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up the total number of problems created by all setters.
2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the available problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.
3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_contests(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        total_problems = sum(A)
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        print(max_contests)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 5
# test_cases = [
#     ((1, 5, 31), [4]),
#     ((1, 10, 3), [23]),
#     ((2, 5, 7), [20, 36]),
#     ((2, 5, 10), [19, 2]),
#     ((3, 3, 300), [1, 1, 1])
# ]
# max_contests(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the total number of problems, determines how many contests can be formed, and then limits this number by the number of days available. The results are printed for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution:

1. **Function Call**: The function `max_contests` is defined but never called. This is why no output is detected. The function needs to be called with the appropriate input.

2. **Input Handling**: The solution assumes that the input is already parsed into a structured format (`test_cases`), but in a real scenario, the input is typically read from standard input as a string. We need to parse this input correctly.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and then printed, but the function is not called, so this step is never reached.

To fix these issues, we need to:

- Read the input from standard input.
- Parse the input into the required format.
- Call the function with the parsed input.
- Ensure the function prints the results directly.

Let's correct the solution with these considerations:

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse the input
T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []

for _ in range(T):
    N, K, D = map(int, data[index:index+3])
    index += 3
    A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))
    index += N
    test_cases.append(((N, K, D), A))

# Call the function with the parsed input
max_contests(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Input Reading**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings.
- **Input Parsing**: We parse the number of test cases `T` and then iterate over each test case to extract `N`, `K`, `D`, and the list `A`.
- **Function Call**: We call `max_contests` with the parsed input.
- **Output**: The function prints the results directly for each test case. 

This should correctly handle the input and output as expected in a competitive programming environment.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host given a set of constraints. The core concept was to calculate how many contests can be formed with the available problems and then limit this number by the number of days available.

### Key Concepts:
- **Problem Summation**: Calculate the total number of problems available from all setters.
- **Division Calculation**: Determine how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`).
- **Limiting Factor**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days (`D`), so the result is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.

### Strategies:
- **Input Parsing**: Initially, the function was not called, leading to no output. The solution required reading input from standard input and parsing it correctly.
- **Function Execution**: Ensuring the function is called with the parsed input and outputs results directly.

### Lessons Learned:
- Always ensure that functions are called with the correct input, especially in competitive programming environments where input is typically read from standard input.
- Properly parse and structure input data to match the expected format for processing.
- Consider edge cases where the number of contests is limited by either the number of problems or the number of days.

The final solution involved reading input, parsing it into a structured format, calculating the maximum number of contests, and printing the results. This approach successfully handled the constraints and provided the correct output.

- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan for the next `D` days, but he cannot host more than one contest per day. Given these constraints, we need to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host in `D` days.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up the total number of problems created by all setters.
2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the available problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.
3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_contests(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        total_problems = sum(A)
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        print(max_contests)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 5
# test_cases = [
#     ((1, 5, 31), [4]),

This solution reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the total number of problems, determines how many contests can be formed, and then limits this number by the number of days available. The results are printed for each test case.

2. **Input Handling**: The solution assumes that the input is already parsed into a structured format (`test_cases`), but in a real scenario, the input is typically read from standard input as a string. We need to parse this input correctly.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and then printed, but the function is not called, so this step is never reached.

To fix these issues, we need to:

- Read the input from standard input.
- Parse the input into the required format.
- Call the function with the parsed input.
- Ensure the function prints the results directly.

Let's correct the solution with these considerations:

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse the input
T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []

for _ in range(T):
    N, K, D = map(int, data[index:index+3])
    index += 3
    A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))
    index += N
    test_cases.append(((N, K, D), A))

# Call the function with the parsed input
max_contests(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Input Reading**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings.
- **Input Parsing**: We parse the number of test cases `T` and then iterate over each test case to extract `N`, `K`, `D`, and the list `A`.
- **Function Call**: We call `max_contests` with the parsed input.
- **Output**: The function prints the results directly for each test case. 

This should correctly handle the input and output as expected in a competitive programming environment.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] In this exercise, the problem was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host given a set of constraints. The task involved reading input, calculating the number of possible contests, and ensuring the output was correctly formatted.

### Key Insights:

1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses a straightforward approach to read input directly from standard input using `input()` and processes it in a loop. This is efficient for competitive programming where inputs are typically provided in a specific format.

2. **Calculation of Contests**: The core logic involves calculating the total number of problems and determining how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by `K`. This is a simple and effective way to determine the number of contests.

3. **Limiting by Days**: The solution uses the `min()` function to ensure that the number of contests does not exceed the number of available days `D`. This is a crucial step to ensure the solution adheres to the problem constraints.

### Reflection on My Approach:

- **Function Call**: Initially, I defined a function but forgot to call it, which led to no output being generated. This was a simple oversight but highlights the importance of ensuring that all parts of the code are executed.

- **Input Parsing**: My approach involved parsing the input into a structured format before processing, which is useful for clarity but can be overkill for simple problems. The official solution's direct approach is more efficient in this context.

- **Output**: The official solution directly prints the result within the loop, which is a common practice in competitive programming to reduce complexity and improve performance.

Overall, the official solution is concise and efficient, demonstrating the importance of simplicity and directness in competitive programming. This exercise reinforced the need to carefully handle input and output and to ensure that all parts of the code are executed as intended.

[Problem]
    Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
    A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
    Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
    - The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
    - $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
    - $1 \le D \le 10^9$
    - $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (40 points):
    - $N = 1$
    - $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
    Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    5
    1 5 31
    4
    1 10 3

    20 36

    1 1 1

    -----Sample Output:-----
    0
    2
    7
    4
    1

    -----Explanation:-----
    - 
    Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
    - 
    Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
    - 
    Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.
