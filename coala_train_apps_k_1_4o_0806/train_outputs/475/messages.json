This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.\n\n    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.\n\n    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.\n\n    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This has a time complexity of \\(O(n^2 \\log n)\\), which is feasible for the given constraints but not optimal.\n\n- **Efficiency**: The official solution is more efficient, particularly in its use of prefix sums and binary search, which reduces unnecessary computations and handles large input sizes more gracefully.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Prefix Sums**: Understanding and applying prefix sums can significantly optimize problems involving subarray sums. This technique is crucial for reducing time complexity in such problems.\n\n- **Advanced Techniques**: The combination of two-pointer methods and binary search in the official solution is a reminder of the power of combining multiple algorithmic techniques to solve complex problems efficiently.\n\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: Always consider the constraints and ensure that solutions handle large numbers appropriately using modular arithmetic.\n\nIn future problems involving subarray sums or similar constructs, these insights will be invaluable in crafting efficient and effective solutions."
