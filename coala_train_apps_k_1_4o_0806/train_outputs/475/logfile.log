## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        
```

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of positive integers. We need to calculate the sum of all possible non-empty continuous subarrays, sort these sums, and then find the sum of a specific range of these sorted sums. The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, generate all possible non-empty continuous subarrays from the given array.
   - Calculate the sum for each of these subarrays.
   - Store all these sums in a list.
   - Sort the list of sums in non-decreasing order.
   - Calculate the sum of the elements in this sorted list from the `left` index to the `right` index (1-based index).
   - Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize an empty list `subarray_sums`
   For each starting index `i` from 0 to n-1:
       Initialize `current_sum` to 0
       For each ending index `j` from `i` to n-1:
           Add `nums[j]` to `current_sum`
           Append `current_sum` to `subarray_sums`
   Sort `subarray_sums`
   Calculate the sum of elements from index `left-1` to `right-1` in `subarray_sums`
   Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # Initialize an empty list to store the sums of subarrays
        subarray_sums = []
        
        # Generate all possible subarrays
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                # Calculate the sum of the subarray from i to j
                current_sum += nums[j]
                # Append the sum to the list
                subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
        
        # Sort the list of subarray sums
        subarray_sums.sort()
        
        # Calculate the sum of the elements from index left-1 to right-1
        result = sum(subarray_sums[left-1:right])
        
        # Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7
        return result % (10**9 + 7)
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and efficiently calculates the required sum of subarray sums within the specified range.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Prefix Sum Optimization**: My approach used a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.

    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.

    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.

    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers. We need to compute the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays of `nums`, sort these sums in non-decreasing order, and then return the sum of the elements from index `left` to `right` (1-based index) in this sorted list. The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Generate Subarray Sums**: For each possible subarray in `nums`, calculate its sum. This involves iterating over all possible starting and ending indices of subarrays.

2. **Sort the Sums**: Once all subarray sums are computed, sort them in non-decreasing order.

3. **Calculate the Range Sum**: Sum the elements from the `left` to `right` indices in the sorted list of sums. Since the indices are 1-based, adjust them to 0-based for Python list indexing.

4. **Modulo Operation**: Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

## Pseudocode

```
function rangeSum(nums, n, left, right):
    subarray_sums = []
    
    for start in range(n):
        current_sum = 0
        for end in range(start, n):
            current_sum += nums[end]
            subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
    
    sort subarray_sums
    
    result = 0
    for i from left-1 to right-1:
        result += subarray_sums[i]
    
    return result modulo (10^9 + 7)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # List to store all subarray sums
        subarray_sums = []
        
        # Calculate all subarray sums
        for start in range(n):
            current_sum = 0

        # Sort the subarray sums
        subarray_sums.sort()

        # Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7
        return result % (10**9 + 7)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first initialize an empty list `subarray_sums` to store the sums of all possible subarrays.
- We use two nested loops to iterate over all possible subarrays. The outer loop sets the starting index, and the inner loop calculates the sum for each subarray starting at that index.
- After computing all subarray sums, we sort them.
- We then sum the elements from the `left-1` to `right-1` indices in the sorted list (adjusting for 0-based indexing).
- Finally, we return the sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Generate Subarray Sums**: For each possible subarray in `nums`, calculate its sum. This involves iterating over all possible starting and ending indices of subarrays.

2. **Sort the Sums**: Once all subarray sums are computed, sort them in non-decreasing order.

3. **Calculate the Range Sum**: Sum the elements from the `left` to `right` indices in the sorted list of sums. Since the indices are 1-based, adjust them to 0-based for Python list indexing.

4. **Modulo Operation**: Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

## Pseudocode

```
function rangeSum(nums, n, left, right):
    subarray_sums = []
    
    for start in range(n):
        current_sum = 0
        for end in range(start, n):
            current_sum += nums[end]
            subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
    
    sort subarray_sums
    
    result = 0
    for i from left-1 to right-1:
        result += subarray_sums[i]
    
    return result modulo (10^9 + 7)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # List to store all subarray sums
        subarray_sums = []
        
        # Calculate all subarray sums
        for start in range(n):
            current_sum = 0
            for end in range(start, n):
                current_sum += nums[end]
                subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
        
        # Sort the subarray sums
        subarray_sums.sort()
        
        # Calculate the sum from index left to right (1-based index)
        result = 0
        for i in range(left - 1, right):
            result += subarray_sums[i]
        
        # Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7
        return result % (10**9 + 7)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first initialize an empty list `subarray_sums` to store the sums of all possible subarrays.
- We use two nested loops to iterate over all possible subarrays. The outer loop sets the starting index, and the inner loop calculates the sum for each subarray starting at that index.
- After computing all subarray sums, we sort them.
- We then sum the elements from the `left-1` to `right-1` indices in the sorted list (adjusting for 0-based indexing).
- Finally, we return the sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] In this problem, the main task was to compute the sums of all non-empty continuous subarrays of a given array, sort these sums, and then calculate the sum of a specified range of these sorted sums. The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.

### Core Concepts and Patterns:
- **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.
- **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.

### Strategies:
- **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.
- **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.
- **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.

### Code Snippet:
```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        subarray_sums = []
        for start in range(n):
            current_sum = 0
            for end in range(start, n):
                current_sum += nums[end]
                subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
        subarray_sums.sort()
        result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])
        return result % (10**9 + 7)
```

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

### Insights from the Official Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Utilization**: The official solution leverages prefix sums to efficiently calculate subarray sums. This is a powerful technique that reduces the complexity of calculating sums of subarrays by precomputing cumulative sums.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: The use of a two-pointer technique to count subarray sums under a certain score is an efficient way to handle the problem. This approach avoids recalculating sums from scratch and instead uses the properties of prefix sums.

3. **Binary Search for Optimization**: The solution employs binary search to find the k-th smallest subarray sum. This is a clever optimization that reduces the problem of finding specific subarray sums to a more manageable search problem.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution correctly handles large numbers by using modular arithmetic, ensuring that the results fit within the required constraints.

### Comparison with My Approach

- **Complexity**: My initial approach was straightforward but less efficient, as it involved generating all possible subarray sums and sorting them. This has a time complexity of \(O(n^2 \log n)\), which is feasible for the given constraints but not optimal.

- **Efficiency**: The official solution is more efficient, particularly in its use of prefix sums and binary search, which reduces unnecessary computations and handles large input sizes more gracefully.

### Key Takeaways

- **Prefix Sums**: Understanding and applying prefix sums can significantly optimize problems involving subarray sums. This technique is crucial for reducing time complexity in such problems.

- **Advanced Techniques**: The combination of two-pointer methods and binary search in the official solution is a reminder of the power of combining multiple algorithmic techniques to solve complex problems efficiently.

- **Modular Arithmetic**: Always consider the constraints and ensure that solutions handle large numbers appropriately using modular arithmetic.

In future problems involving subarray sums or similar constructs, these insights will be invaluable in crafting efficient and effective solutions.
