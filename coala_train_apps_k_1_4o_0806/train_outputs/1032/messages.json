The challenge was to compute the number of particles at a given time `N` efficiently, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as `10^18`. Direct computation of factorials for such large numbers is impractical, so the solution involved computing the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` iteratively.\n\nThe key strategy was to use modular arithmetic to keep the numbers manageable and prevent overflow. This involved computing the factorial of `N` modulo `10^6 + 3` and then multiplying it by the initial number of particles `X`, again taking the result modulo `10^6 + 3`.\n\nThe solution was implemented efficiently by reading input in bulk and processing each test case in a loop. The use of a helper function `factorial_mod` allowed for clean and modular code. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness of the approach.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers and the need for efficient algorithms when dealing with high constraints."

This approach is insightful because it leverages the fact that factorials grow very quickly, and for any `n` greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` will be zero due to the properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Precomputation of Factorials**: The solution precomputes the factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` for all numbers up to `10^6 + 3`. This allows for constant-time retrieval of factorial values during each test case, significantly speeding up the process.\n\n2. **Handling Large `n`**: If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` is zero. This is because `n!` will include `10^6 + 3` as a factor, making the result zero when taken modulo `10^6 + 3`.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: By precomputing the factorials, the solution avoids recalculating them for each test case, which is crucial given the constraints. This reduces the time complexity for each test case to O(1) after the initial precomputation.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\n\nMy initial approach involved calculating the factorial for each test case, which is inefficient given the constraints. The official solution's precomputation strategy is a significant improvement, as it reduces redundant calculations and handles large values of `n` effectively. This experience highlights the importance of considering precomputation and modular arithmetic properties when dealing with large numbers and repetitive calculations."
