Help Saurabh with his Chemistry Assignment.

Saurabh has been given a chemistry assignment by Ruby Mam. Though the assignment is simple but

Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.

So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesnâ€™t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment

is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in

box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the

number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.

-----Input-----
The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space

separated integers N and X .

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo

10^6+3

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100000
- 1 â‰¤ N,X â‰¤ 10^18

-----Example-----
Input:
2
1 2

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. We have multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` modulo `10^6 + 3`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Growth**: 
   - At `t=0`, the number of particles is `X`.
   - At `t=1`, the number of particles is `1 * X`.
   - At `t=2`, the number of particles is `2 * (1 * X)`.
   - At `t=3`, the number of particles is `3 * (2 * (1 * X))`, and so on.
   - This pattern shows that the number of particles at time `N` is `N! * X`.

2. **Handling Large Numbers**:
   - Direct computation of factorials for large `N` is not feasible due to size.
   - We need to compute `N! * X % (10^6 + 3)`.
   - Use modular arithmetic properties to compute the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3`.

3. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Use a loop to compute the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` iteratively.
   - Multiply the result by `X` and take modulo `10^6 + 3`.

## Pseudocode

```
MOD = 10^6 + 3

function compute_particles(N, X):
    if N == 0:
        return X % MOD
    factorial_mod = 1
    for i from 1 to N:
        factorial_mod = (factorial_mod * i) % MOD
    result = (factorial_mod * X) % MOD
    return result

read T
for each test case:
    read N, X
    print compute_particles(N, X)
```

## Python Solution

```python
def compute_particles(N, X):
    MOD = 10**6 + 3
    if N == 0:
        # If N is 0, the number of particles is simply X
        return X % MOD
    
    factorial_mod = 1
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        factorial_mod = (factorial_mod * i) % MOD
    
    result = (factorial_mod * X) % MOD
    return result

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        X = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(compute_particles(N, X))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# The main function will be called when the script is executed
# It reads from standard input and writes to standard output
```

This solution efficiently computes the number of particles at time `N` for each test case, using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We need to determine how many times all first-year, second-year, and third-year students are present on campus simultaneously over a period of `n` days. Each group of students arrives on campus at regular intervals: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on the same day within the given period.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the number of times all three groups of students are on campus at the same time over `n` days. This happens when the time is a common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

        2. **Mathematical Insight**: The times when all three groups are present are the multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of `x`, `y`, and `z`. Therefore, we need to calculate the LCM of these three numbers.

        3. **Counting Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times it fits into the total hours over `n` days (i.e., `n * 24` hours).

        4. **Iterate for Each Test Case**: For each test case, compute the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z`, and then calculate how many times this LCM fits into the total hours.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function gcd(a, b):
            while b is not 0:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a

        function lcm(a, b):
            return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

        function lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

        function calculate_audience_times(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, x, y, z = test_case
                total_hours = N * 24
                lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
                audience_times = total_hours // lcm_xyz
                results.append(audience_times)
            return results

        # Read input
        T = read integer
        test_cases = []
        for i from 1 to T:
            N = read integer
            x, y, z = read three integers
            test_cases.append((N, x, y, z))

        # Calculate results
        results = calculate_audience_times(T, test_cases)

        # Output results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

We need to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. We are given multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` modulo `10^6 + 3`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Growth**: At time `t=0`, there are `X` particles. At time `t=1`, there are `1 * X` particles. At time `t=2`, there are `2 * (1 * X)` particles, and so on. This pattern shows that the number of particles at time `t` is `t! * X`, where `t!` is the factorial of `t`.

2. **Modulo Operation**: Since the number of particles can be very large, we need to compute the result modulo `10^6 + 3`.

3. **Efficient Computation**: Direct computation of factorial for large `N` is not feasible due to time and space constraints. Instead, we can compute the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` iteratively.

4. **Iterate for Each Test Case**: For each test case, compute the factorial of `N` modulo `10^6 + 3`, multiply it by `X`, and then take the result modulo `10^6 + 3`.

## Pseudocode

```
function factorial_mod(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i from 1 to n:
        result = (result * i) % mod
    return result

# Calculate results

Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.

So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesnâ€™t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment

is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in

box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the

number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.

-----Input-----
The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space

separated integers N and X .

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo

10^6+3

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. We are given multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` modulo `10^6 + 3`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Growth**: At time `t=0`, there are `X` particles. At time `t=1`, there are `1 * X` particles. At time `t=2`, there are `2 * (1 * X)` particles, and so on. This pattern shows that the number of particles at time `t` is `t! * X`, where `t!` is the factorial of `t`.

2. **Modulo Operation**: Since the number of particles can be very large, we need to compute the result modulo `10^6 + 3`.

3. **Efficient Computation**: Direct computation of factorial for large `N` is not feasible due to time and space constraints. Instead, we can compute the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` iteratively.

4. **Iterate for Each Test Case**: For each test case, compute the factorial of `N` modulo `10^6 + 3`, multiply it by `X`, and then take the result modulo `10^6 + 3`.

## Pseudocode

```
function factorial_mod(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i from 1 to n:
        result = (result * i) % mod
    return result

function calculate_particles(T, test_cases):
    MOD = 10^6 + 3
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, X = test_case
        factorial_n_mod = factorial_mod(N, MOD)
        particles = (factorial_n_mod * X) % MOD
        results.append(particles)
    return results

# Read input
T = read integer
test_cases = []
for i from 1 to T:
    N, X = read two integers
    test_cases.append((N, X))

# Calculate results

# Output results

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was understanding the growth pattern of particles in a box over time, which follows a factorial pattern. The challenge was to compute the number of particles at a given time `N` efficiently, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as `10^18`. Direct computation of factorials for such large numbers is impractical, so the solution involved computing the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` iteratively.

The key strategy was to use modular arithmetic to keep the numbers manageable and prevent overflow. This involved computing the factorial of `N` modulo `10^6 + 3` and then multiplying it by the initial number of particles `X`, again taking the result modulo `10^6 + 3`.

The solution was implemented efficiently by reading input in bulk and processing each test case in a loop. The use of a helper function `factorial_mod` allowed for clean and modular code. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness of the approach.

This problem reinforced the importance of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers and the need for efficient algorithms when dealing with high constraints.

We need to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. We are given multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` modulo `10^6 + 3`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Growth**: At time `t=0`, there are `X` particles. At time `t=1`, there are `1 * X` particles. At time `t=2`, there are `2 * (1 * X)` particles, and so on. This pattern shows that the number of particles at time `t` is `t! * X`, where `t!` is the factorial of `t`.

2. **Modulo Operation**: Since the number of particles can be very large, we need to compute the result modulo `10^6 + 3`.

3. **Efficient Computation**: Direct computation of factorial for large `N` is not feasible due to time and space constraints. Instead, we can compute the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` iteratively.

4. **Iterate for Each Test Case**: For each test case, compute the factorial of `N` modulo `10^6 + 3`, multiply it by `X`, and then take the result modulo `10^6 + 3`.

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

for __ in range(eval(input())):
 n, x = list(map(int, input().split()))
 if n>=M: print(0)
 else: print((a[n]*x)%M)


INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] The official solution provides an efficient way to handle the problem by precomputing factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` up to a certain limit. This approach is insightful because it leverages the fact that factorials grow very quickly, and for any `n` greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` will be zero due to the properties of modular arithmetic.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials**: The solution precomputes the factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` for all numbers up to `10^6 + 3`. This allows for constant-time retrieval of factorial values during each test case, significantly speeding up the process.

2. **Handling Large `n`**: If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` is zero. This is because `n!` will include `10^6 + 3` as a factor, making the result zero when taken modulo `10^6 + 3`.

3. **Efficiency**: By precomputing the factorials, the solution avoids recalculating them for each test case, which is crucial given the constraints. This reduces the time complexity for each test case to O(1) after the initial precomputation.

### Reflection on My Approach:

My initial approach involved calculating the factorial for each test case, which is inefficient given the constraints. The official solution's precomputation strategy is a significant improvement, as it reduces redundant calculations and handles large values of `n` effectively. This experience highlights the importance of considering precomputation and modular arithmetic properties when dealing with large numbers and repetitive calculations.
