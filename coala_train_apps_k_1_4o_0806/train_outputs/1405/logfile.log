INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a game scenario with `N` sabotages, each initially at level 0. There are also `N` imposters, each with a specific task. The `i-th` imposter will increase the level of the `x-th` sabotage by 1 if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `x` is equal to `i`. After all imposters have completed their tasks, we need to determine how many sabotages have reached level 5.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the GCD Condition**: The condition `gcd(i, x) = i` implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. This means that for each imposter `i`, they will increase the level of all sabotages that are multiples of `i`.

2. **Level Calculation**: For a given sabotage `x`, its level will be increased by every imposter `i` that is a divisor of `x`. Therefore, the level of a sabotage `x` is equal to the number of divisors of `x`.

3. **Counting Level 5 Sabotages**: We need to count how many numbers from 1 to `N` have exactly 5 divisors. This is equivalent to counting numbers that have exactly 5 divisors.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the constraints, directly iterating over all numbers up to `N` is not feasible. Instead, we need a mathematical insight:
   - A number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. This is because the divisors of `p^4` are `1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4`.

5. **Prime Calculation**: We need to find all prime numbers `p` such that `p^4 <= N`.

## Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read `N`.
   - Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
   - For each integer `p` starting from 2:
     - If `p^4 > N`, break the loop.
     - Check if `p` is a prime number.
     - If `p` is prime, increment `count`.
   - Output `count`.

## Python Solution

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
    count = 0
    p = 2
    while p**4 <= N:
        if is_prime(p):
            count += 1
        p += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        results.append(count_sabotages_at_level_5(N))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution efficiently calculates the number of sabotages at level 5 by leveraging the mathematical property that a number with exactly 5 divisors must be of the form `p^4`, where `p` is a prime number. The function `is_prime` is used to check the primality of numbers, and the main function handles input and output.

Also, here are some of your memories.
Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a game scenario with `N` sabotages, each initially at level 0. There are `N` imposters, and each imposter `i` can increase the level of a sabotage `x` by 1 if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `x` is equal to `i`. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have completed their tasks.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: The condition `gcd(i, x) = i` implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. Therefore, for each sabotage `x`, we need to count how many divisors it has.

2. **Level 5 Requirement**: A sabotage reaches level 5 if it has exactly 5 divisors. We need to find how many numbers from 1 to `N` have exactly 5 divisors.

3. **Divisor Count Insight**: A number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. This is because the divisors of `p^4` are `1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4`.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each test case, we need to count numbers of the form `p^4` that are less than or equal to `N`. This can be done by iterating over possible prime numbers `p` and checking if `p^4 <= N`.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
    count = 0
    p = 2
    while p^4 <= N:
        if p is prime:
            count += 1
        p += 1
    return count

function is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i from 2 to sqrt(num):

    for each test case:
        read N
        result = count_sabotages_at_level_5(N)

        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

 ### Problem Restatement

We have a game scenario with `N` sabotages, each initially at level 0. There are `N` imposters, and each imposter `i` can increase the level of a sabotage `x` by 1 if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `x` is equal to `i`. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have completed their tasks.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: The condition `gcd(i, x) = i` implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. Therefore, for each sabotage `x`, we need to count how many divisors it has.

2. **Level 5 Requirement**: A sabotage reaches level 5 if it has exactly 5 divisors. We need to find how many numbers from 1 to `N` have exactly 5 divisors.

3. **Divisor Count Insight**: A number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. This is because the divisors of `p^4` are `1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4`.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each test case, we need to count numbers of the form `p^4` that are less than or equal to `N`. This can be done by iterating over possible prime numbers `p` and checking if `p^4 <= N`.

### Pseudocode

function count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
    count = 0
    p = 2
    while p^4 <= N:
        if p is prime:

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a game scenario with `N` sabotages, each initially at level 0. There are `N` imposters, and each imposter `i` can increase the level of a sabotage `x` by 1 if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `x` is equal to `i`. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have completed their tasks.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: The condition `gcd(i, x) = i` implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. Therefore, for each sabotage `x`, we need to count how many divisors it has.

2. **Level 5 Requirement**: A sabotage reaches level 5 if it has exactly 5 divisors. We need to find how many numbers from 1 to `N` have exactly 5 divisors.

3. **Divisor Count Insight**: A number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. This is because the divisors of `p^4` are `1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4`.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each test case, we need to count numbers of the form `p^4` that are less than or equal to `N`. This can be done by iterating over possible prime numbers `p` and checking if `p^4 <= N`.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
    count = 0
    p = 2
    while p^4 <= N:
        if p is prime:
            count += 1
        p += 1
    return count

function is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i from 2 to sqrt(num):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = count_sabotages_at_level_5(N)
        print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
    count = 0
    p = 2
    while p**4 <= N:
        if is_prime(p):
            count += 1
        p += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = count_sabotages_at_level_5(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

main()
```

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] In this problem, the key concept was understanding the condition `gcd(i, x) = i`, which implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. The task was to determine how many sabotages reach level 5, which translates to finding numbers with exactly 5 divisors. The insight here is that a number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4`, where `p` is a prime number. This is because the divisors of `p^4` are `1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4`.

The solution involved iterating over possible prime numbers `p` and checking if `p^4` is less than or equal to `N`. The `is_prime` function was used to efficiently check for primality, leveraging trial division up to the square root of the number. This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it avoids directly counting divisors for each number up to `N`.

The main challenge was ensuring the solution could handle very large values of `N` (up to `10^18`) and a large number of test cases (up to `100,000`). The solution efficiently reads input and processes each test case, outputting the count of sabotages at level 5 for each `N`. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in divisor counts and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify the problem.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem of counting sabotages that reach level 5 was approached by identifying numbers with exactly 5 divisors, which are of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. My initial solution involved checking each number up to `N` to see if it could be expressed as `p^4` for some prime `p`. This approach was correct but could be optimized further.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Prime Sieve for Efficiency**: The official solution uses a sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute all prime numbers up to a certain limit (`32000` in this case). This is efficient for generating a list of primes, which is then used to compute `p^4` for each prime `p`.

2. **Precomputation and Binary Search**: The official solution precomputes all possible `p^4` values and stores them in a list. For each test case, it uses binary search (via the `bisect` module) to quickly count how many of these precomputed values are less than or equal to `N`. This is a significant optimization over checking each number up to `N` individually.

3. **Handling Large Inputs**: By precomputing and storing results, the solution efficiently handles the upper constraint of `N` being as large as `10^18`. The use of binary search ensures that each query is processed in logarithmic time relative to the number of precomputed `p^4` values.

#### Lessons Learned:

- **Precomputation**: When dealing with large constraints, precomputing results for a range of inputs can drastically reduce computation time during query processing.
  
- **Binary Search for Counting**: Using binary search to count elements in a sorted list is a powerful technique, especially when combined with precomputed data.

- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: This is a highly efficient algorithm for generating a list of primes and is useful in problems involving prime numbers.

These insights highlight the importance of leveraging mathematical properties and efficient algorithms to handle large input sizes effectively.
