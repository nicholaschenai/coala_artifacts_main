The `i-th` imposter will increase the level of the `x-th` sabotage by 1 if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `x` is equal to `i`. After all imposters have completed their tasks, we need to determine how many sabotages have reached level 5.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the GCD Condition**: The condition `gcd(i, x) = i` implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. This means that for each imposter `i`, they will increase the level of all sabotages that are multiples of `i`.\n\n2. **Level Calculation**: For a given sabotage `x`, its level will be increased by every imposter `i` that is a divisor of `x`. Therefore, the level of a sabotage `x` is equal to the number of divisors of `x`.\n\n3. **Counting Level 5 Sabotages**: We need to count how many numbers from 1 to `N` have exactly 5 divisors. This is equivalent to counting numbers that have exactly 5 divisors.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the constraints, directly iterating over all numbers up to `N` is not feasible. Instead, we need a mathematical insight:\n   - A number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. This is because the divisors of `p^4` are `1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4`.\n\n5. **Prime Calculation**: We need to find all prime numbers `p` such that `p^4 <= N`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. For each test case:\n   - Read `N`.\n   - Initialize a counter `count` to 0.\n   - For each integer `p` starting from 2:\n     - If `p^4 > N`, break the loop.\n     - Check if `p` is a prime number.\n     - If `p` is prime, increment `count`.\n   - Output `count`.\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    if num <= 3:\n        return True\n    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= num:\n        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):\n    count = 0\n    p = 2\n    while p**4 <= N:\n        if is_prime(p):\n            count += 1\n        p += 1\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        results.append(count_sabotages_at_level_5(N))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the number of sabotages at level 5 by leveraging the mathematical property that a number with exactly 5 divisors must be of the form `p^4`, where `p` is a prime number. The function `is_prime` is used to check the primality of numbers, and the main function handles input and output."

The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.\n    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called.

My initial solution involved checking each number up to `N` to see if it could be expressed as `p^4` for some prime `p`. This approach was correct but could be optimized further.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Prime Sieve for Efficiency**: The official solution uses a sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute all prime numbers up to a certain limit (`32000` in this case). This is efficient for generating a list of primes, which is then used to compute `p^4` for each prime `p`.\n\n2. **Precomputation and Binary Search**: The official solution precomputes all possible `p^4` values and stores them in a list. For each test case, it uses binary search (via the `bisect` module) to quickly count how many of these precomputed values are less than or equal to `N`. This is a significant optimization over checking each number up to `N` individually.\n\n3. **Handling Large Inputs**: By precomputing and storing results, the solution efficiently handles the upper constraint of `N` being as large as `10^18`. The use of binary search ensures that each query is processed in logarithmic time relative to the number of precomputed `p^4` values.\n\n#### Lessons Learned:\n\n- **Precomputation**: When dealing with large constraints, precomputing results for a range of inputs can drastically reduce computation time during query processing.\n  \n- **Binary Search for Counting**: Using binary search to count elements in a sorted list is a powerful technique, especially when combined with precomputed data.\n\n- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: This is a highly efficient algorithm for generating a list of primes and is useful in problems involving prime numbers.\n\nThese insights highlight the importance of leveraging mathematical properties and efficient algorithms to handle large input sizes effectively."
