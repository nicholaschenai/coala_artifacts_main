    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nAlice has a hand of cards represented as an array of integers. She wants to rearrange these cards into groups where each group has exactly `W` cards, and the cards in each group are consecutive integers. We need to determine if this rearrangement is possible.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements**: \n   - We need to form groups of size `W`.\n   - Each group must consist of consecutive integers.\n\n2. **Initial Checks**:\n   - If the total number of cards is not divisible by `W`, it's impossible to form the required groups, so return `False`.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each card.\n   - Sort the unique cards.\n   - Try to form groups starting from the smallest card:\n     - For each card, if it is available, attempt to form a group of `W` consecutive cards.\n     - Decrease the count of each card in the group by 1.\n     - If any card needed for a group is not available, return `False`.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If `W` is 1, any hand can be grouped trivially.\n   - If the hand is empty, return `True` since no groups are needed.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction isNStraightHand(hand, W):\n    if length of hand % W != 0:\n        return False\n\n    count = dictionary to count occurrences of each card\n    for card in hand:\n        increment count[card]\n\n    sort the unique cards in hand\n\n    for card in sorted unique cards:\n        while count[card] > 0:\n            for i from 0 to W-1:\n                if count[card + i] <= 0:\n                    return False\n                decrement count[card + i]\n\n    return True\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], W: int) -> bool:\n        if len(hand) % W != 0:\n            return False\n        \n        # Count the occurrences of each card\n        count = {}\n        for card in hand:\n            if card in count:\n                count[card] += 1\n            else:\n                count[card] = 1\n        \n        # Sort the unique cards\n        unique_cards = sorted(count.keys())\n        \n        # Try to form groups starting from the smallest card\n        for card in unique_cards:\n            while count[card] > 0:\n                # Try to form a group starting with this card\n                for i in range(W):\n                    if count.get(card + i, 0) <= 0:\n                        return False\n                    count[card + i] -= 1\n        \n        return True\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We first check if the total number of cards is divisible by `W`. If not, it's impossible to form the groups, so we return `False`.\n- We use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each card.\n- We sort the unique cards to ensure we process them in order.\n- For each card, while it is available, we attempt to form a group of `W` consecutive cards.\n- If at any point a required card is not available, we return `False`.\n- If we successfully form all groups, we return `True`.",
