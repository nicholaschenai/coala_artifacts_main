    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem involves simulating the movement of people along a number line with roadworks blocking certain points at specific times. The key challenge is to efficiently determine how far each person can walk before encountering a blocked point or walking indefinitely. This requires careful event processing and simulation of movement.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\n1. **Event Processing**: The initial strategy was to create events for the start and end of each roadwork and sort them by time. This approach is correct and necessary for efficiently updating the status of blocked points.\n\n2. **Simulating Movement**: The main challenge was accurately simulating each person's walk. The initial attempts failed because the logic did not correctly handle the transition between events and the checking of blocked points. The assumption that a person could walk to the next event time without encountering a blocked point was flawed.\n\n3. **Handling Indefinite Walking**: The solution needed to correctly identify when a person would walk indefinitely, which occurs when there are no more events and the current position is not blocked.\n\n#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n- **Function Execution**: Initially, the function `solve()` was defined but not called, leading to no output. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by explicitly calling the function.\n- **Incorrect Simulation Logic**: The logic for simulating the walk was not correctly checking for blocked points between events. This was fixed by ensuring that each position increment was checked against the set of blocked points.\n\n#### Final Solution\nThe final solution involves processing events to maintain a set of blocked points and simulating each person's walk by checking each position incrementally. The solution correctly handles the case where a person walks indefinitely by checking if there are no more events and the current position is not blocked. This approach ensures that the simulation is both accurate and efficient.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\nThe problem involves simulating the movement of people along a number line with roadworks blocking certain points at specific times. The challenge is to determine how far each person can walk before encountering a blocked point or if they walk indefinitely.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Event-Driven Simulation**: The official solution uses an event-driven approach, which is efficient for handling time-based changes. Events are created for the start and end of each roadwork, as well as for each person's start time. This allows the solution to process changes in the state of the road (blocked or unblocked) in chronological order.\n\n2. **Priority Queue for Blocked Points**: A priority queue (min-heap) is used to efficiently track the nearest blocked point. This is crucial because it allows the solution to quickly determine the first blocked point a person will encounter as they walk.\n\n3. **Efficient State Management**: The solution maintains a dictionary to track whether a point is currently blocked. This ensures that the priority queue only contains active blocked points, allowing for efficient updates and queries.\n\n4. **Handling Queries**: By sorting all events together (roadwork and person start times), the solution can handle each query in the context of the current state of the road. This ensures that each person's walk is simulated accurately based on the road's state at their start time.\n\n### Why the Official Solution Works\n\nThe official solution effectively combines event-driven simulation with efficient data structures (priority queue and dictionary) to manage the dynamic state of the road. This approach ensures that each person's walk is simulated accurately and efficiently, even with the large constraints of the problem.\n\n### Why My Approach Failed\n\nMy initial approach attempted to simulate each person's walk incrementally, but it did not efficiently handle the dynamic changes in the road's state. The lack of a priority queue meant that checking for blocked points was not efficient, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, my approach did not correctly handle the transition between events, which is crucial for accurately simulating the walk.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe official solution demonstrates the power of using event-driven simulation combined with efficient data structures to handle complex, dynamic problems. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the state of the system changes over time and needs to be queried efficiently.",
