    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to rooms in two houses. Each box `i` contains `i` tiles, and each house has `N` rooms with areas from `1x1` to `NxN`. The goal is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using tiles from the boxes, with the constraint that each room in one house must be paired with a room in the other house, and both must be tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each box `i`, we have `i` tiles. We need to find two rooms, one in each house, with areas `i` such that both can be completely tiled using the tiles from box `i`. This means `i` must be a perfect square, as only then can it be used to tile a room of area `i`.\n\n2. **Perfect Squares**: The number of perfect squares up to `N` determines how many rooms can be completely tiled. This is because only perfect squares can be used to tile rooms completely using tiles from a single box.\n\n3. **Counting Perfect Squares**: The number of perfect squares up to `N` is given by the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`. This is simply the integer part of the square root of `N`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. For each test case:\n   - Read the integer `N`.\n   - Calculate the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N` (i.e., `k = floor(sqrt(N))`).\n   - The result for this test case is `k`.\n\n2. Output the result for each test case.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for N in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the number of perfect squares up to N\n        k = int(math.isqrt(N))\n        results.append(k)\n    return results\n\n# Read input\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\n# Get results\nresults = count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `N` for each test case.\n- **Perfect Square Calculation**: For each `N`, we calculate the integer square root using `math.isqrt(N)`, which gives the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`.\n- **Output**: We store the results for each test case and print them sequentially.",
