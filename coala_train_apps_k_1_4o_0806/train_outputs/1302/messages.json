Each box `i` contains `i` tiles, and each house has `N` rooms with areas from `1x1` to `NxN`. The goal is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, with the condition that each room in one house must be paired with a room in the other house, and both must be tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Pairing Requirement**: For a room of size `i*i` in one house to be tiled, there must be another room of the same size in the other house that can also be tiled using the same number of tiles. This means we need `2*i*i` tiles to tile both rooms.\n\n2. **Determine Feasibility**: For each box `i`, check if `i` tiles can be used to tile two rooms of size `i*i`. This is only possible if `2*i*i <= i`, which simplifies to `2*i <= 1`, meaning `i` must be `1` or `2`.\n\n3. **Count the Rooms**: For each valid `i`, there are two rooms (one in each house) that can be tiled. Therefore, the total number of rooms that can be tiled is `2` for each valid `i`.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, determine the maximum `i` that satisfies the condition and count the rooms accordingly.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    for each N in test_cases:\n        count = 0\n        for i from 1 to N:\n            if 2*i*i <= i:\n                count += 2\n        print count\n```\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for N in test_cases:\n        count = 0\n        # We only need to check i = 1 and i = 2 because for i > 2, 2*i*i > i\n        if N >= 1:\n            count += 2  # For i = 1, two rooms can be tiled\n        if N >= 2:\n            count += 2  # For i = 2, two rooms can be tiled\n        results.append(count)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 1\n# test_cases = [16]\n# count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled.\n- **Check Valid `i` Values**: We only need to check `i = 1` and `i = 2` because for any `i > 2`, the condition `2*i*i <= i` is not satisfied.\n- **Count Rooms**: For each valid `i`, add `2` to the count because two rooms (one in each house) can be tiled.\n- **Output Results**: After processing all test cases, print the results."

The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.\n\n    #### Key Insights and Strategies\n\n    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.\n\n    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N = test_case[0]\n            A = test_case[1]\n        \n            current_sum = 0\n            possible = True\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                current_sum += A[i]\n                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n        \n            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Each box `i` contains `i` tiles, and each house has `N` rooms with areas from `1x1` to `NxN`. The goal is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using tiles from the boxes, with the constraint that each room in one house must be paired with a room in the other house, and both must be tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each box `i`, we have `i` tiles. We need to find two rooms, one in each house, with areas `i` such that both can be completely tiled using the tiles from box `i`. This means `i` must be a perfect square, as only then can it be used to tile a room of area `i`.\n\n2. **Perfect Squares**: The number of perfect squares up to `N` determines how many rooms can be completely tiled. This is because only perfect squares can be used to tile rooms completely using tiles from a single box.\n\n3. **Counting Perfect Squares**: The number of perfect squares up to `N` is given by the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`. This is simply the integer part of the square root of `N`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. For each test case:\n   - Read the integer `N`.\n   - Calculate the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N` (i.e., `k = floor(sqrt(N))`).\n   - The result for this test case is `k`.\n\n2. Output the result for each test case.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for N in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the number of perfect squares up to N\n        k = int(math.isqrt(N))\n        results.append(k)\n    return results\n\n# Read input\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\n# Get results\nresults = count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `N` for each test case.\n- **Perfect Square Calculation**: For each `N`, we calculate the integer square root using `math.isqrt(N)`, which gives the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`.\n- **Output**: We store the results for each test case and print them sequentially."

Each box `i` contains `i` tiles, and only perfect squares can be used to tile rooms completely, as they match the area of the rooms exactly.\n\nThe strategy that worked was calculating the number of perfect squares up to `N` for each test case. This is efficiently done by finding the integer square root of `N`, which gives the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`. This approach is optimal because it directly leverages the mathematical properties of perfect squares, avoiding unnecessary computations.\n\nThe implementation involved reading input, calculating the integer square root using `math.isqrt(N)`, and outputting the results. This method was straightforward and efficient, handling the constraints well, especially given the large possible value of `N` (up to `10^12`).

This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the mathematical property that the number of perfect squares up to `N` is given by the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`.\n\nThe official solution, however, introduces a different approach by dividing `N` by 2 before calculating the number of perfect squares. This effectively counts the number of rooms that can be tiled in both houses combined, as each perfect square can tile two rooms (one in each house). The final result is then doubled to account for both houses. This approach is more direct in addressing the problem's requirement to consider both houses simultaneously.\n\nOverall, both solutions are efficient, but the official solution provides a more direct interpretation of the problem by considering the pairing of rooms from the start.
