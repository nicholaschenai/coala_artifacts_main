    "summary": "In tackling the problem of finding subsets where a specific element appears at a given position, the core concept revolved around combinatorial counting and efficient computation using modular arithmetic. The problem required understanding how to use binomial coefficients to count combinations and leveraging precomputation for efficiency, given the constraints.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Combinatorial Counting**: To determine the number of subsets where an element \\(I\\) is at position \\(K\\), we used the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{I-1}{K-1}\\) to count the ways to choose \\(K-1\\) elements from the first \\(I-1\\) numbers.\n- **Power of Two**: After placing \\(I\\) at the \\(K\\)th position, the remaining elements can be any subset of numbers greater than \\(I\\), calculated as \\(2^{N-I}\\).\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: Given the large potential size of results, all calculations were done modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Strategies and Fixes:\n- **Precomputation**: Precomputing factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum \\(N\\) was crucial for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.\n- **Function Execution**: Initially, the function `solve()` was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is executed was a simple but critical fix.\n- **Input Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read()` to handle large input sizes efficiently and processing it correctly was essential for performance.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of precomputation in combinatorial problems and the need to handle large inputs and outputs efficiently in competitive programming scenarios.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves combinatorial counting, specifically determining how many subsets of a set have a particular element at a specific position when sorted. This requires understanding binomial coefficients and powers of two.\n\n2. **Precomputation for Efficiency**: My approach involved precomputing factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate binomial coefficients. This is crucial for handling large inputs efficiently, especially given the constraints.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Both my solution and the official solution correctly handle the case where \\(K > I\\), which is impossible and should return 0.\n\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly apply modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers, which is a common requirement in competitive programming to prevent overflow and ensure results fit within standard data types.\n\n5. **Official Solution's Simplicity**: The official solution uses Python's `math.factorial` for direct computation of binomial coefficients, which is straightforward but may not be as efficient for very large inputs due to repeated calculations. My approach of precomputing factorials and inverses is more efficient for large-scale queries.\n\n6. **Function Call**: A key oversight in my initial solution was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed.\n\nIn summary, the problem reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations and careful handling of input/output in competitive programming. The official solution, while straightforward, could benefit from precomputation techniques for better performance on large inputs.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThe function reads input data for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of queries. For each query, it calculates a specific result based on binomial coefficients and powers of two, using precomputed factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently compute the binomial coefficients modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). It handles multiple queries per test case, checking if the conditions for valid binomial coefficient computation are met, and appends the results to a list. Finally, it outputs all the results for the queries in the required format.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to calculate the number of subsets of a set with specific constraints, such as the position of an element in the subset. This is particularly relevant in combinatorial problems where subsets need to be generated in a sorted order, and specific elements must occupy certain positions. The use of binomial coefficients and modular arithmetic is crucial in efficiently solving problems with large constraints, such as those involving large numbers of queries or large sets. This approach is applicable in competitive programming and algorithm design, where performance and correctness under constraints are critical."
