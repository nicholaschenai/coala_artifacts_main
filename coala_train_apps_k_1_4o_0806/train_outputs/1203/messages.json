For each query, we need to determine how many subsets exist where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number `I` to be at the `K`-th position in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers smaller than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.\n\n2. **Remaining Numbers**: After placing `I` at the `K`-th position, the remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the set `{I+1, I+2, ..., N}`. The number of such numbers is `N-I`.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**:\n   - Choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers: This is done using combinations, denoted as `C(I-1, K-1)`.\n   - Choose any subset of the remaining `N-I` numbers: This is `2^(N-I)` possible subsets.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, every calculation should be done modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute combinations and powers of 2, precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. **Precompute Factorials and Inverses**:\n   - Compute factorials and their inverses up to the maximum `N` using Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverses.\n\n2. **Process Each Test Case**:\n   - For each query `(I, K)`, check if `K-1` is greater than `I-1`.

This approach is insightful because it leverages the fact that factorials grow very quickly, and for any `n` greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` will be zero due to the properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n    1. **Precomputation of Factorials**: The solution precomputes the factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` for all numbers up to `10^6 + 3`. This allows for constant-time retrieval of factorial values during each test case, significantly speeding up the process.\n\n    2. **Handling Large `n`**: If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` is zero. This is because `n!` will include `10^6 + 3` as a factor, making the result zero when taken modulo `10^6 + 3`.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**: By precomputing the factorials, the solution avoids recalculating them for each test case, which is crucial given the constraints. This reduces the time complexity for each test case to O(1) after the initial precomputation.\n\n    ### Reflection on My Approach:\n\n    My initial approach involved calculating the factorial for each test case, which is inefficient given the constraints. The official solution's precomputation strategy is a significant improvement, as it reduces redundant calculations and handles large values of `n` effectively. This experience highlights the importance of considering precomputation and modular arithmetic properties when dealing with large numbers and repetitive calculations.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.\n\n    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.\n\n    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.\n\n    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves combinatorial counting, specifically determining how many subsets of a set have a particular element at a specific position when sorted. This requires understanding binomial coefficients and powers of two.\n\n2. **Precomputation for Efficiency**: My approach involved precomputing factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate binomial coefficients. This is crucial for handling large inputs efficiently, especially given the constraints.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Both my solution and the official solution correctly handle the case where \\(K > I\\), which is impossible and should return 0.\n\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly apply modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers, which is a common requirement in competitive programming to prevent overflow and ensure results fit within standard data types.\n\n5. **Official Solution's Simplicity**: The official solution uses Python's `math.factorial` for direct computation of binomial coefficients, which is straightforward but may not be as efficient for very large inputs due to repeated calculations. My approach of precomputing factorials and inverses is more efficient for large-scale queries.\n\n6. **Function Call**: A key oversight in my initial solution was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed.\n\nIn summary, the problem reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations and careful handling of input/output in competitive programming. The official solution, while straightforward, could benefit from precomputation techniques for better performance on large inputs."

        "content": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThe function reads input data for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of queries. For each query, it calculates a specific result based on binomial coefficients and powers of two, using precomputed factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently compute the binomial coefficients modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). It handles multiple queries per test case, checking if the conditions for valid binomial coefficient computation are met, and appends the results to a list. Finally, it outputs all the results for the queries in the required format.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to calculate the number of subsets of a set with specific constraints, such as the position of an element in the subset. This is particularly relevant in combinatorial problems where subsets need to be generated in a sorted order, and specific elements must occupy certain positions. The use of binomial coefficients and modular arithmetic is crucial in efficiently solving problems with large constraints, such as those involving large numbers of queries or large sets. This approach is applicable in competitive programming and algorithm design, where performance and correctness under constraints are critical."
