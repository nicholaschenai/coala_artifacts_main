We need to determine if there are any two zebras that have spitted at each other. This means if a zebra at position `a` spits a distance `b`, it will hit another zebra at position `a + b`. We need to check if there exists a pair of zebras such that they spit at each other.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. For each zebra, calculate the position it can hit when it spits.\n2. Check if there is another zebra at that position.\n3. If a zebra at position `a` spits and hits a zebra at position `a + b`, check if the zebra at `a + b` spits back to position `a`.\n4. If such a pair is found, output \"YES\". If no such pair exists after checking all zebras, output \"NO\".\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the number of zebras `t`.\n2. Initialize a dictionary to store the position and spit distance of each zebra.\n3. For each zebra, store its position and spit distance in the dictionary.\n4. For each zebra at position `a` with spit distance `b`:\n   - Calculate the target position `a + b`.\n   - Check if there is a zebra at the target position.\n   - If there is, check if the zebra at the target position spits back to position `a`.\n   - If both conditions are satisfied, print \"YES\" and exit.\n5.
