INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a number of zebras in a jungle, each positioned at a unique location. Each zebra can spit a certain distance either to the left or right. We need to determine if there are any two zebras that have spitted at each other. This means if a zebra at position `a` spits a distance `b`, it will hit another zebra at position `a + b`. We need to check if there exists a pair of zebras such that they spit at each other.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each zebra, calculate the position it can hit when it spits.
2. Check if there is another zebra at that position.
3. If a zebra at position `a` spits and hits a zebra at position `a + b`, check if the zebra at `a + b` spits back to position `a`.
4. If such a pair is found, output "YES". If no such pair exists after checking all zebras, output "NO".

## Pseudocode

1. Read the number of zebras `t`.
2. Initialize a dictionary to store the position and spit distance of each zebra.
3. For each zebra, store its position and spit distance in the dictionary.
4. For each zebra at position `a` with spit distance `b`:
   - Calculate the target position `a + b`.
   - Check if there is a zebra at the target position.
   - If there is, check if the zebra at the target position spits back to position `a`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, print "YES" and exit.
5. If no such pair is found, print "NO".

## Python Solution

```python
def check_zebras_spitting():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    zebras = {}
    
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        zebras[a] = b
        index += 2
    
    for a, b in zebras.items():
        target_position = a + b
        if target_position in zebras:
            if zebras[target_position] == -b:
                print("YES")
                return
    
    print("NO")
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first read all input data and parse it into a list of integers.
- We store each zebra's position and spit distance in a dictionary called `zebras`.
- We iterate over each zebra's position and calculate where it spits to.
- We check if there is another zebra at the calculated position and if it spits back to the original zebra's position.
- If such a pair is found, we print "YES" and exit the function.
- If no such pair is found after checking all zebras, we print "NO".

        ## Problem Restatement

        We need to determine how many times all first-year, second-year, and third-year students are present on campus simultaneously over a period of `n` days. Each group of students arrives on campus at regular intervals: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on the same day within the given period.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the number of times all three groups of students are on campus at the same time over `n` days. This happens when the time is a common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

        2. **Mathematical Insight**: The times when all three groups are present are the multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of `x`, `y`, and `z`. Therefore, we need to calculate the LCM of these three numbers.

        3. **Counting Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times it fits into the total hours over `n` days (i.e., `n * 24` hours).

        4. **Iterate for Each Test Case**: For each test case, compute the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z`, and then calculate how many times this LCM fits into the total hours.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function gcd(a, b):
            while b is not 0:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a

        function lcm(a, b):
            return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

        function lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

        function calculate_audience_times(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, x, y, z = test_case
                total_hours = N * 24
                lcm_xyz = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
                audience_times = total_hours // lcm_xyz
                results.append(audience_times)
            return results

        # Read input
        T = read integer
        test_cases = []
        for i from 1 to T:
            N = read integer
            x, y, z = read three integers
            test_cases.append((N, x, y, z))

        # Calculate results
        results = calculate_audience_times(T, test_cases)

        # Output results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def gcd(a, b):
            while b != 0:
                a, b = b, a % b

INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there are two zebras in a jungle that have spitted at each other. Each zebra is positioned at a certain point and spits a certain distance either to the left or right. If a zebra at position `a` spits `b` meters, it can hit another zebra at position `a + b`. We need to check if there exists a pair of zebras such that they have spitted at each other.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a list of zebras, each with a position and a spit distance. We need to check if there are two zebras such that one spits and hits the other, and vice versa.

2. **Data Structure**: Use a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it can hit. This will allow us to quickly check if a zebra can hit another zebra.

3. **Check for Mutual Spitting**: For each zebra, calculate the position it can hit. Check if there is another zebra at that position that can also hit back the original zebra.

4. **Output**: If such a pair is found, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".

## Pseudocode

```
function can_zebras_spit_at_each_other(t, zebras):
    # Create a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it can hit
    spit_map = {}
    
    # Populate the spit_map
    for each zebra in zebras:
        position, distance = zebra
        spit_position = position + distance
        spit_map[position] = spit_position
    
    # Check for mutual spitting
    for position, spit_position in spit_map.items():
        if spit_position in spit_map and spit_map[spit_position] == position:
            return "YES"
    
    return "NO"

# Read input
t = read integer
zebras = []
for i from 1 to t:
    a, b = read two integers
    zebras.append((a, b))

# Determine if any zebras spit at each other
result = can_zebras_spit_at_each_other(t, zebras)

# Output result
print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def can_zebras_spit_at_each_other(t, zebras):
    # Create a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it can hit
    spit_map = {}
    
    # Populate the spit_map
    for zebra in zebras:
        position, distance = zebra
        spit_position = position + distance
        spit_map[position] = spit_position
    
    # Check for mutual spitting
    for position, spit_position in spit_map.items():
        if spit_position in spit_map and spit_map[spit_position] == position:
            return "YES"

        index += 2
    
    result = can_zebras_spit_at_each_other(t, zebras)
    print(result)

This solution reads the input, processes the positions and spit distances of the zebras, and checks if any two zebras can spit at each other. If such a pair is found, it outputs "YES", otherwise "NO".

INFO - [Task id] 689 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there are two zebras in a jungle that have spitted at each other. Each zebra is positioned at a certain point and spits a certain distance either to the left or right. If a zebra at position `a` spits `b` meters, it can hit another zebra at position `a + b`. We need to check if there exists a pair of zebras such that they have spitted at each other.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a list of zebras, each with a position and a spit distance. We need to check if there are two zebras such that one spits and hits the other, and vice versa.

2. **Data Structure**: Use a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it can hit. This will allow us to quickly check if a zebra can hit another zebra.

3. **Check for Mutual Spitting**: For each zebra, calculate the position it can hit. Check if there is another zebra at that position that can also hit back the original zebra.

4. **Output**: If such a pair is found, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".

## Pseudocode

```
function can_zebras_spit_at_each_other(t, zebras):
    # Create a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it can hit
    spit_map = {}
    
    # Populate the spit_map
    for each zebra in zebras:
        position, distance = zebra
        spit_position = position + distance
        spit_map[position] = spit_position
    
    # Check for mutual spitting
    for position, spit_position in spit_map.items():
        if spit_position in spit_map and spit_map[spit_position] == position:
            return "YES"
    
    return "NO"

# Read input
t = read integer
zebras = []
for i from 1 to t:
    a, b = read two integers
    zebras.append((a, b))

# Determine if any zebras spit at each other
result = can_zebras_spit_at_each_other(t, zebras)

# Output result
print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

        if spit_position in spit_map and spit_map[spit_position] == position:

INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine if any two zebras in a jungle could spit at each other. Each zebra has a position and a spit distance, and the challenge was to check if there exists a pair of zebras such that one can spit and hit the other, and vice versa.

### Core Concepts:
- **Mapping Positions**: The key was to map each zebra's position to the position it can hit using a dictionary. This allowed for efficient lookups to determine if a zebra can hit another zebra.
- **Mutual Spitting Check**: For each zebra, calculate the position it can hit and check if there is another zebra at that position that can also hit back the original zebra.

### Strategy:
- Use a dictionary to store the mapping of each zebra's position to the position it can hit.
- Iterate through each zebra and check if the position it can hit is occupied by another zebra that can also hit back.

### Code Snippet:
```python
def can_zebras_spit_at_each_other(t, zebras):
    spit_map = {}
    for zebra in zebras:
        position, distance = zebra
        spit_position = position + distance
        spit_map[position] = spit_position
    
    for position, spit_position in spit_map.items():
        if spit_position in spit_map and spit_map[spit_position] == position:
            return "YES"
    
    return "NO"
```

### Outcome:
The solution was effective and passed all test cases. The approach of using a dictionary for quick lookups was crucial in efficiently solving the problem. This problem reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structure for efficient problem-solving.

INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine if there are two zebras that spit at each other. My approach and the official solution both utilized a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it can hit. This allows for efficient checking of mutual spitting.

Key insights from the official solution:
- The official solution uses a simple loop to populate the dictionary and then checks for mutual spitting in a straightforward manner. It uses a single loop to populate the dictionary and another loop to check for the condition, which is efficient given the constraints.
- The solution uses a flag (`a`) to determine if a mutual spitting pair is found, which is a simple and effective way to handle the output condition.

The official solution is concise and effective, and it aligns closely with my approach. Both solutions have similar time complexity, as they both involve iterating over the list of zebras twice (once to populate the dictionary and once to check for mutual spitting). The key takeaway is the use of a dictionary to efficiently map and check positions, which is crucial for solving this problem within the given constraints.

This problem specifically deals with determining if two zebras can spit at each other based on their positions and the distance they can spit, which is a classic example of checking bidirectional interactions. This concept can be applied to any situation where entities have a range of influence and you need to check for mutual influence or interaction.",

[description for function: main]
The function reads input data from standard input, which includes the number of zebras and their respective positions and spitting distances, and stores this information in a list of tuples. It then calls another function to determine if any two zebras can spit a...,
