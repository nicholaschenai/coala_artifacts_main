INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given quote is "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy". A quote is considered "Real Fancy" if it contains the word "not" as a standalone word. If "not" is not present as a standalone word, the quote is "regularly fancy". We will be given multiple quotes to evaluate.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each quote, we need to check if the word "not" appears as a standalone word.
2. A standalone word means it is surrounded by spaces or is at the beginning or end of the string.
3. We will split each quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words.
4. If "not" is found, the quote is "Real Fancy". Otherwise, it is "regularly fancy".

## Pseudocode

```
function classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for each quote in quotes:
        split the quote into words
        if "not" is in the list of words:
            print "Real Fancy"
        else:
            print "regularly fancy"

read T from input
initialize an empty list for quotes
for i from 1 to T:
    read a quote and append to quotes list

call classify_quotes with T and quotes
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate over each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is a standalone word in the list
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
# Initialize a list to store the quotes
quotes = []
# Read each quote
for _ in range(T):
    quote = input().strip()
    quotes.append(quote)

# Classify each quote
classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and each quote, then checks if "not" is a standalone word in each quote. It prints "Real Fancy" if "not" is found, otherwise "regularly fancy".

Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept revolves around game theory and understanding winning and losing positions based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the integer \( N \). The key insight is that if you can leave your opponent with a disadvantageous position, you can secure a win.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Parity Analysis**: 
       - If \( N = 1 \), the player loses immediately because no moves are possible.
       - If \( N \) is even, the player can always make it odd for the opponent, which is disadvantageous for them.
       - If \( N \) is odd, the player can either subtract 1 or divide by an odd divisor, but the goal is to leave the opponent with an even number.

    2. **Winning Strategy**:
       - Always aim to leave the opponent with an odd number if possible, as it limits their options.
       - For even numbers, you can always win by making it odd for the opponent.

    ### Solution Approach:
    - For each test case, check the value of \( N \):
      - If \( N = 1 \), the Grinch wins.
      - If \( N \) is even, you win.
      - If \( N \) is odd, you also win because you can manipulate the number to eventually leave the Grinch with an even number.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def determine_winner(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            if N == 1:
                results.append("Grinch")
            elif N % 2 == 0:
                results.append("Me")
            else:
                results.append("Me")
        for result in results:
            print(result)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of analyzing the structure of a game to determine winning and losing positions, especially using parity as a strategic tool.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it does not handle input and output correctly for a competitive programming environment. The function `classify_quotes` is defined but not called, and the input is not read from standard input. In competitive programming, the input is typically read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output.

## Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Read Input from Standard Input**: Use `input()` to read the number of test cases and the quotes.
2. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
3. **Output to Standard Output**: Ensure that the results are printed directly to standard output.

## Revised Solution

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate over each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            # If "not" is found, classify as "Real Fancy"
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            # If "not" is not found, classify as "regularly fancy"
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
# Read each quote and store in a list
quotes = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
# Call the function with the number of test cases and the list of quotes
classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

### Explanation

- **Reading Input**: We first read the number of test cases `T` using `input()`. Then, we read each quote in a loop and store them in a list called `quotes`.
- **Function Call**: We call the `classify_quotes` function with `T` and `quotes` as arguments.
- **Output**: The function processes each quote and prints the result directly to standard output. 

This solution ensures that the input is read and processed correctly, and the output is printed as expected.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
"I don't have any fancy quotes." - vijju123
Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
You are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 50$
- $1 \le |S| \le 100$
- each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to classify quotes based on whether they contain the word "not" as a standalone word. If a quote contains the word "not", it is considered "Real Fancy". Otherwise, it is "regularly fancy". We will be given multiple quotes, and for each quote, we need to determine its classification.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each quote, split the quote into individual words.
2. Check if the word "not" is present in the list of words.
3. If "not" is present, classify the quote as "Real Fancy".
4. If "not" is not present, classify the quote as "regularly fancy".

## Pseudocode

```
function classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for each quote in quotes:
        split the quote into words
        if "not" is in the list of words:
            print "Real Fancy"
        else:
            print "regularly fancy"
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate over each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            # If "not" is found, classify as "Real Fancy"
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            # If "not" is not found, classify as "regularly fancy"
            print("regularly fancy")

# Example usage:
# T = number of test cases
# quotes = list of quotes
# classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and the quotes, splits each quote into words, checks for the presence of the word "not", and prints the appropriate classification for each quote.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it does not handle input and output correctly for a competitive programming environment. The function `classify_quotes` is defined but not called, and the input is not read from standard input. In competitive programming, the input is typically read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output.

## Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Read Input from Standard Input**: Use `input()` to read the number of test cases and the quotes.
2. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
3. **Output to Standard Output**: Ensure that the results are printed directly to standard output.

## Revised Solution

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate over each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            # If "not" is found, classify as "Real Fancy"
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            # If "not" is not found, classify as "regularly fancy"
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
# Read each quote and store in a list
quotes = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
# Call the function with the number of test cases and the list of quotes
classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

### Explanation

- **Reading Input**: We first read the number of test cases `T` using `input()`. Then, we read each quote in a loop and store them in a list called `quotes`.
- **Function Call**: We call the `classify_quotes` function with `T` and `quotes` as arguments.
- **Output**: The function processes each quote and prints the result directly to standard output. 

This solution ensures that the input is read and processed correctly, and the output is printed as expected.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to identify potential killers in a mafia organization based on a hierarchical reporting structure. The key concept was to find members who are not reported to by anyone, as these are the potential killers. The problem tested the ability to process input data, use sets for efficient membership checking, and handle input/output in a competitive programming context.

    Initially, the solution correctly identified potential killers by iterating through the list of reports and using a set to track members who are reported to. However, the solution failed to pass tests because it did not handle input and output correctly. The function was defined but not called with actual input, and the results were not printed to standard output.

    The fix involved reading input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`, parsing the input data, and then calling the function with this data. The output was then printed as a space-separated string of integers. This adjustment ensured the solution worked in an automated testing environment.

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly handling input and output in programming contests and similar environments. It also reinforced the utility of sets for efficient membership checking when dealing with problems involving unique elements.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not" as a standalone word. The core concept was to split each quote into words and check for the presence of "not". If found, the quote is classified as "Real Fancy"; otherwise, it is "regularly fancy".

Initially, the solution was structured as a function that wasn't called, and input/output handling was not aligned with competitive programming standards. The key learning was the importance of reading input from standard input and printing output directly to standard output, which is typical in such environments.

The successful strategy involved:
1. Reading the number of test cases and the quotes using `input()`.
2. Splitting each quote into words and checking for the word "not".
3. Printing the appropriate classification for each quote.

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding input/output requirements in competitive programming and ensuring that functions are properly invoked. The solution was straightforward once these aspects were correctly implemented.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to classify quotes based on whether they contain the word "not" as a standalone word. If a quote contains the word "not", it is considered "Real Fancy". Otherwise, it is "regularly fancy". We will be given multiple quotes, and for each quote, we need to determine its classification.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each quote, split the quote into individual words.
2. Check if the word "not" is present in the list of words.
3. If "not" is present, classify the quote as "Real Fancy".
4. If "not" is not present, classify the quote as "regularly fancy".

## Pseudocode

```
function classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for each quote in quotes:
        split the quote into words
        if "not" is in the list of words:
            print "Real Fancy"
        else:
            print "regularly fancy"
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate over each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            # If "not" is found, classify as "Real Fancy"
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            # If "not" is not found, classify as "regularly fancy"
            print("regularly fancy")

# Example usage:
# T = number of test cases
# quotes = list of quotes
# classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and the quotes, splits each quote into words, checks for the presence of the word "not", and prints the appropriate classification for each quote.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it does not handle input and output correctly for a competitive programming environment. The function `classify_quotes` is defined but not called, and the input is not read from standard input. In competitive programming, the input is typically read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output.

## Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Read Input from Standard Input**: Use `input()` to read the number of test cases and the quotes.
2. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
3. **Output to Standard Output**: Ensure that the results are printed directly to standard output.

## Revised Solution

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate over each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            # If "not" is found, classify as "Real Fancy"
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            # If "not" is not found, classify as "regularly fancy"
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
# Read each quote and store in a list
quotes = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
# Call the function with the number of test cases and the list of quotes
classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

### Explanation

- **Reading Input**: We first read the number of test cases `T` using `input()`. Then, we read each quote in a loop and store them in a list called `quotes`.
- **Function Call**: We call the `classify_quotes` function with `T` and `quotes` as arguments.
- **Output**: The function processes each quote and prints the result directly to standard output. 

This solution ensures that the input is read and processed correctly, and the output is printed as expected.

classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

### Explanation

- **Reading Input**: The number of test cases `T` is read first. Then, each quote is read in a loop and stored in a list called `quotes`.
- **Function Call**: The `classify_quotes` function is called with `T` and `quotes` as arguments.
- **Output**: The function processes each quote and prints "Real Fancy" if the word "not" is present as a standalone word, otherwise it prints "regularly fancy".

 s=list(input().split(' '))
 if("not" in s):
  print("Real Fancy")
 else:
  print("regularly fancy")
 t=t-1

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this exercise, the problem was straightforward, and the solution I provided was quite similar to the official solution. Both solutions involved splitting the input quote into words and checking for the presence of the word "not" to determine if the quote is "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy". 

The key insight from this problem is the importance of handling input and output correctly in a competitive programming context. Initially, my solution did not execute because I had encapsulated the logic within a function without calling it, which is a common mistake when transitioning from writing standalone scripts to competitive programming solutions.

The official solution uses a `while` loop to process each test case, which is a slightly different approach compared to my use of a `for` loop. Both methods are valid, but the `while` loop is more traditional in competitive programming for iterating over test cases. Additionally, the official solution uses a list to store the split words, which is a minor difference but functionally equivalent to my approach.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the logic is executed as intended. The problem was simple, but it served as a good reminder of these fundamental practices.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the task was to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not" as a standalone word.

    "I don't have any fancy quotes." - vijju123
    Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
    You are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 50$
    - $1 \le |S| \le 100$
    - each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space
