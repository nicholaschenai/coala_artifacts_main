## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of Fibonacci numbers and need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of their last decimal digits. For each test case, we are given an integer \( N \), which represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to consider. The task is to determine the last remaining number after performing the described process.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

2. **Last Decimal Digit**: For each Fibonacci number, we are interested in its last decimal digit, which is the number modulo 10.

3. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly remove all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last decimal digits until only one element remains.

4. **Pattern Recognition**: The sequence of last decimal digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

5. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the periodicity, for any \( N \), we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers to determine the sequence of last digits. We can then simulate the reduction process on this sequence.

6. **Reduction Process**: For a sequence of length \( l \), the new sequence \( E \) is formed by taking every second element starting from the second element. This process is repeated until the sequence has only one element.

## Pseudocode

1. Precompute the last decimal digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. For each test case:
   - Determine the effective length \( N \% 60 \) to use the precomputed sequence.
   - Simulate the reduction process on the sequence of last digits until one element remains.
   - Output the last remaining element.

## Python Solution

```python
def last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(T, test_cases):
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    
    results = []
    for N in test_cases:
        # Find the effective length using the periodicity of 60
        effective_length = N % 60
        if effective_length == 0:
            effective_length = 60
        
        # Start with the sequence of last digits up to the effective length
        D = last_digits[:effective_length]
        
        # Reduce the sequence until one element remains
        while len(D) > 1:
            D = D[1::2]  # Take every second element starting from the second
        
        # The last remaining element
        results.append(D[0])
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# T = number of test cases
# test_cases = list of N values for each test case
# results = last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(T, test_cases)
# for result in results:
#     print(result)
```

This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, allowing us to reduce the problem size significantly and perform the reduction process quickly.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of Fibonacci numbers and need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of their last decimal digits. Specifically, for each test case, we are given an integer \( N \), and we need to compute the sequence of the last decimal digits of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers. We then repeatedly remove all odd-indexed elements until only one element remains, which is the result for that test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Last Digits**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \). We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using modulo 10.

2. **Pattern Recognition**: The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that for any \( N \), the sequence of last digits will repeat every 60 numbers.

3. **Reduction Process**: Given the periodicity, we can reduce the problem by considering only the first 60 last digits. We then simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one element remains.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each test case, determine the position within the 60-length cycle that corresponds to \( N \). Use this position to find the last remaining number after the reduction process.

### Pseudocode

1. Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. For each test case:
   - Determine the position in the 60-length cycle using \( N \% 60 \).
   - Simulate the reduction process on the sequence of last digits up to this position.
   - Output the last remaining number.

### Python Code

```python
def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):

    # Find the position in the cycle
    position = n % 60
    
    # Simulate the reduction process
    sequence = last_digits[:position]
    while len(sequence) > 1:
        sequence = sequence[1::2]  # Keep only even-indexed elements (1-based)
    
    return sequence[0]

### Explanation of the Code

- **Precomputation**: We calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers because the sequence of last digits is periodic with a cycle length of 60.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of Fibonacci numbers and need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of their last decimal digits. Specifically, for each test case, we are given an integer \( N \), and we need to compute the sequence of the last decimal digits of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers. We then repeatedly remove all odd-indexed elements until only one element remains, which is the result for that test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Last Digits**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \). We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using modulo 10.

2. **Pattern Recognition**: The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that for any \( N \), the sequence of last digits will repeat every 60 numbers.

3. **Reduction Process**: Given the periodicity, we can reduce the problem by considering only the first 60 last digits. We then simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one element remains.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each test case, determine the position within the 60-length cycle that corresponds to \( N \). Use this position to find the last remaining number after the reduction process.

### Pseudocode

1. Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. For each test case:
   - Determine the position in the 60-length cycle using \( N \% 60 \).
   - Simulate the reduction process on the sequence of last digits up to this position.
   - Output the last remaining number.

### Python Code

```python
def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    
    # Find the position in the cycle
    position = n % 60
    
    # Simulate the reduction process
    sequence = last_digits[:position]
    while len(sequence) > 1:
        sequence = sequence[1::2]  # Keep only even-indexed elements (1-based)
    
    return sequence[0]

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = last_digit_of_fibonacci(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Precomputation**: We calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers because the sequence of last digits is periodic with a cycle length of 60.
- **Position Calculation**: For each test case, we determine the position in the cycle using \( N \% 60 \).
- **Reduction Simulation**: We simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.
- **Output**: We print the last remaining number for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue seems to be related to the way the code is structured, particularly with the input and output handling. The function `solve()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads input and produces output is never executed. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that rely on standard input and output.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the results are stored in a list. Each result is then printed in sequence.

3. **Output Handling**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    
    # Find the position in the cycle
    position = n % 60
    
    # Simulate the reduction process
    sequence = last_digits[:position]
    while len(sequence) > 1:
        sequence = sequence[1::2]  # Keep only even-indexed elements (1-based)
    
    return sequence[0]

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = last_digit_of_fibonacci(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Call the solve function to execute the solution
solve()
```

### Explanation of Corrections

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.
- **Input and Output**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, and the results are stored in a list. Each result is printed in sequence after processing all test cases.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now executed properly.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of Fibonacci numbers and need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of their last decimal digits. Specifically, for each test case, we are given an integer \( N \), and we need to compute the sequence of the last decimal digits of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers. We then repeatedly remove all odd-indexed elements until only one element remains, which is the result for that test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Last Digits**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \). We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using modulo 10.

2. **Pattern Recognition**: The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that for any \( N \), the sequence of last digits will repeat every 60 numbers.

3. **Reduction Process**: Given the periodicity, we can reduce the problem by considering only the first 60 last digits. We then simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one element remains.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each test case, determine the position within the 60-length cycle that corresponds to \( N \). Use this position to find the last remaining number after the reduction process.

### Pseudocode

1. Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. For each test case:
   - Determine the position in the 60-length cycle using \( N \% 60 \).
   - Simulate the reduction process on the sequence of last digits up to this position.
   - Output the last remaining number.

### Python Code

```python
def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    
    # Find the position in the cycle
    position = n % 60
    
    # Simulate the reduction process
    sequence = last_digits[:position]
    while len(sequence) > 1:
        sequence = sequence[1::2]  # Keep only even-indexed elements (1-based)
    
    return sequence[0]

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = last_digit_of_fibonacci(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Precomputation**: We calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers because the sequence of last digits is periodic with a cycle length of 60.
- **Position Calculation**: For each test case, we determine the position in the cycle using \( N \% 60 \).
- **Reduction Simulation**: We simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.
- **Output**: We print the last remaining number for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue seems to be related to the way the code is structured, particularly with the input and output handling. The function `solve()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads input and produces output is never executed. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that rely on standard input and output.

### Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the results are stored in a list. Each result is then printed in sequence.

3. **Output Handling**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):

        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Call the solve function to execute the solution

```

### Explanation of Corrections

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.
- **Input and Output**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, and the results are stored in a list. Each result is printed in sequence after processing all test cases.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now executed properly.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] In this problem, the key insight was recognizing the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, which repeat every 60 numbers. This allowed us to reduce the problem significantly by only considering the first 60 Fibonacci numbers' last digits. The main challenge was efficiently simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

Initially, the code failed because the function responsible for reading input and producing output was not called. This was a simple oversight but highlighted the importance of ensuring that all parts of the code are executed as intended, especially in competitive programming or environments where input/output is handled through standard streams.

The solution involved precomputing the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers, determining the position within this cycle for each test case, and then simulating the reduction process. The corrected code included a call to the `solve()` function, ensuring that the input is processed and results are printed.

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints (like periodicity) to optimize solutions and the necessity of verifying that all parts of a solution are executed, especially in environments with specific input/output requirements.

- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
import math

t = int(input())

a = [-1, 0, 1]

for i in range(58):
 temp = a[-1] + a[-2]
 temp = temp%10
 a.append(temp)
 
for _ in range(t):
 n = int(input())
 
 temp = len(bin(n)) - 3
 temp = 2**temp
 temp = temp%60
 
 print(a[temp])

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, there are several key insights and takeaways:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves the Fibonacci sequence and its periodicity in terms of last digits. Recognizing that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a cycle length of 60 was crucial. This insight allowed us to reduce the problem size significantly, as we only needed to consider the first 60 numbers.

2. **Efficient Calculation**: The official solution leverages the binary representation of \( N \) to determine the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( N \). This is a clever way to simulate the process of repeatedly halving the sequence until one element remains. The use of bit manipulation (specifically, the length of the binary representation) is an efficient way to achieve this.

3. **Modulo Operation**: Both solutions use the modulo operation to handle the periodicity of the sequence. This is a common technique in problems involving cycles or periodic sequences.

4. **Input and Output Handling**: The initial issue with my solution was related to not calling the function that processes input and output. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main function is executed, especially in competitive programming environments where input and output are handled through standard streams.

Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of bit manipulation to efficiently determine the position in the cycle, which is a technique that can be applied to other problems involving powers of two or similar halving processes.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] The function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases, followed by T integers. For each integer N, it calculates the last digit of the N-th Fibonacci number using a precomputed cycle of the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers. It then reduces the sequence of last digits by repeatedly keeping only the even-indexed elements until one element remains, which is the result for that test case. The function stores the results for all test cases and prints each result on a new line.

[Problem]
    The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
    Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
    - Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
    - If $l = 1$, the process ends.
    - Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
    - Change $D$ to $E$.
    When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
    - $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (20 points):
    - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
    - $1 \le N \le 10^7$
    Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

    -----Example Input-----
    1
    9

    -----Example Output-----
    3

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.
