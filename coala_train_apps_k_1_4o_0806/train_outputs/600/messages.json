For each test case, we are given an integer \\( N \\), which represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to consider. The task is to determine the last remaining number after performing the described process.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \\( F_0 = 0 \\), \\( F_1 = 1 \\), and \\( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Last Decimal Digit**: For each Fibonacci number, we are interested in its last decimal digit, which is the number modulo 10.\n\n3. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly remove all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last decimal digits until only one element remains.\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition**: The sequence of last decimal digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.\n\n5. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the periodicity, for any \\( N \\), we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers to determine the sequence of last digits. We can then simulate the reduction process on this sequence.\n\n6. **Reduction Process**: For a sequence of length \\( l \\), the new sequence \\( E \\) is formed by taking every second element starting from the second element. This process is repeated until the sequence has only one element.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Precompute the last decimal digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.\n2.

The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.\n\n    #### Key Insights and Strategies\n\n    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.\n\n    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N = test_case[0]\n            A = test_case[1]\n        \n            current_sum = 0\n            possible = True\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                current_sum += A[i]\n                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n        \n            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The problem demonstrates how to leverage the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers to reduce computational complexity, which is crucial when dealing with very large inputs (up to 10^18 in this case). This approach can be applied to other problems involving periodic sequences or when a reduction process is needed to find a single element from a large sequence. It is also useful in competitive programming and algorithm design, where optimizing for time and space complexity is essential."
