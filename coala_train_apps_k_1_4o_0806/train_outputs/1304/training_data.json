    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was generating the next permutation in lexicographic order. The task involved understanding how permutations can be ordered similarly to dictionary entries and finding the next sequence in this order. The key steps included identifying the first decreasing element from the end, swapping it with the smallest larger element to its right, and reversing the sequence to the right of the original position to ensure the smallest possible order.\n\nThe strategy that worked was based on a well-known algorithm for generating the next permutation. This involves:\n1. Scanning the permutation from right to left to find the first pair where the earlier element is smaller than the later one.\n2. Swapping this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger.\n3. Reversing the sequence to the right of the original position to achieve the next lexicographic order.\n\nThe implementation was straightforward, and the solution passed all tests without any issues. This problem reinforced the understanding of permutation generation and manipulation, which is a common pattern in combinatorial problems. The approach is efficient and works well within the given constraints.",
    "reflection": "The problem of finding the next permutation in lexicographic order is a classic algorithmic challenge. The official solution and my approach both implement the same fundamental algorithm, which is efficient and well-suited for this task. Here are some key insights and reflections from the exercise:\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Algorithm Understanding**:\n   - Both solutions utilize the same core algorithm to find the next permutation. This involves identifying the first pair of elements from the end where the earlier element is smaller, swapping it with the smallest larger element to its right, and then reversing the sequence to the right of the original position to achieve the next lexicographic order.\n\n2. **Efficiency**:\n   - The algorithm operates in O(N) time complexity for each permutation, where N is the length of the permutation. This is efficient given the constraints, as it processes each permutation in linear time.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The solutions handle the edge case where the permutation is the largest possible by reversing the entire sequence to return the smallest permutation.\n\n### Reflections\n\n- **Code Structure**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input, which can be useful for organizing code, especially in competitive programming settings. My solution directly processes input using `sys.stdin.read`, which is also effective but less modular.\n\n- **Implementation Details**: The official solution uses a more explicit loop to find the smallest larger element, which can be slightly more intuitive to follow. My solution uses a while loop for the same purpose, which is concise but requires careful index management.\n\n- **Learning**: This exercise reinforced the importance of understanding the underlying algorithm for generating permutations. The problem is a good example of how a well-known algorithm can be directly applied to solve a specific problem efficiently.\n\nOverall, both solutions are correct and efficient, demonstrating the robustness of the next permutation algorithm. This problem serves as a valuable exercise in implementing and understanding a classic algorithmic technique.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes two integers, N and K, followed by K permutations of N integers each. It processes each permutation to find its next lexicographical permutation using a helper function and stores the results. After processing all permutations, it prints each resulting permutation as a space-separated string.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to generate permutations in lexicographic order, such as in combinatorial problems, algorithm design, and testing. It is particularly relevant in situations where you need to find the next permutation of a sequence, which is a common task in problems involving permutations and combinations. This can be applied in generating test cases, solving puzzles, or optimizing search algorithms where permutations play a role. Understanding how to efficiently find the next permutation can also be beneficial in competitive programming and coding interviews, where such problems are frequently encountered."
