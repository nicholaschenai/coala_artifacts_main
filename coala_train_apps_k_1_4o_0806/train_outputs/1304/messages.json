However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.\nHowever, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:\n123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \\, 2 \\, 3 \\quad    1 \\, 3 \\, 2 \\quad     2 \\, 1 \\, 3 \\quad     2 \\, 3 \\, 1 \\quad     3 \\, 1 \\, 2 \\quad     3 \\, 2 \\, 1 \nThe problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, \u2026, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,\u2026,N$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$.\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 10$.\n\n-----Sample input-----\n3 2\n3 1 2\n2 3 1\n\n-----Sample output-----\n3 2 1\n3 1 2\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Our task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order for each of these `K` permutations and output them.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in the order they would appear if sorted.\n\n2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:\n   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair of consecutive elements where the earlier element is smaller than the later one. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.\n   - Swap this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger than it.\n   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position of the first element to get the smallest possible order.\n\n3. **Edge Case**: If the permutation is the last in lexicographic order (i.e., sorted in descending order), the next permutation is the first permutation (i.e., sorted in ascending order).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction next_permutation(perm):\n    n = length of perm\n    i = n - 2\n    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    if i == -1:\n        reverse perm from start to end\n        return perm\n    j = n - 1\n    while perm[j] <= perm[i]:\n        j -= 1\n    swap perm[i] and perm[j]\n    reverse perm from i + 1 to end\n    return perm\n\nread N, K\nfor each permutation in input:\n    result = next_permutation(permutation)\n    print result\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef next_permutation(perm):\n    n = len(perm)\n    i = n - 2\n    \n    # Find the first decreasing element from the end\n    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    \n    if i == -1:\n        # If no such element is found, the permutation is the last one\n        perm.reverse()\n    else:\n        # Find the smallest element larger than perm[i] to the right of i\n        j = n - 1\n        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:\n            j -= 1\n        # Swap elements at i and j\n        perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]\n        # Reverse the sequence from i+1 to end to get the next permutation\n        perm[i + 1:] = reversed(perm[i + 1:])\n    \n    return perm\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    K = int(data[1])\n    \n    index = 2\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(K):\n        permutation = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)\n        results.append(' '.join(map(str, next_perm)))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code reads input from standard input, processes each permutation to find its next lexicographic permutation, and prints the results.

However, the function `find_permutation` is defined but never called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed, leading to no output.\n\n        2. **Permutation Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the permutation is based on starting with a descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This logic seems correct in principle, but it needs to be executed to verify its correctness.\n\n        3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for whether a permutation can achieve the desired sum K is based on comparing K with the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P). This part seems logically sound.\n\n        4. **Execution**: The main issue is that the function is not being executed, which is why no output is being produced.\n\n        To fix the problem, we need to ensure that the function is called and executed properly.

This is efficient given the constraints, as it processes each permutation in linear time.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The solutions handle the edge case where the permutation is the largest possible by reversing the entire sequence to return the smallest permutation.\n\n### Reflections\n\n- **Code Structure**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input, which can be useful for organizing code, especially in competitive programming settings. My solution directly processes input using `sys.stdin.read`, which is also effective but less modular.\n\n- **Implementation Details**: The official solution uses a more explicit loop to find the smallest larger element, which can be slightly more intuitive to follow. My solution uses a while loop for the same purpose, which is concise but requires careful index management.\n\n- **Learning**: This exercise reinforced the importance of understanding the underlying algorithm for generating permutations. The problem is a good example of how a well-known algorithm can be directly applied to solve a specific problem efficiently.\n\nOverall, both solutions are correct and efficient, demonstrating the robustness of the next permutation algorithm. This problem serves as a valuable exercise in implementing and understanding a classic algorithmic technique."

It processes each permutation to find its next lexicographical permutation using a helper function and stores the results. After processing all permutations, it prints each resulting permutation as a space-separated string.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to generate permutations in lexicographic order, such as in combinatorial problems, algorithm design, and testing. It is particularly relevant in situations where you need to find the next permutation of a sequence, which is a common task in problems involving permutations and combinations. This can be applied in generating test cases, solving puzzles, or optimizing search algorithms where permutations play a role. Understanding how to efficiently find the next permutation can also be beneficial in competitive programming and coding interviews, where such problems are frequently encountered."
