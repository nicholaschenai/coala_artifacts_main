## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1
3 1 2

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a number `N` and a number `K`, followed by `K` permutations of the numbers from `1` to `N`. Our task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order for each of these `K` permutations and output them.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in the order they would appear if sorted.

2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:
   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair of consecutive elements where the earlier element is smaller than the later one. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.
   - Swap this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger than it.
   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position of the first element to get the smallest possible order.

3. **Edge Case**: If the permutation is the last in lexicographic order (i.e., sorted in descending order), the next permutation is the first permutation (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

### Pseudocode

```
function next_permutation(perm):
    n = length of perm
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i == -1:
        reverse perm from start to end
        return perm
    j = n - 1
    while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
        j -= 1
    swap perm[i] and perm[j]
    reverse perm from i + 1 to end
    return perm

read N, K
for each permutation in input:
    result = next_permutation(permutation)
    print result
```

### Python Code

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    n = len(perm)
    i = n - 2
    
    # Find the first decreasing element from the end
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    
    if i == -1:
        # If no such element is found, the permutation is the last one
        perm.reverse()
    else:
        # Find the smallest element larger than perm[i] to the right of i
        j = n - 1
        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
            j -= 1
        # Swap elements at i and j
        perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
        # Reverse the sequence from i+1 to end to get the next permutation
        perm[i + 1:] = reversed(perm[i + 1:])
    
    return perm

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    
    index = 2
    results = []
    for _ in range(K):
        permutation = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, next_perm)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads input from standard input, processes each permutation to find its next lexicographic permutation, and prints the results. The `next_permutation` function implements the logic to find the next permutation as described in the conceptual solution.

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code is designed to read from standard input and write to standard output. However, the function `find_permutation` is defined but never called. This means that the logic inside the function is never executed, leading to no output.

        2. **Permutation Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the permutation is based on starting with a descending order and adjusting it to achieve the desired sum K. This logic seems correct in principle, but it needs to be executed to verify its correctness.

        3. **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for whether a permutation can achieve the desired sum K is based on comparing K with the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P). This part seems logically sound.

        4. **Execution**: The main issue is that the function is not being executed, which is why no output is being produced.

        To fix the problem, we need to ensure that the function is called and executed properly. Let's adjust the code to ensure it runs as expected:

        ```python
        def find_permutation():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
                min_possible = (N * (N - 1) // 2)
        
                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                    current_sum = max_possible
            
                    for i in range(N - 1):
                        if current_sum == K:
                            break
                        if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]) >= K:
                            current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1])
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
            
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        # Call the function to execute the logic
        find_permutation()
        ```

        ### Key Changes:
        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the function processes it as expected.
        - **Output Handling**: The results are collected in a list and written to standard output at the end.

        This should address the issue of no output being produced and allow the code to be tested properly.

Given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N, the task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. We are provided with K permutations, and for each permutation, we need to output its next permutation in lexicographic order.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in increasing order.

2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:
   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair of consecutive elements where the earlier element is smaller than the later one. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.
   - Swap this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger than it.
   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position of the first element to get the smallest possible order.

3. **Edge Case**: If the permutation is the largest possible (i.e., in descending order), the next permutation is the smallest possible (i.e., in ascending order).

### Pseudocode

```
function next_permutation(perm):
    n = length of perm
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i >= 0:
        j = n - 1
        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
            j -= 1

    return perm

function main():
    read N and K
    for each of K permutations:
        read permutation
        print next_permutation(permutation)
```

### Final Python Solution

 ### Problem Restatement

Given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N, the task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. We are provided with K permutations, and for each permutation, we need to output its next permutation in lexicographic order.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in increasing order.

2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:
   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair of consecutive elements where the earlier element is smaller than the later one. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.
   - Swap this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger than it.
   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position of the first element to get the smallest possible order.

3. **Edge Case**: If the permutation is the largest possible (i.e., in descending order), the next permutation is the smallest possible (i.e., in ascending order).

### Pseudocode

```
function next_permutation(perm):
    n = length of perm
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i >= 0:
        j = n - 1
        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
            j -= 1
        swap perm[i] and perm[j]
    reverse perm from i + 1 to end
    return perm

function main():
    read N and K
    for each of K permutations:
        read permutation
        print next_permutation(permutation)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    n = len(perm)
    i = n - 2
    # Find the first decreasing element from the end
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:

        # Find the element just larger than perm[i]
        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
            j -= 1
        # Swap them
        perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
    # Reverse the sequence from i+1 to end
    perm[i + 1:] = reversed(perm[i + 1:])
    return perm

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was generating the next permutation in lexicographic order. The task involved understanding how permutations can be ordered similarly to dictionary entries and finding the next sequence in this order. The key steps included identifying the first decreasing element from the end, swapping it with the smallest larger element to its right, and reversing the sequence to the right of the original position to ensure the smallest possible order.

The strategy that worked was based on a well-known algorithm for generating the next permutation. This involves:
1. Scanning the permutation from right to left to find the first pair where the earlier element is smaller than the later one.
2. Swapping this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger.
3. Reversing the sequence to the right of the original position to achieve the next lexicographic order.

The implementation was straightforward, and the solution passed all tests without any issues. This problem reinforced the understanding of permutation generation and manipulation, which is a common pattern in combinatorial problems. The approach is efficient and works well within the given constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] The problem of finding the next permutation in lexicographic order is a classic algorithmic challenge. The official solution and my approach both implement the same fundamental algorithm, which is efficient and well-suited for this task. Here are some key insights and reflections from the exercise:

### Key Insights

1. **Algorithm Understanding**:
   - Both solutions utilize the same core algorithm to find the next permutation. This involves identifying the first pair of elements from the end where the earlier element is smaller, swapping it with the smallest larger element to its right, and then reversing the sequence to the right of the original position to achieve the next lexicographic order.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - The algorithm operates in O(N) time complexity for each permutation, where N is the length of the permutation. This is efficient given the constraints, as it processes each permutation in linear time.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solutions handle the edge case where the permutation is the largest possible by reversing the entire sequence to return the smallest permutation.

### Reflections

- **Code Structure**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input, which can be useful for organizing code, especially in competitive programming settings. My solution directly processes input using `sys.stdin.read`, which is also effective but less modular.

- **Implementation Details**: The official solution uses a more explicit loop to find the smallest larger element, which can be slightly more intuitive to follow. My solution uses a while loop for the same purpose, which is concise but requires careful index management.

- **Learning**: This exercise reinforced the importance of understanding the underlying algorithm for generating permutations. The problem is a good example of how a well-known algorithm can be directly applied to solve a specific problem efficiently.

Overall, both solutions are correct and efficient, demonstrating the robustness of the next permutation algorithm. This problem serves as a valuable exercise in implementing and understanding a classic algorithmic technique.

[Problem]
    It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
    However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
    123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
    The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

    -----Output:-----
    The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
    - $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

    -----Sample input-----
    3 2
    3 1 2
    2 3 1

    -----Sample output-----
    3 2 1
    3 1 2
