## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Â             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Â             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
Â             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:


Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a list where each element represents the price of a stock on a given day. We need to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying and then selling the stock. We cannot hold more than one stock at a time, meaning we must sell the stock before buying again.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to consider the possibility of making up to two transactions. We can break down the problem into two parts:
   
   - Calculate the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction up to each day.
   - Calculate the maximum profit we can achieve with a second transaction starting from each day to the end.
   
   By combining these two parts, we can determine the maximum profit achievable with at most two transactions.

   We can use dynamic programming to keep track of these profits:
   
   - Use an array `left_profits` where `left_profits[i]` stores the maximum profit achievable from day 0 to day i with one transaction.
   - Use an array `right_profits` where `right_profits[i]` stores the maximum profit achievable from day i to the last day with one transaction.
   
   Finally, iterate through each day and calculate the total profit by summing `left_profits[i]` and `right_profits[i]`, and keep track of the maximum sum.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   If prices list is empty, return 0
   
   Initialize left_profits and right_profits arrays with zeros, same length as prices
   
   Initialize min_price to the first price
   For each day i from 1 to end:
       Update min_price to be the minimum of min_price and prices[i]
       Update left_profits[i] to be the maximum of left_profits[i-1] and prices[i] - min_price
   
   Initialize max_price to the last price
   For each day i from second last to start:
       Update max_price to be the maximum of max_price and prices[i]
       Update right_profits[i] to be the maximum of right_profits[i+1] and max_price - prices[i]
   
   Initialize max_profit to 0
   For each day i:
       Update max_profit to be the maximum of max_profit and left_profits[i] + right_profits[i]
   
   Return max_profit
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # If the prices list is empty, return 0 as no transactions can be made
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        n = len(prices)
        
        # Initialize arrays to store maximum profits for left and right transactions
        left_profits = [0] * n
        right_profits = [0] * n
        
        # Calculate maximum profit for one transaction from the left (start to each day)
        min_price = prices[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
            left_profits[i] = max(left_profits[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)
        
        # Calculate maximum profit for one transaction from the right (each day to end)
        max_price = prices[-1]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
            right_profits[i] = max(right_profits[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])
        
        # Calculate the maximum profit by combining left and right profits
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(n):
            max_profit = max(max_profit, left_profits[i] + right_profits[i])
        
        return max_profit
```

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit possible with at most two transactions by using dynamic programming to track potential profits from both directions (left to right and right to left).

    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:

    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution

    1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve the problem. This is a powerful technique for problems involving optimal subsequences or subarrays, as it allows us to build solutions incrementally and efficiently.

    2. **State Representation**: The DP table `dp[i][0]` and `dp[i][1]` are used to represent the maximum alternating sum up to the `i-th` element, where:
       - `dp[i][0]` is the maximum sum if the `i-th` element is added.
       - `dp[i][1]` is the maximum sum if the `i-th` element is subtracted.

    3. **Transition Logic**: The transitions are defined as:
       - `dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] + a)`: This means we either continue the previous sequence without adding the current element or add the current element to the sequence where the previous element was subtracted.
       - `dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] - a)`: This means we either continue the previous sequence without subtracting the current element or subtract the current element from the sequence where the previous element was added.

    4. **Efficiency**: The DP approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

    ### Reflection on My Approach

    - **Initial Misunderstanding**: My initial attempts failed because I misunderstood the problem's requirement to maximize the alternating sum. I incorrectly assumed a simple alternating pattern based on indices would suffice, which led to incorrect results.
  
    - **Learning from Mistakes**: The official solution highlights the importance of considering all possible subsequences and using a systematic approach like dynamic programming to explore these possibilities efficiently.

    - **Future Application**: This experience reinforces the value of dynamic programming for problems involving optimal subsequences. It also emphasizes the need to carefully analyze problem constraints and requirements before deciding on a solution strategy.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the maximum profit from at most two stock transactions given a list of daily prices. The key concept here is dynamic programming, where we track the minimum prices and maximum profits for up to two transactions as we iterate through the list of prices.

The approach involves maintaining four variables: `first_buy`, `first_profit`, `second_buy`, and `second_profit`. These variables help in calculating the minimum cost for buying and the maximum profit for selling in two separate transactions. The algorithm efficiently updates these variables in a single pass through the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

This problem reinforces the importance of understanding dynamic programming and how to manage state across iterations to solve complex problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. The strategy of updating the buy and profit variables based on the current price and previous states proved effective. This pattern can be useful for similar problems involving multiple transactions or stages.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Â             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Â             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
Â             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:


Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a list where each element represents the price of a stock on a particular day. We need to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two buy-and-sell transactions. We cannot hold more than one stock at a time, meaning we must sell the stock before buying again.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain two arrays to track the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction and two transactions up to each day. The idea is to iterate through the list of prices and update these arrays based on whether we buy or sell on a given day. We will keep track of the minimum price seen so far to calculate the profit for the first transaction and use the profit from the first transaction to calculate the potential profit for the second transaction.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize first_buy to a large number (infinity)
   Initialize first_profit to 0
   Initialize second_buy to a large number (infinity)
   Initialize second_profit to 0

   For each price in prices:
       Update first_buy to be the minimum of first_buy and the current price
       Update first_profit to be the maximum of first_profit and the current price minus first_buy
       Update second_buy to be the minimum of second_buy and the current price minus first_profit
       Update second_profit to be the maximum of second_profit and the current price minus second_buy

   Return second_profit
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize variables to track the minimum prices and maximum profits
        first_buy = float('inf')  # Minimum price for the first buy
        first_profit = 0          # Maximum profit after the first sell
        second_buy = float('inf') # Minimum price for the second buy considering the first profit
        second_profit = 0         # Maximum profit after the second sell

        # Iterate over each price in the list
        for price in prices:
            # Update the minimum price for the first buy
            first_buy = min(first_buy, price)
            # Update the maximum profit after the first sell
            first_profit = max(first_profit, price - first_buy)
            # Update the minimum price for the second buy considering the first profit
            second_buy = min(second_buy, price - first_profit)
            # Update the maximum profit after the second sell
            second_profit = max(second_profit, price - second_buy)

        # Return the maximum profit after two transactions
        return second_profit
```

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit with at most two transactions by iterating through the prices once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III" problem, I found that both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the problem, but they approach it differently.

### Key Insights:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - My solution uses a dynamic programming approach with two transactions, maintaining variables to track the minimum prices and maximum profits for each transaction. This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a few variables.

2. **Official Solution's Approach:**
   - The official solution also uses a dynamic programming approach but with a different strategy. It calculates the maximum profit from the right side of the array to the left (`rmax_profits`) and then combines it with the maximum profit from the left side to the right. This approach uses additional space to store the maximum profits for each day, resulting in a space complexity of O(n).

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both solutions are efficient in terms of time complexity, but my solution is more space-efficient. The official solution provides a clear breakdown of profits from both directions, which can be insightful for understanding how profits accumulate over time.

### Conclusion:

The problem was a good exercise in applying dynamic programming to optimize stock trading strategies. The official solution's use of arrays to track profits from both directions is a useful technique for problems where multiple passes over the data can provide additional insights. However, for this specific problem, my approach is more space-efficient while maintaining the same time complexity.
