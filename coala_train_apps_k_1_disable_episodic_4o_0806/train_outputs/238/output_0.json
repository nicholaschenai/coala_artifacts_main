    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a list where each element represents the price of a stock on a particular day. We need to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two buy-and-sell transactions. We cannot hold more than one stock at a time, meaning we must sell the stock before buying again.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain two arrays to track the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction and two transactions up to each day. The idea is to iterate through the list of prices and update these arrays based on whether we buy or sell on a given day. We will keep track of the minimum price seen so far to calculate the profit for the first transaction and use the profit from the first transaction to calculate the potential profit for the second transaction.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize first_buy to a large number (infinity)\n   Initialize first_profit to 0\n   Initialize second_buy to a large number (infinity)\n   Initialize second_profit to 0\n\n   For each price in prices:\n       Update first_buy to be the minimum of first_buy and the current price\n       Update first_profit to be the maximum of first_profit and the current price minus first_buy\n       Update second_buy to be the minimum of second_buy and the current price minus first_profit\n       Update second_profit to be the maximum of second_profit and the current price minus second_buy\n\n   Return second_profit\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize variables to track the minimum prices and maximum profits\n        first_buy = float('inf')  # Minimum price for the first buy\n        first_profit = 0          # Maximum profit after the first sell\n        second_buy = float('inf') # Minimum price for the second buy considering the first profit\n        second_profit = 0         # Maximum profit after the second sell\n\n        # Iterate over each price in the list\n        for price in prices:\n            # Update the minimum price for the first buy\n            first_buy = min(first_buy, price)\n            # Update the maximum profit after the first sell\n            first_profit = max(first_profit, price - first_buy)\n            # Update the minimum price for the second buy considering the first profit\n            second_buy = min(second_buy, price - first_profit)\n            # Update the maximum profit after the second sell\n            second_profit = max(second_profit, price - second_buy)\n\n        # Return the maximum profit after two transactions\n        return second_profit\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit with at most two transactions by iterating through the prices once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).",
