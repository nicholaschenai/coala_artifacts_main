## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1
3 1 2

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a number `N` and a number `K`, followed by `K` permutations of the numbers from `1` to `N`. Our task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order for each of these `K` permutations and output them.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in the order they would appear if sorted.

2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:
   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair of consecutive elements where the earlier element is smaller than the later one. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.
   - Swap this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger than it.
   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position of the first element to get the smallest possible order.

3. **Edge Case**: If the permutation is the last in lexicographic order (i.e., sorted in descending order), the next permutation is the first permutation (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

### Pseudocode

```
function next_permutation(perm):
    n = length of perm
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i == -1:
        reverse perm from start to end
        return perm
    j = n - 1
    while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
        j -= 1
    swap perm[i] and perm[j]
    reverse perm from i + 1 to end
    return perm

read N, K
for each permutation in input:
    result = next_permutation(permutation)
    print result
```

### Python Code

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    n = len(perm)
    i = n - 2
    
    # Find the first decreasing element from the end
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    
    if i == -1:
        # If no such element is found, the permutation is the last one
        perm.reverse()
    else:
        # Find the smallest element larger than perm[i] to the right of i
        j = n - 1
        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
            j -= 1
        # Swap elements at i and j
        perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
        # Reverse the sequence from i+1 to end to get the next permutation
        perm[i + 1:] = reversed(perm[i + 1:])
    
    return perm

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    
    index = 2
    results = []
    for _ in range(K):
        permutation = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, next_perm)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads input from standard input, processes each permutation to find its next lexicographic permutation, and prints the results. The `next_permutation` function implements the logic to find the next permutation as described in the conceptual solution.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a number `N` and `K` permutations of numbers from `1` to `N`. For each permutation, we need to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. If the permutation is the last one in lexicographic order, we should wrap around to the first permutation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the next permutation in lexicographic order, we can use the following steps:
   - Identify the longest suffix that is non-increasing (i.e., find the rightmost position where the order breaks).
   - If the entire sequence is non-increasing, it is the last permutation, so reverse it to get the first permutation.
   - Otherwise, find the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than the element just before the suffix.
   - Swap these two elements.
   - Reverse the suffix to get the next permutation.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function next_permutation(perm):
       n = length of perm
       i = n - 2
       while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
           i -= 1
       if i == -1:
           reverse perm
           return perm
       j = n - 1
       while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
           j -= 1
       swap perm[i] and perm[j]
       reverse perm from i + 1 to end
       return perm

       read N and K
       for each of the K permutations:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1
3 1 2

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a number `N` and `K` permutations of numbers from `1` to `N`. For each permutation, we need to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. If the permutation is the last one in lexicographic order, we should wrap around to the first permutation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the next permutation in lexicographic order, we can use the following steps:
   - Identify the longest suffix that is non-increasing (i.e., find the rightmost position where the order breaks).
   - If the entire sequence is non-increasing, it is the last permutation, so reverse it to get the first permutation.
   - Otherwise, find the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than the element just before the suffix.
   - Swap these two elements.
   - Reverse the suffix to get the next permutation.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function next_permutation(perm):
       n = length of perm
       i = n - 2
       while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find the next lexicographic permutation of a given sequence of numbers. The core concept here is understanding how permutations can be ordered lexicographically and how to efficiently find the next permutation in this order. The key steps involve identifying the longest non-increasing suffix, finding the pivot, swapping it with the smallest larger element in the suffix, and then reversing the suffix.

The strategy that worked was implementing the well-known algorithm for finding the next permutation, which involves:
1. Scanning the sequence from right to left to find the first pair where the order breaks.
2. If no such pair is found, the sequence is the last permutation, and reversing it gives the first permutation.
3. Otherwise, finding the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than the pivot, swapping them, and reversing the suffix.

The implementation was straightforward, and the solution passed all tests without any issues. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation algorithms and their applications in generating sequences in lexicographic order. The solution was efficient and handled the constraints well, given the problem's limits on `N` and `K`.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem of finding the next permutation in lexicographic order, the approach I implemented was quite similar to the official solution. Both solutions follow the standard algorithm for generating the next permutation, which involves identifying the longest non-increasing suffix, finding the pivot, swapping it with the smallest larger element in the suffix, and then reversing the suffix.

Key insights from the official solution:
- The official solution uses a more direct approach to find the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than the pivot. It iterates through the suffix and keeps track of the minimum element that satisfies the condition, which is a straightforward and effective way to handle this step.
- The official solution directly sorts the suffix after swapping, which is a simple way to ensure the suffix is in the smallest possible order. This is equivalent to reversing the suffix in my solution, as the suffix is already in non-increasing order.

Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively implement the next permutation algorithm. The official solution is slightly more concise in handling the suffix, but both approaches are efficient given the constraints. This exercise reinforced the importance of understanding the next permutation algorithm, which is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and useful in various applications.
