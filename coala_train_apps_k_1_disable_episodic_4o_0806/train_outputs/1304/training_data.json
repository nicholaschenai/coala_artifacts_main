    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to find the next lexicographic permutation of a given sequence of numbers. The core concept here is understanding how permutations can be ordered lexicographically and how to efficiently find the next permutation in this order. The key steps involve identifying the longest non-increasing suffix, finding the pivot, swapping it with the smallest larger element in the suffix, and then reversing the suffix.\n\nThe strategy that worked was implementing the well-known algorithm for finding the next permutation, which involves:\n1. Scanning the sequence from right to left to find the first pair where the order breaks.\n2. If no such pair is found, the sequence is the last permutation, and reversing it gives the first permutation.\n3. Otherwise, finding the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than the pivot, swapping them, and reversing the suffix.\n\nThe implementation was straightforward, and the solution passed all tests without any issues. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation algorithms and their applications in generating sequences in lexicographic order. The solution was efficient and handled the constraints well, given the problem's limits on `N` and `K`.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem of finding the next permutation in lexicographic order, the approach I implemented was quite similar to the official solution. Both solutions follow the standard algorithm for generating the next permutation, which involves identifying the longest non-increasing suffix, finding the pivot, swapping it with the smallest larger element in the suffix, and then reversing the suffix.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n- The official solution uses a more direct approach to find the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than the pivot. It iterates through the suffix and keeps track of the minimum element that satisfies the condition, which is a straightforward and effective way to handle this step.\n- The official solution directly sorts the suffix after swapping, which is a simple way to ensure the suffix is in the smallest possible order. This is equivalent to reversing the suffix in my solution, as the suffix is already in non-increasing order.\n\nOverall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively implement the next permutation algorithm. The official solution is slightly more concise in handling the suffix, but both approaches are efficient given the constraints. This exercise reinforced the importance of understanding the next permutation algorithm, which is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and useful in various applications.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes two integers, N and K, followed by K permutations of N integers each. It processes each permutation to find its next lexicographical permutation using a helper function. For each permutation, it computes the next permutation and stores the result as a space-separated string. After processing all permutations, it outputs each resulting permutation on a new line to standard output.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to generate permutations in lexicographic order, such as in combinatorial problems, algorithm design, and optimization tasks. It is particularly relevant in situations where you need to find the next permutation of a sequence, which is a common requirement in problems involving permutations and combinations. This can be applied in generating test cases, solving puzzles, or in any application where permutations need to be systematically explored. The algorithm efficiently finds the next permutation by identifying the longest non-increasing suffix, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix, making it suitable for large sequences up to a certain limit."
