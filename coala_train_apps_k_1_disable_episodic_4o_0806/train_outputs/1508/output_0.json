    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem requires generating a specific pattern based on an integer input `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern is a series of lines, where each line contains a sequence of numbers. The number of lines and the length of each line is determined by `K`. The pattern follows a specific rule: \n\n- For a given `K`, the pattern consists of `K` lines.\n- Each line `i` (0-indexed) contains numbers starting from `i` down to `0`, followed by numbers from `0` up to `i`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Handling**: First, read the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, read the integer `K`.\n2. **Pattern Generation**: For each test case:\n   - Generate `K` lines.\n   - For each line `i` (from 0 to `K-1`):\n     - Create a sequence starting from `i` down to `0`.\n     - Append a sequence from `0` up to `i`.\n3. **Output**: Print the generated pattern for each test case.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction generate_pattern(K):\n    for i from 0 to K-1:\n        line = []\n        for j from i down to 0:\n            append j to line\n        for j from 1 to i:\n            append j to line\n        print line as a string\n\nread T\nfor each test case:\n    read K\n    generate_pattern(K)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(K):\n    for i in range(K):\n        line = []\n        # Append numbers from i down to 0\n        for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n            line.append(str(j))\n        # Append numbers from 1 up to i\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            line.append(str(j))\n        # Print the line as a string\n        print(\"\".join(line))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(T):\n        K = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        generate_pattern(K)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **generate_pattern(K)**: This function generates and prints the pattern for a given `K`. It constructs each line by first appending numbers from `i` down to `0`, and then from `1` up to `i`.\n- **main()**: This function handles input and output. It reads all input data at once, splits it into manageable parts, and processes each test case by calling `generate_pattern(K)`.",
