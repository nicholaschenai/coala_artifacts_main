    "raw_msg": "Let's address the issue with the current solution. The problem seems to be with the way the output is being handled, especially when dealing with multiple test cases. The pattern generation logic is correct, but the output might be getting mixed up due to incorrect handling of multiple test cases.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(K):\n    for i in range(K):\n        line = []\n        # Append numbers from i down to 0\n        for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n            line.append(str(j))\n        # Append numbers from 1 up to i\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            line.append(str(j))\n        # Print the line as a string\n        print(\"\".join(line))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(T):\n        K = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        generate_pattern(K)\n        # Print a blank line to separate test cases if needed\n        if _ < T - 1:\n            print()  # Ensure a blank line is printed between test cases\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Corrections\n\n- **generate_pattern(K)**: This function generates each line of the pattern correctly by appending numbers from `i` down to `0` and then from `1` up to `i`.\n- **main()**: This function reads input and processes each test case separately. It ensures that the pattern for each test case is printed correctly. A blank line is printed between test cases to separate them, except after the last test case.\n\nThis solution should correctly handle multiple test cases and output the expected pattern for each `K`.",
