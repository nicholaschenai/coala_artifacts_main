    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a game of billiards with two players, and the game consists of several rounds. In each round, both players score some points. We need to determine the winner based on the maximum lead one player had over the other at the end of any round. The winner is the player who had the maximum lead, and we need to output the winner's number (1 or 2) and the maximum lead.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start by reading the number of rounds.\n   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.\n   - For each round, update the cumulative scores of both players.\n   - Calculate the lead for the current round by finding the absolute difference between the two cumulative scores.\n   - Track the maximum lead and the player who had this lead.\n   - After processing all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Read the number of rounds N\n   Initialize cumulative_score_player1 and cumulative_score_player2 to 0\n   Initialize max_lead to 0\n   Initialize winner to 0\n\n   For each round from 1 to N:\n       Read scores Si and Ti for player 1 and player 2\n       Update cumulative_score_player1 by adding Si\n       Update cumulative_score_player2 by adding Ti\n       Calculate current_lead as the absolute difference between cumulative_score_player1 and cumulative_score_player2\n       Determine the current leader based on which cumulative score is higher\n       If current_lead is greater than max_lead:\n           Update max_lead to current_lead\n           Update winner to the current leader\n\n   Output winner and max_lead\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_winner_and_lead():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read the number of rounds\n    N = int(data[0])\n    \n    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables\n    cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n    cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n    max_lead = 0\n    winner = 0\n    \n    # Process each round\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(N):\n        # Read scores for player 1 and player 2\n        Si = int(data[index])\n        Ti = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        # Update cumulative scores\n        cumulative_score_player1 += Si\n        cumulative_score_player2 += Ti\n        \n        # Calculate current lead and determine the leader\n        if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n            current_lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2\n            current_leader = 1\n        else:\n            current_lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1\n            current_leader = 2\n        \n        # Update max lead and winner if current lead is greater\n        if current_lead > max_lead:\n            max_lead = current_lead\n            winner = current_leader\n    \n    # Output the winner and the maximum lead\n    print(winner, max_lead)\n\n```",
