Well, there is more to it, but for our\npurposes this is sufficient.\nThe game consists of several rounds and in each round both players\nobtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds\nhave been played, the total score of each player is determined by\nadding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher\ntotal score is declared the winner.\nThe Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where\nthe top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager\nof Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by\nchanging the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the\nend of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once\nall the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the\nend of any round in the game is declared the winner.\n\nConsider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:\nRoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890\n\nThe total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after\neach round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23\nNote that the above table contains the cumulative scores.\nThe winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58\nat the end of round 1) during the game.\nYour task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning\nlead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will\nalways be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.\nInput\nThe first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N\n\u2264 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines\n2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.\nLine i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1\nand 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 \u2264 Si \u2264\n1000 and 1 \u2264 Ti \u2264 1000.  \nOutput\nYour output must consist of a single line containing two integers\nW and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the\nmaximum lead attained by the winner.\nExample\nInput:\n5\n140 82\n89 134\n90 110\n112 106\n88 90\n\nOutput:\n1 58\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

We need to determine the winner based on a special rule: after each round, we calculate the cumulative scores of both players and determine the leader and the lead (the difference between the leader's score and the other player's score). The winner is the player who had the maximum lead at the end of any round. We need to output the winner and the maximum lead.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing cumulative scores for both players and variables to track the maximum lead and the winner.\n2. **Iterate Through Rounds**: For each round, update the cumulative scores for both players.\n3. **Calculate Lead**: Determine the current lead and the leader after each round.\n4. **Update Maximum Lead**: If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded so far, update the maximum lead and record the current leader as the winner.\n5. **Output the Result**: After processing all rounds, output the winner and the maximum lead.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_winner_and_lead(N, scores):\n    initialize player1_cumulative_score to 0\n    initialize player2_cumulative_score to 0\n    initialize max_lead to 0\n    initialize winner to 0\n\n    for each round in scores:\n        update player1_cumulative_score with player1's score for the round\n        update player2_cumulative_score with player2's score for the round\n\n        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:\n            current_lead = player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score\n            current_leader = 1\n        else:\n            current_lead = player2_cumulative_score - player1_cumulative_score\n            current_leader = 2\n\n        if current_lead > max_lead:\n            max_lead = current_lead\n            winner = current_leader\n\n    return winner, max_lead\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_winner_and_lead(N, scores):\n    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables\n    player1_cumulative_score = 0\n    player2_cumulative_score = 0\n    max_lead = 0\n    winner = 0\n\n    # Iterate through each round\n    for score in scores:\n        # Update cumulative scores\n        player1_cumulative_score += score[0]\n        player2_cumulative_score += score[1]\n\n        # Determine current lead and leader\n        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:\n            current_lead = player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score\n            current_leader = 1\n        else:\n            current_lead = player2_cumulative_score - player1_cumulative_score\n            current_leader = 2\n\n        # Update maximum lead and winner if current lead is greater\n        if current_lead > max_lead:\n            max_lead = current_lead\n            winner = current_leader\n\n    # Output the winner and the maximum lead\n    print(winner, max_lead)\n\n# Example usage:\n# N = 5\n# scores = [(140, 82), (89, 134), (90, 110), (112, 106), (88, 90)]\n# find_winner_and_lead(N, scores)\n```\n\nThis code reads the number of rounds and the scores for each round, calculates the cumulative scores, determines the leader and lead after each round, and finally outputs the winner and the maximum lead."

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This was a key oversight that was corrected by explicitly calling the function at the end of the script.\n- The input was read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is suitable for competitive programming environments where input is provided in bulk. This approach worked well once the function was properly invoked.\n\n**Code Snippet:**\n```python\ndef find_winner_and_lead():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n    cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n    max_lead = 0\n    winner = 0\n    \n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(N):\n        Si = int(data[index])\n        Ti = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        cumulative_score_player1 += Si\n        cumulative_score_player2 += Ti\n        \n        if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n            current_lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2\n            current_leader = 1\n        else:\n            current_lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1\n            current_leader = 2\n        \n        if current_lead > max_lead:\n            max_lead = current_lead\n            winner = current_leader\n    \n    print(winner, max_lead)\n\nfind_winner_and_lead()\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of cumulative calculations and lead tracking in competitive programming problems."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Function Call**: One of the initial issues in my solution was not calling the function, which led to no output being generated. This highlights the importance of ensuring that functions are executed, especially in environments where input and output are handled through standard I/O.\n\n2. **Input Handling**: Both my solution and the official solution effectively handle input using standard input reading methods. The official solution uses a loop directly with `input()`, which is straightforward and works well for competitive programming.\n\n3. **Cumulative Score Calculation**: Both solutions maintain cumulative scores for each player and calculate the lead after each round. This is a crucial step in determining the winner based on the maximum lead.\n\n4. **Tracking Maximum Lead**: The official solution uses two separate variables (`mlead1` and `mlead2`) to track the maximum lead for each player, which simplifies the final decision on who the winner is. This approach is slightly different from my single `max_lead` and `winner` tracking, but both achieve the same result.\n\n5. **Efficiency and Simplicity**: The official solution is concise and efficient, using a single loop to process input, update scores, and determine the maximum lead. This simplicity is beneficial in competitive programming for reducing potential errors and improving readability.\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of ensuring function execution and provided a slightly different perspective on tracking maximum leads, which can be useful in similar problems in the future."

        "content": "\n[description for function: find_winner_and_lead]\nThe function reads input data to determine the number of rounds in a game and the scores of two players for each round. It calculates the cumulative scores for both players and determines the current leader and lead after each round. It keeps track of the maximum lead observed and the player who had that lead. After processing all rounds, it outputs the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine a winner based on cumulative performance over multiple rounds, rather than just the final score. This is applicable in sports tournaments, competitive games, or any situation where the lead at any point in time is more significant than the final outcome. It can also be applied in business or project management contexts where interim performance metrics are crucial for decision-making. Understanding how to track cumulative scores and determine the maximum lead can help in designing systems that require real-time leaderboards or performance tracking."
