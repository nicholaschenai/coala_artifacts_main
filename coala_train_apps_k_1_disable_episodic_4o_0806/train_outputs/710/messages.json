The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Both my solution and the official solution break down the problem by iterating over the array while maintaining running maximums and minimums to ensure the constraints are met.\n\n2. **Iterative Approach**: Both solutions use a backward iteration approach, which is effective for problems where the order of elements is crucial. This ensures that when we calculate values for `d`, `c`, `b`, and `a`, we are always considering valid indices.\n\n3. **State Maintenance**: The official solution uses multiple arrays (`fn`, `sn`, `tn`, `fon`) to maintain the state of maximum values at each step. This is a more structured approach compared to my solution, which uses single variables to track these values. The use of arrays can make the logic clearer and easier to follow, especially for complex expressions.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient with a time complexity of O(N), which is optimal given the constraints. The space complexity of the official solution is higher due to the use of additional arrays, but this trade-off can be beneficial for clarity and maintainability.\n\n5. **Learning**: The official solution reinforces the importance of maintaining intermediate results in a structured way, which can simplify the logic and make the solution more robust. This is particularly useful in problems with multiple constraints and complex expressions.\n\nIn summary, while my solution was correct and efficient, the official solution provides a more structured approach to maintaining state, which can be beneficial in similar problems.
