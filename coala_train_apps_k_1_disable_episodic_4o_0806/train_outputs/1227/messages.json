For each test case, we are given the colors of the six sides in a specific order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. We need to determine if there are three sides that are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color. If such a set of sides exists, we output \"YES\"; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the sets of three adjacent sides on a cube. The cube has the following sets of three adjacent sides:\n1. Front, Left, Top\n2. Front, Right, Top\n3. Front, Left, Bottom\n4. Front, Right, Bottom\n5. Back, Left, Top\n6. Back, Right, Top\n7. Back, Left, Bottom\n8. Back, Right, Bottom\n\nFor each test case, we will check these sets to see if any of them have the same color on all three sides. If we find such a set, we output \"YES\"; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the number of test cases, T.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Read the six colors in the order: front, back, left, right, top, bottom.\n   - Check the following sets of three adjacent sides:\n     - (front, left, top)\n     - (front, right, top)\n     - (front, left, bottom)\n     - (front, right, bottom)\n     - (back, left, top)\n     - (back, right, top)\n     - (back, left, bottom)\n     - (back, right, bottom)\n   - If any of these sets have the same color on all three sides, output \"YES\".\n   - Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_adjacent_sides(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        front, back, left, right, top, bottom = case\n        \n        # Check all possible sets of three adjacent sides\n        if (front == left == top) or (front == right == top) or \\\n           (front == left == bottom) or (front == right == bottom) or \\\n           (back == left == top) or (back == right == top) or \\\n           (back == left == bottom) or (back == right == bottom):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().splitlines()\n\nT = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = [line.split() for line in data[1:T+1]]\n\n# Get results\nresults = check_adjacent_sides(T, test_cases)\n\n# Output results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes each test case to check for three adjacent sides with the same color, and outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly."

This is a clean and effective way to handle the combinatorial aspect of the problem.\n       - It defines a helper function `triangle` to determine if three points form a valid triangle by calculating the area using the side lengths. This is an alternative to checking collinearity using the determinant method. The area-based approach is intuitive and leverages the properties of triangles directly.\n\n    2. **Efficient Data Handling:**\n       - The solution uses dictionaries to categorize points by color and to store the count of triangles for each color. This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, as it avoids unnecessary data structures and operations.\n\n    3. **Handling Edge Cases:**\n       - The solution gracefully handles cases where no triangles can be formed by checking if the maximum number of triangles (`mx`) is zero and adjusting the output accordingly. This ensures robustness in the output format.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is a well-structured and efficient approach to solving the problem. It highlights the importance of using built-in modules like `itertools` for combinatorial problems and demonstrates a clear method for checking triangle validity using geometric properties. This experience reinforces the value of leveraging mathematical properties and Python's standard library to simplify complex problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

However, there are some differences in implementation that are worth noting:\n\n1. **Indexing and Adjacency Sets**: \n   - My solution directly checks each possible set of three adjacent sides using hardcoded indices. This approach is straightforward and easy to understand.\n   - The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides. This makes the code more flexible and easier to modify if the adjacency rules change or if additional checks are needed.\n\n2. **Checking for Same Color**:\n   - My solution uses a series of `or` conditions to check if any of the sets of sides have the same color.\n   - The official solution uses a set to check if all three sides in a set have the same color. This is a more elegant and concise way to perform the check, as it leverages the properties of a set to determine if all elements are identical.\n\n3. **Control Flow**:\n   - My solution uses a simple `if-else` structure to print \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n   - The official solution uses a flag (`c`) to determine the output, which is set when a matching set of sides is found. This approach is slightly more complex but can be useful if additional logic is needed after finding a match.\n\nOverall, the official solution is slightly more elegant due to its use of sets and a list of tuples to manage adjacency checks. This makes the code more maintainable and adaptable to changes. In future problems, considering the use of data structures like sets for equality checks and lists for managing related data can lead to cleaner and more efficient code."

        "content": "\n[description for function: check_adjacent_colors]\nThe function processes a list of test cases, where each test case is a string representing colors on the sides of a cube. For each test case, it checks if any set of three specific adjacent sides of the cube have the same color. The sides considered are combinations of front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. If any of these combinations have the same color, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\". The function iterates over each test case and performs this check independently.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a set of conditions is met based on adjacency or arrangement, such as in puzzles, games, or spatial reasoning problems. Specifically, it applies to problems involving cubes or other 3D objects where you need to check for patterns or specific configurations of colors or attributes. This can be extended to any situation where you need to verify if a subset of elements in a structured set (like the sides of a cube) meet a certain condition, such as being the same color or having the same property. It is also relevant in optimization problems where you need to quickly determine if a configuration meets certain criteria, especially when dealing with large datasets or multiple test cases."
