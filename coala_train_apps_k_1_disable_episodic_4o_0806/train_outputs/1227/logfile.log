INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a cube with each of its six sides painted in one of six possible colors: black, blue, red, green, yellow, or orange. For each test case, we are given the colors of the six sides in a specific order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. We need to determine if there are three sides that are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color. If such a set of sides exists, we output "YES"; otherwise, we output "NO".

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to identify the sets of three adjacent sides on a cube. The cube has the following sets of three adjacent sides:
1. Front, Left, Top
2. Front, Right, Top
3. Front, Left, Bottom
4. Front, Right, Bottom
5. Back, Left, Top
6. Back, Right, Top
7. Back, Left, Bottom
8. Back, Right, Bottom

For each test case, we will check these sets to see if any of them have the same color on all three sides. If we find such a set, we output "YES"; otherwise, we output "NO".

## Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases, T.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the six colors in the order: front, back, left, right, top, bottom.
   - Check the following sets of three adjacent sides:
     - (front, left, top)
     - (front, right, top)
     - (front, left, bottom)
     - (front, right, bottom)
     - (back, left, top)
     - (back, right, top)
     - (back, left, bottom)
     - (back, right, bottom)
   - If any of these sets have the same color on all three sides, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

## Python Solution

```python
def check_adjacent_sides(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        front, back, left, right, top, bottom = case
        
        # Check all possible sets of three adjacent sides
        if (front == left == top) or (front == right == top) or \
           (front == left == bottom) or (front == right == bottom) or \
           (back == left == top) or (back == right == top) or \
           (back == left == bottom) or (back == right == bottom):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [line.split() for line in data[1:T+1]]

# Get results
results = check_adjacent_sides(T, test_cases)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This code reads the input, processes each test case to check for three adjacent sides with the same color, and outputs "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for counting triangles with vertices of the same color, I found the official solution insightful in a few ways:

    1. **Use of Combinations and Helper Functions:**
       - The official solution uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to efficiently generate all possible sets of three points for each color. This is a clean and effective way to handle the combinatorial aspect of the problem.
       - It defines a helper function `triangle` to determine if three points form a valid triangle by calculating the area using the side lengths. This is an alternative to checking collinearity using the determinant method. The area-based approach is intuitive and leverages the properties of triangles directly.

    2. **Efficient Data Handling:**
       - The solution uses dictionaries to categorize points by color and to store the count of triangles for each color. This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, as it avoids unnecessary data structures and operations.

    3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
       - The solution gracefully handles cases where no triangles can be formed by checking if the maximum number of triangles (`mx`) is zero and adjusting the output accordingly. This ensures robustness in the output format.

    Overall, the official solution is a well-structured and efficient approach to solving the problem. It highlights the importance of using built-in modules like `itertools` for combinatorial problems and demonstrates a clear method for checking triangle validity using geometric properties. This experience reinforces the value of leveraging mathematical properties and Python's standard library to simplify complex problems.

3. **Output the Result**: If any set of three adjacent sides has the same color, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".

## Pseudocode

```
function check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        colors = test_case.split()
        if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # Front, Left, Bottom
            colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # Front, Right, Bottom
            colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # Back, Left, Top
            colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # Back, Right, Top

            colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # Back, Left, Bottom
            colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):   # Back, Right, Bottom
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        colors = test_case.split()
        # Check all possible sets of three adjacent sides
        if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # Front, Left, Bottom
            colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # Front, Right, Bottom
            colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # Back, Left, Top
            colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # Back, Right, Top

            colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # Back, Left, Bottom
            colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):   # Back, Right, Bottom
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read input

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split('\n')

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])

# Remaining lines are the test cases
test_cases = data[1:T+1]

# Check each test case
check_adjacent_colors(test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case, and checks the specified sets of adjacent sides for matching colors, outputting "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was understanding the adjacency of sides on a cube and checking if any set of three adjacent sides are painted the same color. The challenge was to correctly identify the sets of adjacent sides and efficiently check them for each test case.

The strategy that worked was to list all possible sets of three adjacent sides on a cube and then check each set for color uniformity. This approach was straightforward and efficient given the constraints, as it involved a constant number of checks per test case.

The problem was relatively simple, and there were no unexpected errors. The solution involved iterating over the test cases, splitting the input to get the colors, and then using a series of logical conditions to determine if any of the specified sets of sides were the same color. The use of direct string comparison for the colors was effective and avoided unnecessary complexity.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships and translating them into logical conditions in code. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without issues.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a cube with each of its six sides painted in one of six possible colors: black, blue, red, green, yellow, or orange. For each test case, we are given the colors of the six sides in a specific order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. Our task is to determine if there are three sides that are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color. If such a set of sides exists, we should output "YES"; otherwise, output "NO".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand Adjacency on a Cube**: On a cube, the following sets of three sides are pairwise adjacent:
   - Front, Left, Bottom
   - Front, Right, Bottom
   - Back, Left, Top
   - Back, Right, Top
   - Front, Left, Top
   - Front, Right, Top
   - Back, Left, Bottom
   - Back, Right, Bottom

2. **Check Each Test Case**: For each test case, we need to check if any of these sets of three sides have the same color.

3. **Output the Result**: If any set of three adjacent sides has the same color, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".

## Pseudocode

```
function check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        colors = test_case.split()
        if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # Front, Left, Bottom
            colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # Front, Right, Bottom
            colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # Back, Left, Top
            colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # Back, Right, Top
            colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # Front, Left, Top
            colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # Front, Right, Top
            colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # Back, Left, Bottom
            colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):   # Back, Right, Bottom
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        colors = test_case.split()
        # Check all possible sets of three adjacent sides

            colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # Front, Right, Bottom

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution correctly identify whether there are three pairwise adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. However, there are some differences in implementation that are worth noting:

1. **Indexing and Adjacency Sets**: 
   - My solution directly checks each possible set of three adjacent sides using hardcoded indices. This approach is straightforward and easy to understand.
   - The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides. This makes the code more flexible and easier to modify if the adjacency rules change or if additional checks are needed.

2. **Checking for Same Color**:
   - My solution uses a series of `or` conditions to check if any of the sets of sides have the same color.
   - The official solution uses a set to check if all three sides in a set have the same color. This is a more elegant and concise way to perform the check, as it leverages the properties of a set to determine if all elements are identical.

3. **Control Flow**:
   - My solution uses a simple `if-else` structure to print "YES" or "NO".
   - The official solution uses a flag (`c`) to determine the output, which is set when a matching set of sides is found. This approach is slightly more complex but can be useful if additional logic is needed after finding a match.

Overall, the official solution is slightly more elegant due to its use of sets and a list of tuples to manage adjacency checks. This makes the code more maintainable and adaptable to changes. In future problems, considering the use of data structures like sets for equality checks and lists for managing related data can lead to cleaner and more efficient code.
