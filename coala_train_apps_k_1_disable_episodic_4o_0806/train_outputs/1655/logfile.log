```

You have the following lattice points with their corresponding coordinates and each one with an specific colour.

 ```
Point   [x ,  y]     Colour
----------------------------
  A     [ 3,  4]     Blue
  B     [-7, -1]     Red

  H     [-3,  5]     Red
  I     [-3, -5]     Blue
  J     [ 4,  1]     Blue
```
We want to count the triangles that have the three vertices with the same colour. The following picture shows the distribution of the points in the plane with the required triangles.

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/sP0l1i1.png)

The input that we will have for the field of lattice points described above is:

```
[[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"],
 [[1, -5], "red"],   [[-1, 4], "red"],  [[1, 7], "red"],     [[-3, 5], "red"], 
 [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ]
```
We see the following result from it:

```
Colour   Amount of Triangles       Triangles
Yellow         0                    -------
Blue           1                      AIJ
Red            10                   BEF,BEG,BEH,BFG,BFH,BGH,EFG,EFH,EHG,FGH
```
As we have 5 different points in red and each combination of 3 points that are not aligned.

We need a code that may give us the following information in order:

```
1) Total given points
2) Total number of colours
3) Total number of possible triangles
4) and 5) The colour (or colours, sorted alphabetically) with the highest amount of triangles
```

In Python our function will work like:

```
[10, 3, 11, ["red",10]]) == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"], 
                                              [[1, -5], "red"],   [[-1, 4], "red"],  [[1, 7], "red"],     [[-3, 5], "red"],
                                              [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
In the following case we have some points that are aligned and we have less triangles that can be formed:

```
[10, 3, 7, ["red", 6]] == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"],
                                            [[1, -5], "red"],   [[1, 1], "red"],   [[1, 7], "red"],     [[1, 4], "red"], 
                                            [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
Just to see the change with the previous case we have this:

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/cCgO7ql.png)

In the special case that the list of points does not generate an even single triangle, the output will be like this case:

```
[9, 3, 0, []] == count_col_triang([[[1, -2], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"], [[1, -5], "red"],
                                  [[1, 1], "red"],   [[1, 7], "red"],     [[1, 4], "red"],    [[-3, -5], "blue"], 
                                  [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
It will be this case:

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/VB7t7Ij.png)

If in the result we have two or more colours with the same maximum amount of triangles, the last list should be like (e.g)

```
[35, 6, 35, ["blue", "red", "yellow", 23]]     # having the names of the colours sorted alphabetically
```
For the condition of three algined points A, B, C, you should know that the the following determinant should be 0.

```
 | xA    yA    1|
 | xB    yB    1|    = 0
 | xC    yC    1|

```
Assumptions:

- In the list you have unique points, so a point can have only one colour.

- All the inputs are valid

INFO - [Task id] 1655 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a list of points, each with coordinates and a color. We need to determine the number of triangles that can be formed using points of the same color. The output should include:
1. Total number of points.
2. Total number of unique colors.
3. Total number of triangles that can be formed.
4. The color(s) with the highest number of triangles and the count of those triangles.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Count Points and Colors**: First, count the total number of points and identify all unique colors.
2. **Group Points by Color**: Organize the points into groups based on their color.
3. **Calculate Triangles**: For each color group, calculate the number of triangles that can be formed. A triangle can be formed if three points are not collinear.
4. **Check Collinearity**: Use the determinant method to check if three points are collinear. If the determinant is zero, the points are collinear.
5. **Determine Maximum Triangles**: Identify the color(s) with the maximum number of triangles.
6. **Output the Results**: Return the total points, total colors, total triangles, and the color(s) with the maximum triangles.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_col_triang(points):
    total_points = length of points
    color_groups = dictionary to group points by color
    
    for each point in points:
        add point to color_groups based on its color
    
    total_colors = length of color_groups
    total_triangles = 0
    max_triangles = 0
    max_colors = []
    
    for each color in color_groups:
        points_of_color = color_groups[color]
        num_points = length of points_of_color
        triangles = 0
        
        for each combination of 3 points in points_of_color:
            if not are_collinear(point1, point2, point3):
                triangles += 1

            append color to max_colors
    
    sort max_colors alphabetically
    return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, max_colors + [max_triangles]]

function are_collinear(p1, p2, p3):
    x1, y1 = p1

    x3, y3 = p3
    determinant = x1*(y2 - y3) + x2*(y3 - y1) + x3*(y1 - y2)

    x1, y1 = p1
    x2, y2 = p2
    x3, y3 = p3

    determinant = x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)
    return determinant == 0

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Interval Coloring Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the overlap (green area) between two sets of intervals on the X-axis, colored blue and yellow. The key challenge is to determine an optimal coloring strategy that maximizes this overlap.

    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted a simple alternating coloring strategy, which failed because it did not consider the actual overlap between intervals. This approach was too naive and did not account for the specific arrangement and overlap of intervals, leading to suboptimal results.

    #### Revised Strategy
    The revised approach involved sorting the intervals by their starting points and then using a greedy strategy to color them based on their overlap with previously colored intervals. The idea was to alternate colors when intervals overlap to ensure maximum green area. However, this approach also failed because it did not correctly handle the overlap logic.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution involved a more nuanced understanding of the problem. By sorting the intervals and carefully alternating colors based on their positions and overlaps, I aimed to maximize the green area. However, the solution still did not pass the test cases, indicating a need for further refinement in the overlap logic.

    #### Lessons Learned
    - **Overlap Consideration**: Simply alternating colors is insufficient; the solution must consider the specific overlaps between intervals.
    - **Greedy Approach**: A greedy approach can be effective but requires careful implementation to ensure it correctly maximizes the desired outcome.
    - **Testing and Debugging**: Thorough testing with various input scenarios is crucial to identify and fix logical errors in the approach.

    This problem highlighted the importance of understanding the underlying logic of interval overlaps and the need for a strategic approach to maximize the desired outcome.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1655 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a set of points on a 2D plane, each with a specific color. We need to determine how many triangles can be formed where all three vertices are of the same color. The output should include:
   - Total number of points.
   - Total number of unique colors.
   - Total number of triangles that can be formed.
   - The color(s) with the highest number of triangles and the count of those triangles.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, categorize the points by their color.
   - For each color, find all possible combinations of three points.
   - Check if these three points form a triangle (i.e., they are not collinear).
   - Count the number of valid triangles for each color.
   - Determine the color(s) with the maximum number of triangles.
   - Return the total number of points, number of unique colors, total triangles, and the color(s) with the most triangles.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function count_col_triang(points):
       Initialize a dictionary to store points by color
       For each point in points:
           Add the point to the list of its color in the dictionary

       Initialize a dictionary to store triangle counts by color
       For each color in the dictionary:
           Get the list of points for that color
           If there are less than 3 points, continue to the next color
           For each combination of 3 points:
               If the points are not collinear:
                   Increment the triangle count for that color

       Find the maximum triangle count
       Find all colors with this maximum count
       Sort these colors alphabetically

       Return the total number of points, number of unique colors, total triangles, and the color(s) with the most triangles
   ```

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a set of points on a 2D plane, each with a specific color. We need to determine how many triangles can be formed where all three vertices are of the same color. The output should include:
   - Total number of points.
   - Total number of unique colors.
   - Total number of triangles that can be formed.
   - The color(s) with the highest number of triangles and the count of those triangles.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, categorize the points by their color.
   - For each color, find all possible combinations of three points.
   - Check if these three points form a triangle (i.e., they are not collinear).
   - Count the number of valid triangles for each color.
   - Determine the color(s) with the maximum number of triangles.
   - Return the total number of points, number of unique colors, total triangles, and the color(s) with the most triangles.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function count_col_triang(points):
       Initialize a dictionary to store points by color
       For each point in points:
           Add the point to the list of its color in the dictionary

       Initialize a dictionary to store triangle counts by color
       For each color in the dictionary:
           Get the list of points for that color
           If there are less than 3 points, continue to the next color
           For each combination of 3 points:
               If the points are not collinear:
                   Increment the triangle count for that color

       Find the maximum triangle count
       Find all colors with this maximum count
       Sort these colors alphabetically

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
```if:java
___Note for Java users:___ Due to type checking in Java, inputs and outputs are formated quite differently in this language. See the footnotes of the description.


```

You have the following lattice points with their corresponding coordinates and each one with an specific colour.

 ```
Point   [x ,  y]     Colour
----------------------------
  A     [ 3,  4]     Blue
  B     [-7, -1]     Red
  C     [ 7, -6]     Yellow
  D     [ 2,  5]     Yellow
  E     [ 1, -5]     Red
  F     [-1,  4]     Red
  G     [ 1,  7]     Red
  H     [-3,  5]     Red
  I     [-3, -5]     Blue
  J     [ 4,  1]     Blue
```
We want to count the triangles that have the three vertices with the same colour. The following picture shows the distribution of the points in the plane with the required triangles.

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/sP0l1i1.png)

The input that we will have for the field of lattice points described above is:

```
[[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"],
 [[1, -5], "red"],   [[-1, 4], "red"],  [[1, 7], "red"],     [[-3, 5], "red"], 
 [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ]
```
We see the following result from it:

```
Colour   Amount of Triangles       Triangles
Yellow         0                    -------
Blue           1                      AIJ
Red            10                   BEF,BEG,BEH,BFG,BFH,BGH,EFG,EFH,EHG,FGH
```
As we have 5 different points in red and each combination of 3 points that are not aligned.

We need a code that may give us the following information in order:

```
1) Total given points
2) Total number of colours
3) Total number of possible triangles
4) and 5) The colour (or colours, sorted alphabetically) with the highest amount of triangles
```

In Python our function will work like:

```
[10, 3, 11, ["red",10]]) == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"], 
                                              [[1, -5], "red"],   [[-1, 4], "red"],  [[1, 7], "red"],     [[-3, 5], "red"],
                                              [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
In the following case we have some points that are aligned and we have less triangles that can be formed:

```
[10, 3, 7, ["red", 6]] == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"],
                                            [[1, -5], "red"],   [[1, 1], "red"],   [[1, 7], "red"],     [[1, 4], "red"], 
                                            [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
Just to see the change with the previous case we have this:

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/cCgO7ql.png)

In the special case that the list of points does not generate an even single triangle, the output will be like this case:

```
[9, 3, 0, []] == count_col_triang([[[1, -2], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"], [[1, -5], "red"],
                                  [[1, 1], "red"],   [[1, 7], "red"],     [[1, 4], "red"],    [[-3, -5], "blue"], 
                                  [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
It will be this case:

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/VB7t7Ij.png)

If in the result we have two or more colours with the same maximum amount of triangles, the last list should be like (e.g)

```
[35, 6, 35, ["blue", "red", "yellow", 23]]     # having the names of the colours sorted alphabetically
```
For the condition of three algined points A, B, C, you should know that the the following determinant should be 0.

```
 | xA    yA    1|
 | xB    yB    1|    = 0
 | xC    yC    1|

```
Assumptions:

- In the list you have unique points, so a point can have only one colour.

- All the inputs are valid

Enjoy it!

INFO - [Task id] 1655 [generation text] In this problem, I worked on determining the number of triangles that can be formed from a set of colored points on a 2D plane, where all vertices of the triangle must be of the same color. The task involved several key steps: categorizing points by color, generating combinations of points, checking for collinearity, and counting valid triangles.

The core concept was to use combinatorial logic to generate all possible sets of three points for each color and then use a mathematical determinant to check if these points are collinear. If they are not collinear, they form a valid triangle. This approach required understanding how to efficiently use combinations and mathematical checks to filter out invalid triangles.

One strategy that worked well was using Python's `itertools.combinations` to generate point combinations and a simple determinant calculation to check for collinearity. This allowed for a clean and efficient solution. The use of dictionaries to categorize points by color and store triangle counts was also effective in organizing the data and results.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts and using mathematical properties to solve geometric problems. The solution was straightforward once the problem was decomposed into these logical steps.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
```if:java
___Note for Java users:___ Due to type checking in Java, inputs and outputs are formated quite differently in this language. See the footnotes of the description.


```

You have the following lattice points with their corresponding coordinates and each one with an specific colour.

 ```
Point   [x ,  y]     Colour
----------------------------
  A     [ 3,  4]     Blue
  B     [-7, -1]     Red
  C     [ 7, -6]     Yellow
  D     [ 2,  5]     Yellow
  E     [ 1, -5]     Red
  F     [-1,  4]     Red
  G     [ 1,  7]     Red
  H     [-3,  5]     Red
  I     [-3, -5]     Blue
  J     [ 4,  1]     Blue
```
We want to count the triangles that have the three vertices with the same colour. The following picture shows the distribution of the points in the plane with the required triangles.

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/sP0l1i1.png)

The input that we will have for the field of lattice points described above is:

```
[[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"],
 [[1, -5], "red"],   [[-1, 4], "red"],  [[1, 7], "red"],     [[-3, 5], "red"], 
 [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ]
```
We see the following result from it:

```
Colour   Amount of Triangles       Triangles
Yellow         0                    -------
Blue           1                      AIJ
Red            10                   BEF,BEG,BEH,BFG,BFH,BGH,EFG,EFH,EHG,FGH
```
As we have 5 different points in red and each combination of 3 points that are not aligned.

We need a code that may give us the following information in order:

```
1) Total given points
2) Total number of colours
3) Total number of possible triangles
4) and 5) The colour (or colours, sorted alphabetically) with the highest amount of triangles
```

In Python our function will work like:

```
[10, 3, 11, ["red",10]]) == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"], 
                                              [[1, -5], "red"],   [[-1, 4], "red"],  [[1, 7], "red"],     [[-3, 5], "red"],
                                              [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
In the following case we have some points that are aligned and we have less triangles that can be formed:

```
[10, 3, 7, ["red", 6]] == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], "blue"],  [[-7, -1], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"],
                                            [[1, -5], "red"],   [[1, 1], "red"],   [[1, 7], "red"],     [[1, 4], "red"], 
                                            [[-3, -5], "blue"], [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
Just to see the change with the previous case we have this:

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/cCgO7ql.png)

In the special case that the list of points does not generate an even single triangle, the output will be like this case:

```
[9, 3, 0, []] == count_col_triang([[[1, -2], "red"], [[7, -6], "yellow"], [[2, 5], "yellow"], [[1, -5], "red"],
                                  [[1, 1], "red"],   [[1, 7], "red"],     [[1, 4], "red"],    [[-3, -5], "blue"], 
                                  [[4, 1], "blue"] ])
```
It will be this case:

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/VB7t7Ij.png)

If in the result we have two or more colours with the same maximum amount of triangles, the last list should be like (e.g)

```
[35, 6, 35, ["blue", "red", "yellow", 23]]     # having the names of the colours sorted alphabetically
```
For the condition of three algined points A, B, C, you should know that the the following determinant should be 0.

```
 | xA    yA    1|
 | xB    yB    1|    = 0
 | xC    yC    1|

```
Assumptions:

- In the list you have unique points, so a point can have only one colour.

- All the inputs are valid

Enjoy it!

   - First, categorize the points by their color.
   - For each color, find all possible combinations of three points.
   - Check if these three points form a triangle (i.e., they are not collinear).
   - Count the number of valid triangles for each color.
   - Determine the color(s) with the maximum number of triangles.
   - Return the total number of points, number of unique colors, total triangles, and the color(s) with the most triangles.

   ```
   function count_col_triang(points):
       Initialize a dictionary to store points by color
       For each point in points:
           Add the point to the list of its color in the dictionary

       Initialize a dictionary to store triangle counts by color
       For each color in the dictionary:
           Get the list of points for that color
           If there are less than 3 points, continue to the next color
           For each combination of 3 points:
               If the points are not collinear:
                   Increment the triangle count for that color

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1655 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for counting triangles with vertices of the same color, I found the official solution insightful in a few ways:

1. **Use of Combinations and Helper Functions:**
   - The official solution uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to efficiently generate all possible sets of three points for each color. This is a clean and effective way to handle the combinatorial aspect of the problem.
   - It defines a helper function `triangle` to determine if three points form a valid triangle by calculating the area using the side lengths. This is an alternative to checking collinearity using the determinant method. The area-based approach is intuitive and leverages the properties of triangles directly.

2. **Efficient Data Handling:**
   - The solution uses dictionaries to categorize points by color and to store the count of triangles for each color. This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, as it avoids unnecessary data structures and operations.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The solution gracefully handles cases where no triangles can be formed by checking if the maximum number of triangles (`mx`) is zero and adjusting the output accordingly. This ensures robustness in the output format.

Overall, the official solution is a well-structured and efficient approach to solving the problem. It highlights the importance of using built-in modules like `itertools` for combinatorial problems and demonstrates a clear method for checking triangle validity using geometric properties. This experience reinforces the value of leveraging mathematical properties and Python's standard library to simplify complex problems.

    If in the result we have two or more colours with the same maximum amount of triangles, the last list should be like (e.g)

    ```
    [35, 6, 35, ["blue", "red", "yellow", 23]]     # having the names of the colours sorted alphabetically
    ```
    For the condition of three algined points A, B, C, you should know that the the following determinant should be 0.

    ```
     | xA    yA    1|
     | xB    yB    1|    = 0
     | xC    yC    1|

    ```
    Assumptions:

    - In the list you have unique points, so a point can have only one colour.

    - All the inputs are valid

    Enjoy it!

    ___For java users:___

    Two immutable objects, `ColouredPoint` and `TriangleResult`, have been designed for you in the preloaded part. You will receive inputs as lists of ColouredPoint objects and will return a TriangleResult object. For the last one, you may note the organization of the arguments of the constructor which differs a bit from the description above.

    You may find below the signatures of the available methods of these objects:
