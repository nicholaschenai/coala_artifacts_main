    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no such sequence exists. The goal is to return the final string after all possible removals.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Use a Stack**: We can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts. As we iterate through the string, we push characters onto the stack. If the top of the stack has the same character as the current one, we increment the count. If the count reaches `k`, we pop the character from the stack.\n\n2. **Rebuild the String**: After processing the entire string, the stack will contain characters and their counts that were not removed. We can then rebuild the final string from this stack.\n\n3. **Iterate and Process**: This process ensures that we only traverse the string once, making it efficient. The stack helps in managing the removal of sequences in a straightforward manner.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction removeDuplicates(s, k):\n    initialize stack as empty list\n    for each character in s:\n        if stack is not empty and stack top character is same as current character:\n            increment the count of the top element in the stack\n            if count equals k:\n                pop the top element from the stack\n        else:\n            push (character, 1) onto the stack\n    initialize result as empty string\n    for each (character, count) in stack:\n        append character * count to result\n    return result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        # Initialize a stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n        stack = []\n        \n        # Iterate over each character in the string\n        for char in s:\n            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                # If the top of the stack has the same character, increment the count\n                stack[-1][1] += 1\n                # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack\n                if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                    stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, push the character with a count of 1 onto the stack\n                stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n        # Rebuild the final string from the stack\n        result = ''\n        for char, count in stack:\n            result += char * count\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently removes `k` adjacent duplicates by using a stack to track characters and their counts, ensuring that the process is both clear and optimal.",
