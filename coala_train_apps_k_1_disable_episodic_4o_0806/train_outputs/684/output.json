    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nYou and the Grinch are playing a game with a number \\( N \\). You start first. On each turn, a player can either:\n- Divide \\( N \\) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1.\n- Subtract 1 from \\( N \\) if \\( N \\) is greater than 1.\n\nThe player who cannot make a move loses. Given multiple test cases, determine if you (the first player) will win or lose for each initial \\( N \\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Game Analysis**: \n   - If \\( N = 1 \\), you lose immediately because no moves are possible.\n   - If \\( N \\) is even, you can always subtract 1 to make it odd, or divide by an odd divisor if possible.\n   - If \\( N \\) is odd, you can either subtract 1 to make it even or divide by an odd divisor.\n\n2. **Winning Strategy**:\n   - The key is to determine if you can force the Grinch into a losing position.\n   - If \\( N \\) is even, you can always make it odd by subtracting 1, and then the Grinch will face an odd number.\n   - If \\( N \\) is odd, you can either subtract 1 to make it even or divide by an odd divisor.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - If \\( N \\) is 1, you lose.\n   - If \\( N \\) is 2, you win by subtracting 1.\n   - For \\( N > 2 \\), the pattern depends on the ability to force the opponent into a losing position.\n\n4. **Simplified Strategy**:\n   - If \\( N \\) is even, you can always win by making it odd.\n   - If \\( N \\) is odd, you can win if you can force the Grinch into a position where he faces an even number.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction determine_winner(N):\n    if N == 1:\n        return \"Grinch\"\n    elif N % 2 == 0:\n        return \"Me\"\n    else:\n        return \"Me\" if N > 2 else \"Grinch\"\n\nread T\nfor each test case:\n    read N\n    print determine_winner(N)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef determine_winner(N):\n    # If N is 1, the first player (Me) cannot make a move, so Grinch wins\n    if N == 1:\n        return \" Grinch\"\n    # If N is even, the first player can always make it odd, ensuring a win\n    elif N % 2 == 0:\n        return \" Me\"\n    else:\n        # If N is odd and greater than 1, the first player can make it even\n        return \" Me\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        results.append(determine_winner(N))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis solution reads the number of test cases and for each test case, determines the winner based on the rules and strategy discussed. The results are printed for each test case.",
