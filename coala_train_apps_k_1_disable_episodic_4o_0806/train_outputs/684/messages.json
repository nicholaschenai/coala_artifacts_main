This insight allowed for a more direct approach rather than iterating over all possible boxes.\n\n    2. **Efficient Calculation**: The official solution leverages the mathematical property of perfect squares and uses integer division and square root calculations to directly compute the number of rooms that can be tiled. This approach is both time-efficient and straightforward, reducing the complexity from iterating over all numbers up to `N` to simply calculating the integer square root of `N/2`.\n\n    3. **Simplifying the Problem**: By dividing `N` by 2 upfront, the problem is simplified to finding how many perfect squares exist up to `N/2`. This simplification is a powerful technique in problem-solving, where reducing the problem space can lead to more efficient solutions.\n\n    4. **Python Built-ins**: The use of Python's built-in functions like `int()` for floor division and `**0.5` for square root calculations demonstrates the importance of understanding and utilizing language features to write concise and efficient code.\n\n    Overall, the official solution provided a more elegant and efficient approach than my initial attempts, highlighting the importance of mathematical insights and simplification in algorithm design.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The game rules allowed two types of moves: dividing by an odd divisor greater than 1 or subtracting 1. The challenge was to determine if the first player (Me) could always win given the initial number \\( N \\).\n\nThe core concept was recognizing that if \\( N \\) is even, the first player can always make it odd by subtracting 1, which generally puts the opponent in a disadvantageous position. Conversely, if \\( N \\) is odd, the first player can either subtract 1 to make it even or divide by an odd divisor, maintaining control over the game. The only exception is when \\( N = 1 \\), where the first player has no moves and loses immediately.\n\nThe solution involved a simple check:\n- If \\( N = 1 \\), the first player loses.\n- If \\( N \\) is even, the first player wins.\n- If \\( N \\) is odd and greater than 1, the first player also wins.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of analyzing game states and leveraging parity to determine winning strategies. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was efficient, handling up to 100 test cases with numbers as large as \\( 10^9 \\)."
