The goal is to see if you can end up with exactly `z` liters in one or both jugs.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nThe problem is a classic example of the \"water jug problem,\" which can be solved using the mathematical concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

My initial solution and the official solution both rely on this concept, but there are some differences in implementation.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **GCD and Water Jug Problem**: The core insight is that you can measure exactly `z` liters if `z` is a multiple of the GCD of `x` and `y`, and `z` is less than or equal to the sum of `x` and `y`. This is because any measurable amount using the two jugs can be expressed as a linear combination of `x` and `y`.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes additional checks for edge cases, such as when one of the jugs has zero capacity or when `z` is negative. These checks ensure robustness in scenarios that might not be immediately obvious.\n\n3. **Simplification by Swapping**: The official solution swaps `x` and `y` to ensure `x` is always the smaller jug. This simplifies the logic when calculating the GCD and checking divisibility, as it reduces the number of conditions to consider.\n\n4. **Iterative GCD Calculation**: The official solution uses an iterative approach to calculate the GCD, which is slightly different from the Euclidean algorithm I used. Both methods are valid, but the official solution's approach is more explicit in handling the remainder and swapping operations.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution provides a more comprehensive handling of edge cases and simplifies the logic by ensuring `x` is always the smaller jug. This can be a useful strategy in similar problems to reduce complexity. Additionally, the explicit handling of zero-capacity jugs and negative `z` values adds robustness to the solution. Overall, the problem reinforces the importance of understanding the mathematical properties underlying a problem and how they can be applied to derive efficient solutions."
