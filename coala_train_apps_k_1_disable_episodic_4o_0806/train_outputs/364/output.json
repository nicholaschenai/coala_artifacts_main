    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nYou have two jugs with capacities `x` and `y` liters, and an infinite water supply. You need to determine if it's possible to measure exactly `z` liters using these two jugs. You can fill, empty, or pour water between the jugs. The goal is to have exactly `z` liters in one or both jugs.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nThe problem is a classic example of the \"water jug problem,\" which can be solved using the mathematical concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The key insight is that you can measure exactly `z` liters if and only if `z` is a multiple of the GCD of `x` and `y`, and `z` is less than or equal to the sum of `x` and `y`.\n\n1. **Check if `z` is greater than the sum of `x` and `y`:** If `z` is greater than `x + y`, it's impossible to measure `z` liters because the total capacity of both jugs is insufficient.\n2. **Calculate the GCD of `x` and `y`:** Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n3. **Check if `z` is a multiple of the GCD:** If `z` is a multiple of the GCD, then it is possible to measure `z` liters using the jugs.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction canMeasureWater(x, y, z):\n    if z > x + y:\n        return False\n    gcd_value = gcd(x, y)\n    return z % gcd_value == 0\n\nfunction gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        temp = b\n        b = a % b\n        a = temp\n    return a\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def gcd(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        # Helper function to calculate the greatest common divisor\n        while b != 0:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    def canMeasureWater(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> bool:\n        # If z is greater than the total capacity of both jugs, it's impossible\n        if z > x + y:\n            return False\n        # Calculate the GCD of x and y\n        gcd_value = self.gcd(x, y)\n        # Check if z is a multiple of the GCD\n        return z % gcd_value == 0\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently determines if it's possible to measure exactly `z` liters using the two jugs by leveraging the properties of the GCD.",
