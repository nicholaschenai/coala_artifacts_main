INFO - [Task id] 1556 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to generate a pattern based on a given integer \( K \) for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of \( K \) lines. Each line alternates between '1' and '0', starting with '1'. The number of characters in each line is equal to the line number (i.e., the first line has 1 character, the second line has 2 characters, etc.).

## Conceptual Solution

1. Read the number of test cases, \( T \).
2. For each test case, read the integer \( K \).
3. For each test case, generate \( K \) lines:
   - For each line \( i \) (where \( i \) ranges from 1 to \( K \)), generate a string of length \( i \) that alternates between '1' and '0', starting with '1'.
4. Print the generated pattern for each test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function generate_pattern(K):
    for i from 1 to K:
        line = ""
        for j from 0 to i-1:
            if j is even:
                line += "1"
            else:
                line += "0"
        print(line)

read T
for each test case:
    read K
    generate_pattern(K)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def generate_pattern(K):
    for i in range(1, K + 1):
        line = ""
        for j in range(i):
            if j % 2 == 0:
                line += "1"
            else:
                line += "0"
        print(line)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(T):
        K = int(data[index])
        generate_pattern(K)
        index += 1

main()
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **generate_pattern(K):** This function generates and prints the pattern for a given \( K \). It iterates from 1 to \( K \) to create each line. For each line, it alternates between '1' and '0' based on the index \( j \).
  
- **main():** This function handles input and output. It reads all input at once, splits it into a list, and processes each test case by calling `generate_pattern` with the appropriate \( K \). The `sys.stdin.read` is used to handle input efficiently for multiple test cases.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Pattern Generation Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating a specific pattern based on an integer input `K` for multiple test cases. The pattern consists of `K` lines, where each line `i` (0-indexed) is constructed by:
    - Counting down from `i` to `0`.
    - Counting up from `1` to `i`.

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the logic for generating each line of the pattern was implemented correctly. However, the main issue was with handling the output format, especially when dealing with multiple test cases. The output was not matching the expected format due to extra blank lines being printed between test cases.

    #### Fixes and Lessons Learned
    The key fix was to ensure that the output for each test case is printed correctly without extra blank lines. This was achieved by conditionally printing a blank line only between test cases, except after the last one. This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing output formatting, especially in problems involving multiple test cases.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the expected pattern for each `K`. The function `generate_pattern(K)` generates each line of the pattern, and the `main()` function manages input and output, ensuring the correct format. This approach can be applied to similar pattern generation problems in the future.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1556 [generation text] ### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to generate a pattern based on an integer input `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line should alternate between '1' and '0', starting with '1'. The number of lines and the number of characters in each line is determined by the value of `K`.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

For each test case:
- Read the integer `K`.
- For each line from 1 to `K`:
  - Generate a string of length `K` that alternates between '1' and '0', starting with '1'.
  - Print this string.

Repeat the above steps for each test case, ensuring that the output for each test case is separated correctly.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function generate_pattern(K):
    for i from 1 to K:
        pattern_line = ""
        for j from 1 to K:
            if j is odd:
                pattern_line += "1"
            else:
                pattern_line += "0"
        print pattern_line

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read K
        generate_pattern(K)
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def generate_pattern(K):
    # Loop through each line from 1 to K
    for i in range(1, K + 1):
        # Initialize an empty string for the current line
        pattern_line = ""
        # Loop through each position in the line
        for j in range(1, K + 1):
            # Append '1' if the position is odd, '0' if even
            if j % 2 == 1:
                pattern_line += "1"
            else:
                pattern_line += "0"
        # Print the constructed line

The challenge was to ensure the correct output format, especially managing newlines between test cases.

Key concepts involved:
- Iterating over a range to construct strings with alternating characters.
- Handling multiple test cases and ensuring correct output formatting.

The solution involved:
1. Reading all input at once and splitting it into manageable parts.
2. Iterating over each test case to generate the required pattern.
3. Constructing each line by checking the parity of the index to decide whether to append '1' or '0'.
4. Managing newlines between test cases to ensure the output format matched the requirements.

The approach was straightforward, and the main focus was on correctly implementing the pattern generation and managing input/output efficiently. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and robustness. This problem reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling in competitive programming scenarios.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1556 [prompt] ### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to generate a pattern based on an integer input `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line should alternate between '1' and '0', starting with '1'. The number of lines and the number of characters in each line is determined by the value of `K`.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

For each test case:
- Read the integer `K`.
- For each line from 1 to `K`:
  - Generate a string of length `K` that alternates between '1' and '0', starting with '1'.
  - Print this string.

Repeat the above steps for each test case, ensuring that the output for each test case is separated correctly.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function generate_pattern(K):
    for i from 1 to K:
        pattern_line = ""
        for j from 1 to K:
            if j is odd:
                pattern_line += "1"
            else:
                pattern_line += "0"
        print pattern_line

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read K
        generate_pattern(K)
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def generate_pattern(K):
    # Loop through each line from 1 to K
    for i in range(1, K + 1):
        # Initialize an empty string for the current line
        pattern_line = ""
        # Loop through each position in the line
        for j in range(1, K + 1):
            # Append '1' if the position is odd, '0' if even
            if j % 2 == 1:
                pattern_line += "1"
            else:
                pattern_line += "0"
        # Print the constructed line
        print(pattern_line)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    # Read all input at once
    data = input().strip().split()
    # First line is the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    # For each test case, read K and generate the pattern
    for t in range(T):
        K = int(data[t + 1])
        generate_pattern(K)
        # Print a newline between test cases, but not after the last one
        if t < T - 1:
            print()

# Call the main function to execute the program
main()
```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the required pattern for each value of `K`. It ensures that the output format is correct by managing newlines between test cases.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for _ in range(int(input())):
	n = int(input())
	num = ""
	val = 1
	for i in range(n):
		num += str(val)
		if val == 1:
			val = 0
		else:
			val = 1
	for i in range(n):
		print(num)
		
	


INFO - [Task id] 1556 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution successfully generate the required pattern for each test case. The task was straightforward, and the solutions are quite similar in their approach. Both solutions involve constructing a string of alternating '1's and '0's of length `K` and printing it `K` times for each test case.

Key insights from the official solution:
- The official solution uses a simple toggle mechanism with a variable `val` to alternate between '1' and '0'. This is a clean and efficient way to handle the alternation without using modulo operations.
- The official solution constructs the entire pattern string once and reuses it for printing, which is efficient in terms of string operations.

My solution used a nested loop to construct each line individually, which is slightly less efficient than constructing the string once and reusing it. However, both approaches are effective given the constraints.

Overall, the problem was simple, and both solutions are valid. The official solution offers a slightly more elegant way to handle the alternation of characters, which is a useful technique to remember for similar pattern generation tasks.
