Each line alternates between '1' and '0', starting with '1'. The number of characters in each line is equal to the line number (i.e., the first line has 1 character, the second line has 2 characters, etc.).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Read the number of test cases, \\( T \\).\n2. For each test case, read the integer \\( K \\).\n3. For each test case, generate \\( K \\) lines:\n   - For each line \\( i \\) (where \\( i \\) ranges from 1 to \\( K \\)), generate a string of length \\( i \\) that alternates between '1' and '0', starting with '1'.\n4. Print the generated pattern for each test case.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction generate_pattern(K):\n    for i from 1 to K:\n        line = \"\"\n        for j from 0 to i-1:\n            if j is even:\n                line += \"1\"\n            else:\n                line += \"0\"\n        print(line)\n\nread T\nfor each test case:\n    read K\n    generate_pattern(K)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(K):\n    for i in range(1, K + 1):\n        line = \"\"\n        for j in range(i):\n            if j % 2 == 0:\n                line += \"1\"\n            else:\n                line += \"0\"\n        print(line)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(T):\n        K = int(data[index])\n        generate_pattern(K)\n        index += 1\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **generate_pattern(K):** This function generates and prints the pattern for a given \\( K \\). It iterates from 1 to \\( K \\) to create each line. For each line, it alternates between '1' and '0' based on the index \\( j \\).\n  \n- **main():** This function handles input and output. It reads all input at once, splits it into a list, and processes each test case by calling `generate_pattern` with the appropriate \\( K \\). The `sys.stdin.read` is used to handle input efficiently for multiple test cases."

The pattern consists of `K` lines, where each line `i` (0-indexed) is constructed by:\n    - Counting down from `i` to `0`.\n    - Counting up from `1` to `i`.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n    Initially, the logic for generating each line of the pattern was implemented correctly. However, the main issue was with handling the output format, especially when dealing with multiple test cases. The output was not matching the expected format due to extra blank lines being printed between test cases.\n\n    #### Fixes and Lessons Learned\n    The key fix was to ensure that the output for each test case is printed correctly without extra blank lines. This was achieved by conditionally printing a blank line only between test cases, except after the last one. This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing output formatting, especially in problems involving multiple test cases.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n    The final solution correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the expected pattern for each `K`. The function `generate_pattern(K)` generates each line of the pattern, and the `main()` function manages input and output, ensuring the correct format. This approach can be applied to similar pattern generation problems in the future.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The number of lines and the number of characters in each line is determined by the value of `K`.\n\n### 2.

This type of problem is common in programming contests and coding interviews where understanding loops and conditionals is crucial. It can also be applied in situations where you need to create a visual representation of data or a sequence, such as in generating test cases, creating simple graphics, or simulating binary patterns.
