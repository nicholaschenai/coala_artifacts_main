    "raw_msg": "### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to generate a pattern based on an integer input `K` for multiple test cases. For each test case, the pattern consists of `K` lines. Each line should alternate between '1' and '0', starting with '1'. The number of lines and the number of characters in each line is determined by the value of `K`.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nFor each test case:\n- Read the integer `K`.\n- For each line from 1 to `K`:\n  - Generate a string of length `K` that alternates between '1' and '0', starting with '1'.\n  - Print this string.\n\nRepeat the above steps for each test case, ensuring that the output for each test case is separated correctly.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction generate_pattern(K):\n    for i from 1 to K:\n        pattern_line = \"\"\n        for j from 1 to K:\n            if j is odd:\n                pattern_line += \"1\"\n            else:\n                pattern_line += \"0\"\n        print pattern_line\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read K\n        generate_pattern(K)\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(K):\n    # Loop through each line from 1 to K\n    for i in range(1, K + 1):\n        # Initialize an empty string for the current line\n        pattern_line = \"\"\n        # Loop through each position in the line\n        for j in range(1, K + 1):\n            # Append '1' if the position is odd, '0' if even\n            if j % 2 == 1:\n                pattern_line += \"1\"\n            else:\n                pattern_line += \"0\"\n        # Print the constructed line\n        print(pattern_line)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    # Read all input at once\n    data = input().strip().split()\n    # First line is the number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    # For each test case, read K and generate the pattern\n    for t in range(T):\n        K = int(data[t + 1])\n        generate_pattern(K)\n        # Print a newline between test cases, but not after the last one\n        if t < T - 1:\n            print()\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the required pattern for each value of `K`. It ensures that the output format is correct by managing newlines between test cases.",
