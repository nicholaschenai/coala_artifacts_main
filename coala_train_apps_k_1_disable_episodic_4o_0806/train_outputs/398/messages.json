Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.\n\n## Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a prefix sum approach with a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of the number of times a particular prefix sum has occurred. The idea is to iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum (prefix sum). For each element, we check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current running sum, equals `k`. If such a prefix sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We count all such subarrays. We also update the hash map with the current prefix sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0\n   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle cases where subarray starts from index 0\n   Initialize `current_sum` to 0\n   Initialize `count` to 0\n\n   For each number `num` in `nums`:\n       Add `num` to `current_sum`\n       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`\n       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:\n           Add the count of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`\n       Increment the count of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`\n\n   Return `count`\n   ```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums\n        prefix_sum_count = {0: 1}\n        current_sum = 0\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each number in the array\n        for num in nums:\n            # Update the current prefix sum\n            current_sum += num\n            \n            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k\n            needed_sum = current_sum - k\n            \n            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are\n            # subarrays ending at the current index which sum to k\n            if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:\n                count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]\n            \n            # Update the prefix_sum_count with the current prefix sum\n            if current_sum in prefix_sum_count:\n                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1\n            else:\n                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] = 1\n        \n        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum equal to k\n        return count\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a prefix sum approach with a hash map to track the frequency of prefix sums. This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array."

The core concept here is the use of prefix sums to efficiently count subarrays with specific properties, which is a common pattern in problems involving subarray sums or counts.\n\n    The successful strategy involved using a dictionary to track the number of times each count of odd numbers has been encountered as we iterate through the array. This allows us to quickly determine how many subarrays end at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers by checking if there exists a prefix with `odd_count - k`.\n\n    Key steps included:\n    - Initializing a dictionary `prefix_counts` with a default entry for zero odd numbers to handle subarrays starting from the beginning.\n    - Iterating through the array, updating the count of odd numbers, and using the dictionary to count subarrays with the desired property.\n    - Incrementing the dictionary entry for the current count of odd numbers to keep track of all possible subarray configurations.\n\n    This approach efficiently handles the problem within the constraints, avoiding the need for nested loops that would be computationally expensive for large arrays.

This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it suitable for large input sizes.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Prefix Sum Concept**: The idea is to maintain a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array. This running sum is known as the prefix sum. By keeping track of these sums, we can determine if a subarray with the desired sum exists.\n\n2. **Hashmap for Frequency Counting**: A hashmap (or dictionary) is used to store the frequency of each prefix sum encountered. This allows us to quickly check if there exists a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, equals `k`. If such a prefix sum exists, it indicates that there is a subarray ending at the current index with a sum of `k`.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element is processed once, and dictionary operations (insertion and lookup) are average O(1). The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of prefix sums in the hashmap.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution aligns closely with the approach I initially conceptualized and implemented. Both solutions use the prefix sum and hashmap strategy effectively. The key takeaway is the power of using cumulative sums and hashmaps to solve subarray sum problems efficiently, avoiding the need for nested loops which would result in higher time complexity.\n\nThis problem reinforces the importance of understanding prefix sums and their applications in array-related problems, especially when dealing with subarray sums. The use of hashmaps to track frequencies of sums is a common and powerful technique in such scenarios."
