    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a prefix sum approach combined with a hashmap (dictionary). The idea is to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array. For each element, we calculate the cumulative sum up to that point. We then check if there is a previous cumulative sum that, when subtracted from the current cumulative sum, equals `k`. If such a previous sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We use a hashmap to store the frequency of each cumulative sum encountered so far, which allows us to quickly determine how many such subarrays exist.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` with a default value of 0 and set the count of sum 0 to 1.\n   Initialize `current_sum` to 0 and `count` to 0.\n   \n   For each number in the array:\n       Add the number to `current_sum`.\n       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`.\n       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`, add its count to `count`.\n       Increment the count of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`.\n   \n   Return `count`.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums\n        prefix_sum_count = {0: 1}\n        current_sum = 0\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through each number in the array\n        for num in nums:\n            # Update the current cumulative sum\n            current_sum += num\n            \n            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k\n            needed_sum = current_sum - k\n            \n            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are\n            # subarrays ending at the current index which sum to k\n            if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:\n                count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]\n            \n            # Update the frequency of the current cumulative sum in the dictionary\n            if current_sum in prefix_sum_count:\n                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1\n            else:\n                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] = 1\n        \n        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum equal to k\n        return count\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a prefix sum approach and a hashmap to track cumulative sums. This avoids the need for nested loops and works well within the problem's constraints.",
