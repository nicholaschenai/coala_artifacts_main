INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.

## Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a prefix sum approach with a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of the number of times a particular prefix sum has occurred. The idea is to iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum (prefix sum). For each element, we check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current running sum, equals `k`. If such a prefix sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We count all such subarrays. We also update the hash map with the current prefix sum.

## Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0
   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle cases where subarray starts from index 0
   Initialize `current_sum` to 0
   Initialize `count` to 0

   For each number `num` in `nums`:
       Add `num` to `current_sum`
       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`
       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:
           Add the count of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`
       Increment the count of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`

   Return `count`
   ```

## Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums
        prefix_sum_count = {0: 1}
        current_sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate over each number in the array
        for num in nums:
            # Update the current prefix sum
            current_sum += num
            
            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k
            needed_sum = current_sum - k
            
            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are
            # subarrays ending at the current index which sum to k
            if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:
                count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]
            
            # Update the prefix_sum_count with the current prefix sum
            if current_sum in prefix_sum_count:
                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1
            else:
                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] = 1
        
        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum equal to k
        return count
```

This solution efficiently finds the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a prefix sum approach with a hash map to track the frequency of prefix sums. This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within a given array that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums to efficiently count subarrays with specific properties, which is a common pattern in problems involving subarray sums or counts.

    The successful strategy involved using a dictionary to track the number of times each count of odd numbers has been encountered as we iterate through the array. This allows us to quickly determine how many subarrays end at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers by checking if there exists a prefix with `odd_count - k`.

    Key steps included:
    - Initializing a dictionary `prefix_counts` with a default entry for zero odd numbers to handle subarrays starting from the beginning.
    - Iterating through the array, updating the count of odd numbers, and using the dictionary to count subarrays with the desired property.
    - Incrementing the dictionary entry for the current count of odd numbers to keep track of all possible subarray configurations.

    This approach efficiently handles the problem within the constraints, avoiding the need for nested loops that would be computationally expensive for large arrays. The use of prefix sums and a dictionary for counting is a powerful technique for similar problems involving subarray properties.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a prefix sum approach combined with a hashmap (dictionary). The idea is to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array. For each element, we calculate the cumulative sum up to that point. We then check if there is a previous cumulative sum that, when subtracted from the current cumulative sum, equals `k`. If such a previous sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We use a hashmap to store the frequency of each cumulative sum encountered so far, which allows us to quickly determine how many such subarrays exist.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` with a default value of 0 and set the count of sum 0 to 1.
   Initialize `current_sum` to 0 and `count` to 0.
   
   For each number in the array:
       Add the number to `current_sum`.
       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`.
       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`, add its count to `count`.
       Increment the count of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`.
   
   Return `count`.

        prefix_sum_count = {0: 1}
        current_sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate through each number in the array
        for num in nums:

            current_sum += num
            
            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k
            needed_sum = current_sum - k
            
            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are
            # subarrays ending at the current index which sum to k

This solution efficiently finds the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a prefix sum approach and a hashmap to track cumulative sums. This avoids the need for nested loops and works well within the problem's constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums combined with a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays with the desired sum. This approach avoids the inefficiency of nested loops by leveraging the cumulative sum of elements and checking for previous sums that would form a subarray with the target sum `k`.

The strategy that worked involved maintaining a running total of the cumulative sum as we iterate through the array. For each element, we calculate the difference between the current cumulative sum and `k` to determine if there exists a previous cumulative sum that would result in a subarray summing to `k`. By storing these cumulative sums in a hashmap with their frequencies, we can quickly check and update the count of valid subarrays.

This problem reinforced the utility of prefix sums and hashmaps in solving subarray sum problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the prefix sum concept was applied, and no unexpected errors were encountered. The approach is optimal for the given constraints, handling large arrays and a wide range of integer values effectively.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

Example 1:

Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2



Note:

The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution

and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a prefix sum approach combined with a hashmap (dictionary). The idea is to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array. For each element, we calculate the cumulative sum up to that point. We then check if there is a previous cumulative sum that, when subtracted from the current cumulative sum, equals `k`. If such a previous sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We use a hashmap to store the frequency of each cumulative sum encountered so far, which allows us to quickly determine how many such subarrays exist.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` with a default value of 0 and set the count of sum 0 to 1.
   Initialize `current_sum` to 0 and `count` to 0.
   
   For each number in the array:
       Add the number to `current_sum`.
       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`.
       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`, add its count to `count`.
       Increment the count of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`.
   
   Return `count`.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums
        prefix_sum_count = {0: 1}
        current_sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate through each number in the array
        for num in nums:
            # Update the current cumulative sum
            current_sum += num
            
            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k
            needed_sum = current_sum - k
            
            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are
            # subarrays ending at the current index which sum to k
            if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:
                count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]
            
            # Update the frequency of the current cumulative sum in the dictionary
            if current_sum in prefix_sum_count:
                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1
            else:
                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] = 1
        
        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum equal to k
        return count
```

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] The problem of finding the number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals a given integer `k` is efficiently solved using a prefix sum approach combined with a hashmap. This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it suitable for large input sizes.

### Key Insights:

1. **Prefix Sum Concept**: The idea is to maintain a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array. This running sum is known as the prefix sum. By keeping track of these sums, we can determine if a subarray with the desired sum exists.

2. **Hashmap for Frequency Counting**: A hashmap (or dictionary) is used to store the frequency of each prefix sum encountered. This allows us to quickly check if there exists a previous prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, equals `k`. If such a prefix sum exists, it indicates that there is a subarray ending at the current index with a sum of `k`.

3. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element is processed once, and dictionary operations (insertion and lookup) are average O(1). The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of prefix sums in the hashmap.

### Reflection:

The official solution aligns closely with the approach I initially conceptualized and implemented. Both solutions use the prefix sum and hashmap strategy effectively. The key takeaway is the power of using cumulative sums and hashmaps to solve subarray sum problems efficiently, avoiding the need for nested loops which would result in higher time complexity.

This problem reinforces the importance of understanding prefix sums and their applications in array-related problems, especially when dealing with subarray sums. The use of hashmaps to track frequencies of sums is a common and powerful technique in such scenarios.

It uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of prefix sums encountered as it iterates through the list.
