INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given array `A` such that the sum of the subarray is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of potential starting points of subarrays. The idea is to maintain a prefix sum array and use it to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray. The deque will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.

### Steps:
1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the array from the start up to index `i-1`.
2. **Deque for Indices**: Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sum array. This will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray.
3. **Iterate Over Prefix Sum**: For each element in the prefix sum array:
   - Check if the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the index stored at the front of the deque is at least `K`. If it is, update the minimum length and remove the index from the deque.
   - Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums by removing indices from the back if the current prefix sum is less than or equal to the prefix sum at those indices.
   - Add the current index to the deque.
4. **Return Result**: If a valid subarray is found, return its length; otherwise, return `-1`.

## Pseudocode

```
function shortestSubarray(A, K):
    n = length of A
    prefix_sum = array of size n+1 initialized to 0
    for i from 0 to n:
        prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]
    
    deque = empty deque
    min_length = infinity
    
    for i from 0 to n:
        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= K:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - deque[0])
            remove front element from deque
        
        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]]:
            remove back element from deque
        
        add i to deque
    
    if min_length is infinity:
        return -1
    else:
        return min_length
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def shortestSubarray(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        n = len(A)
        # Step 1: Compute the prefix sum array
        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]
        
        # Step 2: Initialize a deque to store indices and a variable for the minimum length
        dq = deque()
        min_length = float('inf')
        
        # Step 3: Iterate over the prefix sum array
        for i in range(n + 1):
            # Check if we can form a valid subarray with sum at least K
            while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:
                min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())
            
            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums
            while dq and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:
                dq.pop()
            
            # Add the current index to the deque
            dq.append(i)
        
        # Step 4: Return the result
        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1
```

This solution efficiently finds the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K` using a combination of prefix sums and a deque to maintain potential starting indices. The time complexity is O(n) due to the linear traversal and deque operations.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given array `A` such that the sum of its elements is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of potential starting points of subarrays. The idea is to maintain a running sum of the elements and use the deque to store indices of the prefix sums in increasing order. This allows us to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.

### Steps:
1. Compute the prefix sum array `P` where `P[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A`.
2. Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sums in increasing order.
3. Iterate through the prefix sum array:
   - For each prefix sum `P[j]`, check if there is an index `i` in the deque such that `P[j] - P[i] >= K`. If so, update the minimum length of the subarray.
   - Maintain the deque such that the prefix sums are in increasing order by removing indices from the back if the current prefix sum is smaller.
   - Add the current index to the deque.
4. Return the minimum length found, or `-1` if no valid subarray is found.

## Pseudocode

```
function shortestSubarray(A, K):
    n = length of A
    P = array of size n+1 initialized to 0
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        P[i+1] = P[i] + A[i]
    
    deque = empty deque
    min_length = infinity
    
    for j from 0 to n:
        while deque is not empty and P[j] - P[deque[0]] >= K:
            min_length = min(min_length, j - deque[0])
            remove front element from deque
        
        while deque is not empty and P[j] <= P[deque[-1]]:
            remove back element from deque
        
        add j to deque
    
    if min_length is infinity:
        return -1
    else:
        return min_length
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def shortestSubarray(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        n = len(A)
        P = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # Compute prefix sums
        for i in range(n):
            P[i + 1] = P[i] + A[i]
        
        # Deque to store indices of the prefix sums
        dq = deque()
        min_length = float('inf')
        
        for j in range(n + 1):
            # Check if we can find a valid subarray
            while dq and P[j] - P[dq[0]] >= K:
                min_length = min(min_length, j - dq.popleft())
            
            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums
            while dq and P[j] <= P[dq[-1]]:

INFO - [Task id] 312 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given array `A` such that the sum of its elements is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of potential starting points of subarrays. The idea is to maintain a running sum of the elements and use the deque to store indices of the prefix sums in increasing order. This allows us to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.

### Steps:
1. Compute the prefix sum array `P` where `P[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A`.
2. Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sums in increasing order.
3. Iterate through the prefix sum array:
   - For each prefix sum `P[j]`, check if there is an index `i` in the deque such that `P[j] - P[i] >= K`. If so, update the minimum length of the subarray.
   - Maintain the deque such that the prefix sums are in increasing order by removing indices from the back if the current prefix sum is smaller.
   - Add the current index to the deque.
4. Return the minimum length found, or `-1` if no valid subarray is found.

## Pseudocode

```
function shortestSubarray(A, K):
    n = length of A
    P = array of size n+1 initialized to 0
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        P[i+1] = P[i] + A[i]
    
    deque = empty deque
    min_length = infinity
    
    for j from 0 to n:
        while deque is not empty and P[j] - P[deque[0]] >= K:
            min_length = min(min_length, j - deque[0])
            remove front element from deque
        
        while deque is not empty and P[j] <= P[deque[-1]]:
            remove back element from deque
        
        add j to deque
    
    if min_length is infinity:
        return -1
    else:
        return min_length
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def shortestSubarray(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        n = len(A)
        P = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # Compute prefix sums
        for i in range(n):
            P[i + 1] = P[i] + A[i]
        
        # Deque to store indices of the prefix sums
        dq = deque()
        min_length = float('inf')
        
        for j in range(n + 1):
            # Check if we can find a valid subarray
            while dq and P[j] - P[dq[0]] >= K:
                min_length = min(min_length, j - dq.popleft())
            
            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums
            while dq and P[j] <= P[dq[-1]]:
                dq.pop()
            
            # Add current index to the deque
            dq.append(j)
        
        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1
```

This solution efficiently finds the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K` using a sliding window approach with a deque, ensuring optimal time complexity.

INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum at least `K`. The challenge was to do this efficiently given the constraints, where the array length could be up to 50,000. 

The core concept leveraged here was the use of prefix sums combined with a sliding window approach using a deque. The prefix sum array allowed us to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray, and the deque helped maintain potential starting indices of subarrays in an efficient manner. This approach ensures that we can find the shortest subarray in linear time, which is crucial for handling large input sizes.

The strategy involved:
1. Calculating prefix sums to facilitate quick subarray sum calculations.
2. Using a deque to store indices of prefix sums in increasing order, allowing us to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.
3. Iterating through the prefix sums and updating the minimum subarray length whenever a valid subarray was found.

This approach worked well and passed all test cases, demonstrating its efficiency and correctness. The key takeaway is the power of combining prefix sums with a deque to solve subarray problems efficiently. This pattern is useful for similar problems where subarray sums need to be calculated and optimized.

INFO - [Task id] 312 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given array `A` such that the sum of its elements is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of potential starting points of subarrays. The idea is to maintain a running sum of the elements and use the deque to store indices of the prefix sums in increasing order. This allows us to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.

### Steps:
1. Compute the prefix sum array `P` where `P[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A`.
2. Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sums in increasing order.
3. Iterate through the prefix sum array:
   - For each prefix sum `P[j]`, check if there is an index `i` in the deque such that `P[j] - P[i] >= K`. If so, update the minimum length of the subarray.
   - Maintain the deque such that the prefix sums are in increasing order by removing indices from the back if the current prefix sum is smaller.
   - Add the current index to the deque.
4. Return the minimum length found, or `-1` if no valid subarray is found.

## Pseudocode

```
function shortestSubarray(A, K):
    n = length of A
    P = array of size n+1 initialized to 0
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        P[i+1] = P[i] + A[i]
    
    deque = empty deque
    min_length = infinity
    
    for j from 0 to n:
        while deque is not empty and P[j] - P[deque[0]] >= K:
            min_length = min(min_length, j - deque[0])
            remove front element from deque
        
        while deque is not empty and P[j] <= P[deque[-1]]:
            remove back element from deque
        
        add j to deque
    
    if min_length is infinity:
        return -1
    else:
        return min_length
```

        dq = deque()
        min_length = float('inf')
        
        for j in range(n + 1):
            # Check if we can find a valid subarray
            while dq and P[j] - P[dq[0]] >= K:

            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums

INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] The official solution and my solution both use a similar approach involving prefix sums and a deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`. Here are some key insights and reflections from this problem-solving experience:

1. **Prefix Sum and Deque Approach**: Both solutions utilize the concept of prefix sums to transform the problem of finding a subarray with a certain sum into a problem of finding two indices with a certain difference. The deque is used to maintain a list of potential starting indices for subarrays in a way that allows efficient checking and updating.

2. **Handling Negative Numbers**: The official solution explicitly handles negative numbers by removing any greater cumulative sums from the deque when a negative number is encountered. This ensures that the deque only contains indices that could potentially lead to a shorter subarray. My solution implicitly handles this by maintaining the deque in increasing order of prefix sums.

3. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient, operating in O(n) time complexity due to the single pass through the array and the efficient operations on the deque. This is crucial given the constraints of the problem.

4. **Edge Cases**: The official solution includes a check to return `-1` if no valid subarray is found by comparing the result with the length of the array. This is a straightforward way to handle cases where no subarray meets the criteria.

Overall, the problem reinforces the utility of prefix sums and deques in solving subarray problems efficiently. The official solution provides a slightly different perspective on handling negative numbers, which can be a useful consideration in similar problems.
