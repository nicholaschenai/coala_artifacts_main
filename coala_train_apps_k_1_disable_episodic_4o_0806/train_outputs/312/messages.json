If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of potential starting points of subarrays. The idea is to maintain a prefix sum array and use it to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray. The deque will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the array from the start up to index `i-1`.\n2. **Deque for Indices**: Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sum array. This will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray.\n3. **Iterate Over Prefix Sum**: For each element in the prefix sum array:\n   - Check if the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the index stored at the front of the deque is at least `K`. If it is, update the minimum length and remove the index from the deque.\n   - Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums by removing indices from the back if the current prefix sum is less than or equal to the prefix sum at those indices.\n   - Add the current index to the deque.\n4. **Return Result**: If a valid subarray is found, return its length; otherwise, return `-1`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction shortestSubarray(A, K):\n    n = length of A\n    prefix_sum = array of size n+1 initialized to 0\n    for i from 0 to n:\n        prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n    \n    deque = empty deque\n    min_length = infinity\n    \n    for i from 0 to n:\n        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= K:\n            min_length = min(min_length, i - deque[0])\n            remove front element from deque\n        \n        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]]:\n            remove back element from deque\n        \n        add i to deque\n    \n    if min_length is infinity:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return min_length\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubarray(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:\n        n = len(A)\n        # Step 1: Compute the prefix sum array\n        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n        \n        # Step 2: Initialize a deque to store indices and a variable for the minimum length\n        dq = deque()\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        \n        # Step 3: Iterate over the prefix sum array\n        for i in range(n + 1):\n            # Check if we can form a valid subarray with sum at least K\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:\n                min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())\n            \n            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:\n                dq.pop()\n            \n            # Add the current index to the deque\n            dq.append(i)\n        \n        # Step 4: Return the result\n        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K` using a combination of prefix sums and a deque to maintain potential starting indices.

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are some key insights and reflections from this problem-solving experience:\n\n1. **Prefix Sum and Deque Approach**: Both solutions utilize the concept of prefix sums to transform the problem of finding a subarray with a certain sum into a problem of finding two indices with a certain difference. The deque is used to maintain a list of potential starting indices for subarrays in a way that allows efficient checking and updating.\n\n2. **Handling Negative Numbers**: The official solution explicitly handles negative numbers by removing any greater cumulative sums from the deque when a negative number is encountered. This ensures that the deque only contains indices that could potentially lead to a shorter subarray. My solution implicitly handles this by maintaining the deque in increasing order of prefix sums.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient, operating in O(n) time complexity due to the single pass through the array and the efficient operations on the deque. This is crucial given the constraints of the problem.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: The official solution includes a check to return `-1` if no valid subarray is found by comparing the result with the length of the array. This is a straightforward way to handle cases where no subarray meets the criteria.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforces the utility of prefix sums and deques in solving subarray problems efficiently.
