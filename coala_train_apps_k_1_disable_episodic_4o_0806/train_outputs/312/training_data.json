    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum at least `K`. The challenge was to do this efficiently given the constraints, where the array length could be up to 50,000. \n\nThe core concept leveraged here was the use of prefix sums combined with a sliding window approach using a deque. The prefix sum array allowed us to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray, and the deque helped maintain potential starting indices of subarrays in an efficient manner. This approach ensures that we can find the shortest subarray in linear time, which is crucial for handling large input sizes.\n\nThe strategy involved:\n1. Calculating prefix sums to facilitate quick subarray sum calculations.\n2. Using a deque to store indices of prefix sums in increasing order, allowing us to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.\n3. Iterating through the prefix sums and updating the minimum subarray length whenever a valid subarray was found.\n\nThis approach worked well and passed all test cases, demonstrating its efficiency and correctness. The key takeaway is the power of combining prefix sums with a deque to solve subarray problems efficiently. This pattern is useful for similar problems where subarray sums need to be calculated and optimized.",
    "reflection": "The official solution and my solution both use a similar approach involving prefix sums and a deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`. Here are some key insights and reflections from this problem-solving experience:\n\n1. **Prefix Sum and Deque Approach**: Both solutions utilize the concept of prefix sums to transform the problem of finding a subarray with a certain sum into a problem of finding two indices with a certain difference. The deque is used to maintain a list of potential starting indices for subarrays in a way that allows efficient checking and updating.\n\n2. **Handling Negative Numbers**: The official solution explicitly handles negative numbers by removing any greater cumulative sums from the deque when a negative number is encountered. This ensures that the deque only contains indices that could potentially lead to a shorter subarray. My solution implicitly handles this by maintaining the deque in increasing order of prefix sums.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient, operating in O(n) time complexity due to the single pass through the array and the efficient operations on the deque. This is crucial given the constraints of the problem.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: The official solution includes a check to return `-1` if no valid subarray is found by comparing the result with the length of the array. This is a straightforward way to handle cases where no subarray meets the criteria.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforces the utility of prefix sums and deques in solving subarray problems efficiently. The official solution provides a slightly different perspective on handling negative numbers, which can be a useful consideration in similar problems.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThe function finds the length of the shortest contiguous subarray whose sum is at least a given integer \\( K \\). It first computes the prefix sums of the input array \\( A \\) and uses a deque to efficiently track potential starting indices of subarrays. As it iterates through the prefix sums, it checks if the difference between the current prefix sum and the smallest prefix sum in the deque is at least \\( K \\), updating the minimum subarray length if so. The deque is maintained in increasing order of prefix sums to ensure that the smallest possible subarray is found. If a valid subarray is found, the function returns its length; otherwise, it returns \\(-1\\).\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to find the shortest subarray with a sum constraint, which is a common problem in competitive programming and algorithm design. The solution uses the prefix sum technique combined with a deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least K. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large arrays, as it optimizes the search process by maintaining a sliding window of potential subarray start points. Understanding this pattern can help in solving similar problems where you need to find subarrays with specific sum properties, especially when the array size is large and a brute force approach would be inefficient."
