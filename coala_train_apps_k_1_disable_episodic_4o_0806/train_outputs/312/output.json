    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given array `A` such that the sum of its elements is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of potential starting points of subarrays. The idea is to maintain a running sum of the elements and use the deque to store indices of the prefix sums in increasing order. This allows us to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Compute the prefix sum array `P` where `P[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `A`.\n2. Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sums in increasing order.\n3. Iterate through the prefix sum array:\n   - For each prefix sum `P[j]`, check if there is an index `i` in the deque such that `P[j] - P[i] >= K`. If so, update the minimum length of the subarray.\n   - Maintain the deque such that the prefix sums are in increasing order by removing indices from the back if the current prefix sum is smaller.\n   - Add the current index to the deque.\n4. Return the minimum length found, or `-1` if no valid subarray is found.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction shortestSubarray(A, K):\n    n = length of A\n    P = array of size n+1 initialized to 0\n    for i from 0 to n-1:\n        P[i+1] = P[i] + A[i]\n    \n    deque = empty deque\n    min_length = infinity\n    \n    for j from 0 to n:\n        while deque is not empty and P[j] - P[deque[0]] >= K:\n            min_length = min(min_length, j - deque[0])\n            remove front element from deque\n        \n        while deque is not empty and P[j] <= P[deque[-1]]:\n            remove back element from deque\n        \n        add j to deque\n    \n    if min_length is infinity:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return min_length\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubarray(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:\n        n = len(A)\n        P = [0] * (n + 1)\n        \n        # Compute prefix sums\n        for i in range(n):\n            P[i + 1] = P[i] + A[i]\n        \n        # Deque to store indices of the prefix sums\n        dq = deque()\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        \n        for j in range(n + 1):\n            # Check if we can find a valid subarray\n            while dq and P[j] - P[dq[0]] >= K:\n                min_length = min(min_length, j - dq.popleft())\n            \n            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums\n            while dq and P[j] <= P[dq[-1]]:\n                dq.pop()\n            \n            # Add current index to the deque\n            dq.append(j)\n        \n        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K` using a sliding window approach with a deque, ensuring optimal time complexity.",
