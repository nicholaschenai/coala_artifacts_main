The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.\nThe area is of dimension $N$ x $N$\nThe whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.\nThis is a SAFE example:\n1 0\n0 1\nThis is an UNSAFE example:\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nTo avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.\nReturn an output of \"SAFE\" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return \"UNSAFE\" otherwise.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Next line contains $N$.\n- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as \"UNSAFE\".\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n- $0 \\leq Ai \\leq 1$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 100$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- 30 points : $1 \\leq N \\leq 7$\n- 70 points : Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n4\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n4\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\nSAFE\nUNSAFE\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nBeds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\". An arrangement is considered \"SAFE\" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If any two beds are adjacent in any of these directions, the arrangement is \"UNSAFE\". We need to perform this check for multiple test cases.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. For each test case, read the grid dimensions \\( N \\) and the grid itself.\n2. For each cell in the grid that contains a bed (value 1), check its adjacent cells in all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).\n3. If any adjacent cell also contains a bed, mark the arrangement as \"UNSAFE\" and break out of the loop for that test case.\n4. If no adjacent beds are found for any bed in the grid, mark the arrangement as \"SAFE\".\n5.

This insight allowed for a more direct approach rather than iterating over all possible boxes.\n\n    2. **Efficient Calculation**: The official solution leverages the mathematical property of perfect squares and uses integer division and square root calculations to directly compute the number of rooms that can be tiled. This approach is both time-efficient and straightforward, reducing the complexity from iterating over all numbers up to `N` to simply calculating the integer square root of `N/2`.\n\n    3. **Simplifying the Problem**: By dividing `N` by 2 upfront, the problem is simplified to finding how many perfect squares exist up to `N/2`. This simplification is a powerful technique in problem-solving, where reducing the problem space can lead to more efficient solutions.\n\n    4. **Python Built-ins**: The use of Python's built-in functions like `int()` for floor division and `**0.5` for square root calculations demonstrates the importance of understanding and utilizing language features to write concise and efficient code.\n\n    Overall, the official solution provided a more elegant and efficient approach than my initial attempts, highlighting the importance of mathematical insights and simplification in algorithm design.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The key pattern is recognizing that for \\( N > 3 \\), the number of valid schedules can be expressed using a formula involving powers of 3, due to the constraints on dish selection.\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n    Initially, the strategy was to use a straightforward formula: \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\). The use of fast exponentiation with the `pow` function was correct, but the application of the modulo operation needed careful attention. The error was in not correctly applying the modulo operation to the entire expression, which led to incorrect results for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\n    #### Fixes and Insights\n    The solution was fixed by ensuring that the modulo operation was applied to the entire calculation, especially when dealing with large powers. The `pow` function was used to efficiently compute \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\mod (10^9 + 7) \\). This experience reinforced the importance of correctly applying modulo operations in problems involving large numbers and exponentiation.\n\n    #### Final Correct Code\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return (4 * 3) % MOD\n        elif N == 3:\n            return (4 * 3 * 2) % MOD\n        else:\n            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)\n            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = calculate_schedules(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This code correctly computes the number of valid schedules for each test case, taking into account the constraints and using modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) to handle large numbers.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

My initial approach incorrectly included diagonal checks, which led to incorrect results. The key insight was to focus only on horizontal and vertical adjacency, as diagonal adjacency is allowed.\n\n#### Key Learnings:\n\n1. **Understanding Problem Constraints**: It's crucial to carefully read and understand the problem constraints.
