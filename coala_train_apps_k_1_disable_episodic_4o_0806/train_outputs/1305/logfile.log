## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If any two beds are adjacent in any of these directions, the arrangement is "UNSAFE". We need to perform this check for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each test case, read the grid dimensions \( N \) and the grid itself.
2. For each cell in the grid that contains a bed (value 1), check its adjacent cells in all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).
3. If any adjacent cell also contains a bed, mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE" and break out of the loop for that test case.
4. If no adjacent beds are found for any bed in the grid, mark the arrangement as "SAFE".
5. Repeat the above steps for all test cases and output the result for each.

## Pseudocode

```
function check_safety(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (di, dj) in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)]:
                ni = i + di
                nj = j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read grid of size N x N
        result = check_safety(grid, N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_safety(grid, N):
    # Directions for adjacent cells: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all adjacent cells
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = check_safety(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the bed arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", and outputs the result for each test case. The `check_safety` function checks all possible adjacent positions for each bed to ensure no two beds are adjacent.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, I gained several insights that could be useful for future challenges:

    1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The key to solving this problem efficiently was recognizing that the task was essentially about finding perfect squares that could be doubled to fit within the given `N`. This insight allowed for a more direct approach rather than iterating over all possible boxes.

    2. **Efficient Calculation**: The official solution leverages the mathematical property of perfect squares and uses integer division and square root calculations to directly compute the number of rooms that can be tiled. This approach is both time-efficient and straightforward, reducing the complexity from iterating over all numbers up to `N` to simply calculating the integer square root of `N/2`.

    3. **Simplifying the Problem**: By dividing `N` by 2 upfront, the problem is simplified to finding how many perfect squares exist up to `N/2`. This simplification is a powerful technique in problem-solving, where reducing the problem space can lead to more efficient solutions.

    4. **Python Built-ins**: The use of Python's built-in functions like `int()` for floor division and `**0.5` for square root calculations demonstrates the importance of understanding and utilizing language features to write concise and efficient code.

    Overall, the official solution provided a more elegant and efficient approach than my initial attempts, highlighting the importance of mathematical insights and simplification in algorithm design.

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the size \( N \) and the \( N \times N \) grid.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). For each such cell, ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, mark the grid as "UNSAFE".

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if no unsafe conditions are found, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (up, down, left, right, diagonals):

    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the grid is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", and outputs the result for each test case. The `is_safe` function checks each bed's surroundings to ensure no adjacent beds violate the safety condition.

The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the size \( N \) and the \( N \times N \) grid.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). For each such cell, ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, mark the grid as "UNSAFE".

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if no unsafe conditions are found, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (up, down, left, right, diagonals):
                if adjacent cell in direction is within bounds and has a bed:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read grid of size N x N
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the grid is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", and outputs the result for each test case. The `is_safe` function checks each bed's surroundings to ensure no adjacent beds violate the safety condition.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script that reads from standard input, the `main()` function should be called explicitly to execute the logic.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings. This approach is correct, but we need to ensure that the index is managed properly to parse the input correctly.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This part seems correct, but since the `main()` function is not called, no output is generated.

4. **Environment Feedback**: The feedback indicates that no output was detected, which aligns with the issue of not calling the `main()` function.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed. Let's update the solution accordingly.

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Function Call**: Added a conditional `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed. This will trigger the input reading and processing logic.
- **Input Handling**: The input handling logic remains the same, as it correctly parses the input into a list of strings and processes each test case.
- **Output**: The results are printed after processing all test cases, which should now work correctly since the `main()` function is called. 

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected.

Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

### Explanation:
- **Function Call**: The `main()` function is now called using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct, which ensures that the script executes the main logic when run.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, split into a list of strings, and processed to extract the number of test cases and each grid.
- **Safety Check**: The `is_safe` function checks each cell with a bed and its adjacent cells to determine if the arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".
- **Output**: The results for each test case are printed after processing all test cases. 

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected and ensure the program functions as intended.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the size \( N \) and the \( N \times N \) grid.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). For each such cell, ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, mark the grid as "UNSAFE".

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if no unsafe conditions are found, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (up, down, left, right, diagonals):
                if adjacent cell in direction is within bounds and has a bed:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read grid of size N x N
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the grid is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", and outputs the result for each test case. The `is_safe` function checks each bed's surroundings to ensure no adjacent beds violate the safety condition.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script that reads from standard input, the `main()` function should be called explicitly to execute the logic.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings. This approach is correct, but we need to ensure that the index is managed properly to parse the input correctly.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This part seems correct, but since the `main()` function is not called, no output is generated.

4. **Environment Feedback**: The feedback indicates that no output was detected, which aligns with the issue of not calling the `main()` function.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed. Let's update the solution accordingly.

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]

                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Function Call**: Added a conditional `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed. This will trigger the input reading and processing logic.
- **Input Handling**: The input handling logic remains the same, as it correctly parses the input into a list of strings and processes each test case.
- **Output**: The results are printed after processing all test cases, which should now work correctly since the `main()` function is called. 

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Diagonal Safety**: The problem states that beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe. However, the current solution considers diagonal adjacency as unsafe, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

2. **Direction Handling**: The current solution checks all eight possible directions (including diagonals) for adjacency, which leads to marking diagonally adjacent beds as "UNSAFE".

3. **Output**: The solution outputs "UNSAFE" for both test cases because it incorrectly considers diagonal adjacency as unsafe.

### Steps to Correct the Solution:

1. **Adjust Direction Checks**: Modify the direction checks to only consider horizontal and vertical adjacency as unsafe. Diagonal adjacency should not be checked.

2. **Re-evaluate the Safety Check**: Ensure that the `is_safe` function only returns "UNSAFE" if there are horizontally or vertically adjacent beds.

Let's update the solution to address these issues.

```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Direction Handling**: Updated the `directions` list to only include horizontal and vertical directions, removing diagonal checks.
- **Safety Check**: The `is_safe` function now correctly identifies unsafe conditions based only on horizontal and vertical adjacency, aligning with the problem's requirements.

This should resolve the issue and produce the correct output for the given test cases.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the size \( N \) and the \( N \times N \) grid.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). For each such cell, ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, mark the grid as "UNSAFE".

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if no unsafe conditions are found, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (up, down, left, right, diagonals):
                if adjacent cell in direction is within bounds and has a bed:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read grid of size N x N
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the grid is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", and outputs the result for each test case. The `is_safe` function checks each bed's surroundings to ensure no adjacent beds violate the safety condition.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script that reads from standard input, the `main()` function should be called explicitly to execute the logic.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings. This approach is correct, but we need to ensure that the index is managed properly to parse the input correctly.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This part seems correct, but since the `main()` function is not called, no output is generated.

4. **Environment Feedback**: The feedback indicates that no output was detected, which aligns with the issue of not calling the `main()` function.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed. Let's update the solution accordingly.

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Function Call**: Added a conditional `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed. This will trigger the input reading and processing logic.
- **Input Handling**: The input handling logic remains the same, as it correctly parses the input into a list of strings and processes each test case.
- **Output**: The results are printed after processing all test cases, which should now work correctly since the `main()` function is called. 

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected.

- **Safety Check**: The `is_safe` function checks each cell with a bed and its adjacent cells to determine if the arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".
- **Output**: The results for each test case are printed after processing all test cases. 

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected and ensure the program functions as intended.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Diagonal Safety**: The problem states that beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe. However, the current solution considers diagonal adjacency as unsafe, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

2. **Direction Handling**: The current solution checks all eight possible directions (including diagonals) for adjacency, which leads to marking diagonally adjacent beds as "UNSAFE".

3. **Output**: The solution outputs "UNSAFE" for both test cases because it incorrectly considers diagonal adjacency as unsafe.

### Steps to Correct the Solution:

1. **Adjust Direction Checks**: Modify the direction checks to only consider horizontal and vertical adjacency as unsafe. Diagonal adjacency should not be checked.

2. **Re-evaluate the Safety Check**: Ensure that the `is_safe` function only returns "UNSAFE" if there are horizontally or vertically adjacent beds.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, with constraints on consecutive days and the first and last day. The key pattern is recognizing that for \( N > 3 \), the number of valid schedules can be expressed using a formula involving powers of 3, due to the constraints on dish selection.

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the strategy was to use a straightforward formula: \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \). The use of fast exponentiation with the `pow` function was correct, but the application of the modulo operation needed careful attention. The error was in not correctly applying the modulo operation to the entire expression, which led to incorrect results for larger values of \( N \).

    #### Fixes and Insights
    The solution was fixed by ensuring that the modulo operation was applied to the entire calculation, especially when dealing with large powers. The `pow` function was used to efficiently compute \( 3^{(N-2)} \mod (10^9 + 7) \). This experience reinforced the importance of correctly applying modulo operations in problems involving large numbers and exponentiation.

    #### Final Correct Code
    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return (4 * 3) % MOD
        elif N == 3:
            return (4 * 3 * 2) % MOD
        else:
            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)
            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    main()
    ```

    This code correctly computes the number of valid schedules for each test case, taking into account the constraints and using modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

### Explanation:
- **Direction Handling**: The `directions` list now only includes horizontal and vertical directions, which are the only ones that should be checked for adjacency according to the problem statement.
- **Safety Check**: The `is_safe` function checks each cell with a bed and its horizontal and vertical neighbors to determine if the arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".
- **Output**: The results for each test case are printed after processing all test cases, ensuring the correct output is generated. 

This should resolve the issue and produce the correct output for the given test cases.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the size \( N \) and the \( N \times N \) grid.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). For each such cell, ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, mark the grid as "UNSAFE".

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if no unsafe conditions are found, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (up, down, left, right, diagonals):
                if adjacent cell in direction is within bounds and has a bed:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read grid of size N x N
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the grid is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", and outputs the result for each test case. The `is_safe` function checks each bed's surroundings to ensure no adjacent beds violate the safety condition.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script that reads from standard input, the `main()` function should be called explicitly to execute the logic.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings. This approach is correct, but we need to ensure that the index is managed properly to parse the input correctly.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This part seems correct, but since the `main()` function is not called, no output is generated.

4. **Environment Feedback**: The feedback indicates that no output was detected, which aligns with the issue of not calling the `main()` function.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed. Let's update the solution accordingly.

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):

        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Function Call**: Added a conditional `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed. This will trigger the input reading and processing logic.
- **Input Handling**: The input handling logic remains the same, as it correctly parses the input into a list of strings and processes each test case.
- **Output**: The results are printed after processing all test cases, which should now work correctly since the `main()` function is called. 

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected.

- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, split into a list of strings, and processed to extract the number of test cases and each grid.
- **Safety Check**: The `is_safe` function checks each cell with a bed and its adjacent cells to determine if the arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".
- **Output**: The results for each test case are printed after processing all test cases. 

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected and ensure the program functions as intended.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Diagonal Safety**: The problem states that beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe. However, the current solution considers diagonal adjacency as unsafe, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

2. **Direction Handling**: The current solution checks all eight possible directions (including diagonals) for adjacency, which leads to marking diagonally adjacent beds as "UNSAFE".

3. **Output**: The solution outputs "UNSAFE" for both test cases because it incorrectly considers diagonal adjacency as unsafe.

### Steps to Correct the Solution:

1. **Adjust Direction Checks**: Modify the direction checks to only consider horizontal and vertical adjacency as unsafe. Diagonal adjacency should not be checked.

2. **Re-evaluate the Safety Check**: Ensure that the `is_safe` function only returns "UNSAFE" if there are horizontally or vertically adjacent beds.

Let's update the solution to address these issues.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] In tackling the problem of determining whether a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", the key concept was understanding adjacency rules. The problem required checking for horizontal and vertical adjacency of beds, while allowing diagonal adjacency. Initially, the solution incorrectly considered diagonal adjacency as unsafe, leading to incorrect results.

### Key Learnings:

1. **Direction Handling**: The initial mistake was including diagonal directions in the adjacency check. The correct approach was to only consider horizontal and vertical directions, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

2. **Function Execution**: Another issue was not calling the `main()` function, which resulted in no output. This was fixed by using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct to ensure the function is executed when the script runs.

3. **Input and Output**: Properly parsing input and managing indices was crucial for handling multiple test cases. The solution involved reading all input at once, splitting it into manageable parts, and iterating over each test case.

### Final Solution:

The final solution involved defining a function `is_safe` that checks each bed's horizontal and vertical neighbors for adjacency. The `main()` function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result. This approach successfully passed all test cases by adhering to the problem's adjacency rules.

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This experience reinforced the importance of carefully interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the code logic aligns with those constraints. It also highlighted the need for proper function execution and input handling in competitive programming scenarios.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$

1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the size \( N \) and the \( N \times N \) grid.

2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). For each such cell, ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, mark the grid as "UNSAFE".

3. **Output**: For each test case, output "SAFE" if no unsafe conditions are found, otherwise output "UNSAFE".

## Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (up, down, left, right, diagonals):
                if adjacent cell in direction is within bounds and has a bed:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read grid of size N x N
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the grid is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", and outputs the result for each test case. The `is_safe` function checks each bed's surroundings to ensure no adjacent beds violate the safety condition.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script that reads from standard input, the `main()` function should be called explicitly to execute the logic.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings. This approach is correct, but we need to ensure that the index is managed properly to parse the input correctly.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This part seems correct, but since the `main()` function is not called, no output is generated.

4. **Environment Feedback**: The feedback indicates that no output was detected, which aligns with the issue of not calling the `main()` function.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed. Let's update the solution accordingly.

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Function Call**: Added a conditional `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure that the `main()` function is called when the script is executed. This will trigger the input reading and processing logic.
- **Input Handling**: The input handling logic remains the same, as it correctly parses the input into a list of strings and processes each test case.
- **Output**: The results are printed after processing all test cases, which should now work correctly since the `main()` function is called. 

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Diagonal Safety**: The problem states that beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe. However, the current solution considers diagonal adjacency as unsafe, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

2. **Direction Handling**: The current solution checks all eight possible directions (including diagonals) for adjacency, which leads to marking diagonally adjacent beds as "UNSAFE".

3. **Output**: The solution outputs "UNSAFE" for both test cases because it incorrectly considers diagonal adjacency as unsafe.

### Steps to Correct the Solution:

1. **Adjust Direction Checks**: Modify the direction checks to only consider horizontal and vertical adjacency as unsafe. Diagonal adjacency should not be checked.

2. **Re-evaluate the Safety Check**: Ensure that the `is_safe` function only returns "UNSAFE" if there are horizontally or vertically adjacent beds.

The problem required checking a grid for unsafe bed placements, where beds should not be adjacent horizontally or vertically. My initial approach incorrectly included diagonal checks, which led to incorrect results. The key insight was to focus only on horizontal and vertical adjacency, as diagonal adjacency is allowed.

#### Key Learnings:

1. **Understanding Problem Constraints**: It's crucial to carefully read and understand the problem constraints. In this case, the problem explicitly allowed diagonal adjacency, which I initially overlooked.

2. **Direction Handling**: The official solution efficiently checks for horizontal and vertical adjacency by iterating through the grid and checking adjacent cells. This approach is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.

3. **Flag Usage for Early Exit**: The official solution uses a flag to break out of loops early once an unsafe condition is detected. This is an efficient way to stop further checks once the result is determined, saving computational resources.

4. **Iterative Input Handling**: The official solution reads input iteratively and processes each test case in a loop, which is a common pattern for handling multiple test cases in competitive programming.

#### Code Snippet:

The official solution's approach can be summarized as follows:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    lst = []
    flag = 0
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        lst.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    for i in lst:
        for j in range(n-1):
            if i[j] == i[j+1] == 1:
                res.append("UNSAFE")
                flag = 1
                break
        if flag != 0:
            break
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(n):
            if lst[i][j] == lst[i+1][j] == 1:
                res.append("UNSAFE")
                flag = 1
                break
        if flag != 0:
            break
    if flag == 0:
        res.append("SAFE")
for i in res:
    print(i)
```

This experience reinforced the importance of correctly interpreting problem requirements and efficiently implementing solutions by focusing on the necessary checks.

The problem required checking a grid for unsafe bed placements, where beds should not be adjacent horizontally or vertically. My initial approach incorrectly included diagonal checks, which led to incorrect results. The key insight was to focus only on horizontal and vertical adja...,

The main function is `main`.
INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes multiple test cases, each specifying the size of a grid and the grid itself. It processes each test case by constructing a grid of integers and then checks if any adjacent cells in the grid contain the value 1, indicating an "UNSAFE" condition. If no such adjacent cells are found, the grid is considered "SAFE". The results for each test case are collected and printed sequentially.

[Problem]
    Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
    The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
    The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
    This is a SAFE example:
    1 0
    0 1
    This is an UNSAFE example:
    0 1 1
    0 0 0
    1 0 0
    To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
    Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Next line contains $N$.
    - Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
    - $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
    - $2 \leq N \leq 100$

    -----Subtasks-----
    - 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
    - 70 points : Original constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    4
    1 0 1 0
    0 0 0 1
    0 1 0 0
    1 0 0 1
    4
    1 0 1 0
    0 0 0 0
    1 0 1 1
    0 1 0 0

    -----Sample Output:-----
    SAFE
    UNSAFE

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.
