    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a grid of size \\( N \\times N \\) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\". An arrangement is considered \"SAFE\" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\" for each.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the size \\( N \\) and the \\( N \\times N \\) grid.\n\n2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). For each such cell, ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed. If any adjacent cell contains a bed, mark the grid as \"UNSAFE\".\n\n3. **Output**: For each test case, output \"SAFE\" if no unsafe conditions are found, otherwise output \"UNSAFE\".\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction is_safe(grid, N):\n    for each cell (i, j) in grid:\n        if grid[i][j] == 1:\n            for each direction (up, down, left, right, diagonals):\n                if adjacent cell in direction is within bounds and has a bed:\n                    return \"UNSAFE\"\n    return \"SAFE\"\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read N\n        read grid of size N x N\n        result = is_safe(grid, N)\n        print(result)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(grid, N):\n    # Directions: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]\n    \n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                for di, dj in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:\n                        return \"UNSAFE\"\n    return \"SAFE\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(N):\n            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            grid.append(row)\n        \n        result = is_safe(grid, N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the grid is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\", and outputs the result for each test case. The `is_safe` function checks each bed's surroundings to ensure no adjacent beds violate the safety condition.",
