        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem is to determine if a given list of matchstick lengths can be used to form a square. Each matchstick must be used exactly once, and you cannot break any matchstick. The goal is to see if you can arrange the matchsticks such that they form a square with equal side lengths.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Check Total Length**: First, calculate the total length of all matchsticks. If this total is not divisible by 4, it's impossible to form a square, so return `False`.\n\n2. **Determine Side Length**: If the total length is divisible by 4, then each side of the square must be equal to `total_length / 4`.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking approach to try and form the square. Start by sorting the matchsticks in descending order to optimize the process (larger sticks are harder to place, so try them first).\n\n4. **Recursive Function**: Create a recursive function that attempts to place each matchstick into one of the four sides. If a matchstick can fit into a side without exceeding the target side length, place it there and move to the next matchstick.\n\n5. **Base Case**: If all matchsticks are placed successfully, return `True`. If you cannot place a matchstick in any side without exceeding the target length, backtrack and try a different configuration.\n\n6. **Pruning**: If at any point a side becomes exactly equal to the target side length, move to the next side.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction makesquare(nums):\n    if nums is empty or sum(nums) % 4 != 0:\n        return False\n    \n    target_side_length = sum(nums) / 4\n    sort nums in descending order\n    \n    initialize sides as [0, 0, 0, 0]\n    \n    function canFormSquare(index):\n        if index == length of nums:\n            return all sides are equal to target_side_length\n        \n        for each side in sides:\n            if side + nums[index] <= target_side_length:\n                add nums[index] to side\n                if canFormSquare(index + 1):\n                    return True\n                remove nums[index] from side\n            if side is 0:\n                break\n        \n        return False\n    \n    return canFormSquare(0)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def makesquare(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        # If there are no matchsticks, we cannot form a square\n        if not nums:\n            return False\n        \n        # Calculate the total length of all matchsticks\n        total_length = sum(nums)\n        \n        # If the total length is not divisible by 4, we cannot form a square\n        if total_length % 4 != 0:\n            return False\n        \n        # Each side of the square must be of this length\n        target_side_length = total_length // 4\n        \n        # Sort the matchsticks in descending order\n        nums.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        # Initialize the four sides of the square\n        sides = [0] * 4\n        \n        # Helper function to attempt to form the square\n        def canFormSquare(index):\n            # If we've placed all matchsticks, check if all sides are equal to target\n            if index == len(nums):\n                return all(side == target_side_length for side in sides)\n            \n            # Try to place the current matchstick in each side\n            for i in range(4):\n                if sides[i] + nums[index] <= target_side_length:\n                    sides[i] += nums[index]\n                    if canFormSquare(index + 1):\n                        return True\n                    sides[i] -= nums[index]\n                \n                # If a side is 0, no need to try other sides as they are also 0\n                if sides[i] == 0:\n                    break\n            \n            return False\n        \n        # Start the recursive backtracking from the first matchstick\n        return canFormSquare(0)\n```\n\nThis solution uses a backtracking approach to try and fit each matchstick into one of the four sides of the square, ensuring that each side does not exceed the target side length.

The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.\n\n    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.\n\n    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            n = len(nums)\n            d = [1] * n\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are some key insights and differences:\n\n1. **Iterative Approach with Stack**: The official solution uses an iterative approach with a stack to simulate the backtracking process. This is an interesting alternative to the recursive backtracking I used. By using a stack, the solution avoids the potential pitfalls of recursion depth limits in Python.\n\n2. **State Representation**: The official solution represents the state using a tuple `(usedIndexSet, searchStartFromIndex, target, remainRounds)`. This is a compact way to track which matchsticks have been used, where to start the next search, the current target length for a side, and how many sides are left to complete. This state representation is efficient and helps in managing the search space effectively.\n\n3. **Early Pruning**: The solution includes early pruning by checking if the largest matchstick is greater than the target side length before proceeding. This is a simple yet effective optimization that can save unnecessary computations.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases, such as when the number of matchsticks is less than four, right at the beginning. This ensures that the function exits early when it's impossible to form a square.\n\n5. **Iterative Search**: By iterating from the largest to the smallest matchstick, the solution attempts to fit larger matchsticks first, which is generally more challenging and thus more efficient in pruning invalid paths early.\n\nOverall, the official solution is insightful in its use of an iterative approach with a stack, which can be more memory-efficient than recursion. The state representation and early pruning strategies are also valuable techniques that can be applied to similar combinatorial problems."
