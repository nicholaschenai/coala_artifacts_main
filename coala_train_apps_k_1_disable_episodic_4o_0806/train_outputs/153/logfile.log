## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Remember the story of Little Match Girl? By now, you know exactly what matchsticks the little match girl has, please find out a way you can make one square by using up all those matchsticks. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.

 Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their stick length. Your output will either be true or false, to represent whether you could make one square using all the matchsticks the little match girl has.

Example 1:

Input: [1,1,2,2,2]
Output: true

Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came two sticks with length 1.



Example 2:

Input: [3,3,3,3,4]
Output: false

Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks.



Note:

The length sum of the given matchsticks is in the range of 0 to 10^9.
The length of the given matchstick array will not exceed 15.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 153 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

The problem is to determine if a given list of matchstick lengths can be used to form a square. Each matchstick must be used exactly once, and you cannot break any matchstick. The goal is to see if you can arrange the matchsticks such that they form a square with equal side lengths.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Check Total Length**: First, calculate the total length of all matchsticks. If this total is not divisible by 4, it's impossible to form a square, so return `False`.

2. **Determine Side Length**: If the total length is divisible by 4, then each side of the square must be equal to `total_length / 4`.

3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking approach to try and form the square. Start by sorting the matchsticks in descending order to optimize the process (larger sticks are harder to place, so try them first).

4. **Recursive Function**: Create a recursive function that attempts to place each matchstick into one of the four sides. If a matchstick can fit into a side without exceeding the target side length, place it there and move to the next matchstick.

5. **Base Case**: If all matchsticks are placed successfully, return `True`. If you cannot place a matchstick in any side without exceeding the target length, backtrack and try a different configuration.

6. **Pruning**: If at any point a side becomes exactly equal to the target side length, move to the next side.

## Pseudocode

```
function makesquare(nums):
    if nums is empty or sum(nums) % 4 != 0:
        return False
    
    target_side_length = sum(nums) / 4
    sort nums in descending order
    
    initialize sides as [0, 0, 0, 0]
    
    function canFormSquare(index):
        if index == length of nums:
            return all sides are equal to target_side_length
        
        for each side in sides:
            if side + nums[index] <= target_side_length:
                add nums[index] to side
                if canFormSquare(index + 1):
                    return True
                remove nums[index] from side
            if side is 0:
                break
        
        return False
    
    return canFormSquare(0)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def makesquare(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        # If there are no matchsticks, we cannot form a square
        if not nums:
            return False
        
        # Calculate the total length of all matchsticks
        total_length = sum(nums)
        
        # If the total length is not divisible by 4, we cannot form a square
        if total_length % 4 != 0:
            return False
        
        # Each side of the square must be of this length
        target_side_length = total_length // 4
        
        # Sort the matchsticks in descending order
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Initialize the four sides of the square
        sides = [0] * 4
        
        # Helper function to attempt to form the square
        def canFormSquare(index):
            # If we've placed all matchsticks, check if all sides are equal to target
            if index == len(nums):
                return all(side == target_side_length for side in sides)
            
            # Try to place the current matchstick in each side
            for i in range(4):
                if sides[i] + nums[index] <= target_side_length:
                    sides[i] += nums[index]
                    if canFormSquare(index + 1):
                        return True
                    sides[i] -= nums[index]
                
                # If a side is 0, no need to try other sides as they are also 0
                if sides[i] == 0:
                    break
            
            return False
        
        # Start the recursive backtracking from the first matchstick
        return canFormSquare(0)
```

This solution uses a backtracking approach to try and fit each matchstick into one of the four sides of the square, ensuring that each side does not exceed the target side length. The matchsticks are sorted in descending order to optimize the placement process.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.

    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.

    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            if not nums:
                return 0
        
            n = len(nums)
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.

We need to determine if we can use all given matchsticks to form a square. Each matchstick can only be used once, and we cannot break any matchstick. The goal is to see if we can arrange the matchsticks such that they form a square with equal sides.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Check Total Length**: First, calculate the total length of all matchsticks. If this total is not divisible by 4, it's impossible to form a square, so we return `False`.

2. **Target Side Length**: If the total length is divisible by 4, the target length for each side of the square is `total_length / 4`.

3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking approach to try and form the square:
   - Sort the matchsticks in descending order to optimize the process (larger sticks are harder to place, so try them first).
   - Attempt to place each matchstick into one of the four sides.
   - Use a recursive function to try placing each matchstick and backtrack if a configuration doesn't work.

4. **Base Case**: If all matchsticks are placed successfully such that each side equals the target length, return `True`.

5. **Pruning**: If at any point a side exceeds the target length, backtrack immediately.

### Pseudocode

```
function makesquare(nums):
    if nums is empty, return False
    total_length = sum(nums)
    if total_length % 4 != 0, return False
    target_side_length = total_length / 4
    sort nums in descending order
    initialize sides as [0, 0, 0, 0]
    
    function backtrack(index):
        if index == length of nums:
            return all sides are equal to target_side_length
        for each side in sides:
            if side + nums[index] <= target_side_length:
                add nums[index] to side
                if backtrack(index + 1) is True, return True
                remove nums[index] from side
        return False
    
    return backtrack(0)
```

### Final Python Solution

INFO - [Task id] 153 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if we can use all given matchsticks to form a square. Each matchstick can only be used once, and we cannot break any matchstick. The goal is to see if we can arrange the matchsticks such that they form a square with equal sides.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Check Total Length**: First, calculate the total length of all matchsticks. If this total is not divisible by 4, it's impossible to form a square, so we return `False`.

2. **Target Side Length**: If the total length is divisible by 4, the target length for each side of the square is `total_length / 4`.

3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking approach to try and form the square:
   - Sort the matchsticks in descending order to optimize the process (larger sticks are harder to place, so try them first).
   - Attempt to place each matchstick into one of the four sides.
   - Use a recursive function to try placing each matchstick and backtrack if a configuration doesn't work.

4. **Base Case**: If all matchsticks are placed successfully such that each side equals the target length, return `True`.

5. **Pruning**: If at any point a side exceeds the target length, backtrack immediately.

### Pseudocode

```
function makesquare(nums):
    if nums is empty, return False
    total_length = sum(nums)
    if total_length % 4 != 0, return False
    target_side_length = total_length / 4
    sort nums in descending order
    initialize sides as [0, 0, 0, 0]
    
    function backtrack(index):
        if index == length of nums:
            return all sides are equal to target_side_length
        for each side in sides:
            if side + nums[index] <= target_side_length:
                add nums[index] to side
                if backtrack(index + 1) is True, return True
                remove nums[index] from side
        return False
    
    return backtrack(0)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def makesquare(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if not nums:
            return False
        
        total_length = sum(nums)
        if total_length % 4 != 0:
            return False
        
        target_side_length = total_length // 4
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        sides = [0] * 4
        
        def backtrack(index):
            if index == len(nums):
                return all(side == target_side_length for side in sides)
            
            for i in range(4):
                if sides[i] + nums[index] <= target_side_length:
                    sides[i] += nums[index]
                    if backtrack(index + 1):
                        return True
                    sides[i] -= nums[index]
            
            return False
        
        return backtrack(0)
```

This solution uses a backtracking approach to try and fit each matchstick into one of the four sides of the square, ensuring that each side reaches the target length. The matchsticks are sorted in descending order to optimize the placement process.

INFO - [Task id] 153 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine if a set of matchsticks could be arranged to form a square, using each matchstick exactly once. The core concept here is to use a backtracking approach to explore all possible ways to partition the matchsticks into four equal-length sides.

Key steps included:
1. **Checking Divisibility**: First, ensure the total length of all matchsticks is divisible by 4. If not, forming a square is impossible.
2. **Sorting for Optimization**: Sorting the matchsticks in descending order helps in placing larger matchsticks first, which can reduce the number of recursive calls needed.
3. **Backtracking**: Use a recursive function to attempt placing each matchstick into one of the four sides, backtracking if a configuration doesn't work. This involves trying to add the current matchstick to each side and checking if it fits within the target side length.
4. **Pruning**: If a side exceeds the target length, backtrack immediately to avoid unnecessary calculations.

The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered. The backtracking approach, combined with sorting, efficiently explored the possible configurations to determine if forming a square was feasible. This problem reinforced the utility of backtracking for partitioning problems and the importance of optimization techniques like sorting to improve performance.

INFO - [Task id] 153 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem of forming a square using matchsticks, the official solution provides a different approach compared to my initial backtracking method. Here are some key insights and differences:

1. **Iterative Approach with Stack**: The official solution uses an iterative approach with a stack to simulate the backtracking process. This is an interesting alternative to the recursive backtracking I used. By using a stack, the solution avoids the potential pitfalls of recursion depth limits in Python.

2. **State Representation**: The official solution represents the state using a tuple `(usedIndexSet, searchStartFromIndex, target, remainRounds)`. This is a compact way to track which matchsticks have been used, where to start the next search, the current target length for a side, and how many sides are left to complete. This state representation is efficient and helps in managing the search space effectively.

3. **Early Pruning**: The solution includes early pruning by checking if the largest matchstick is greater than the target side length before proceeding. This is a simple yet effective optimization that can save unnecessary computations.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases, such as when the number of matchsticks is less than four, right at the beginning. This ensures that the function exits early when it's impossible to form a square.

5. **Iterative Search**: By iterating from the largest to the smallest matchstick, the solution attempts to fit larger matchsticks first, which is generally more challenging and thus more efficient in pruning invalid paths early.

Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of an iterative approach with a stack, which can be more memory-efficient than recursion. The state representation and early pruning strategies are also valuable techniques that can be applied to similar combinatorial problems.

    "scenarios": "This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a set of items can be perfectly divided into equal parts, which is a common problem in combinatorics and optimization. Specifically, this problem is a variation of the partition problem, where the goal is to partition a set of numbers into subsets with equal sums. This can be applied in resource allocation, load balancing, and puzzle solving where constraints require exact partitioning. The solution involves backtracking, a common technique in solving constraint satisfaction problems, making it relevant for computer science students and professionals dealing with algorithm design and analysis.",

[description]
The function determines if a given list of integers can be partitioned into four subsets with equal sums, effectively checking if the integers can form a square with equal side lengths. It first checks if the list is empty or if the total sum of the integers is not divisible by fou...,
