The rows are formed by repeating the string `S` cyclically. We also have another string `T`. For each query, which provides a row number `N`, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: \n   - Each row `N` starts with the first character of `S` and continues by repeating `S` cyclically until it reaches `N` characters.\n   - For example, if `S = \"codechef\"`, the 12th row would be `\"codechefcode\"`.\n\n2. **Determine the Row Content**:\n   - For a given row `N`, the content is the first `N` characters of the infinite repetition of `S`.\n   - This can be achieved by taking the first `N % |S|` characters of `S` and then appending `N // |S|` full repetitions of `S`.\n\n3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:\n   - For each query, construct the row as described and count how many times `T` appears as a substring.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**:\n   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, use modular arithmetic to determine the necessary parts of `S` to construct the row.\n   - Use a sliding window or string search method to count occurrences of `T` efficiently.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    length_S = length of S\n    length_T = length of T\n    results = empty list\n\n    for each query N in queries:\n        full_repeats = N // length_S\n        partial_length = N % length_S\n        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]\n        \n        count = 0\n        for i from 0 to N - length_T:\n            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        append count to results\n\n    return results\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    length_S = len(S)\n    length_T = len(T)\n    results = []\n\n    for N in queries:\n        # Calculate how many full repetitions of S are needed\n        full_repeats = N // length_S\n        # Calculate the remaining part of S needed\n        partial_length = N % length_S\n        # Construct the row content\n        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]\n        \n        # Count occurrences of T in the row content\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(N - length_T + 1):\n            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        results.append(count)\n\n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# S = \"codechef\"\n# T = \"chefcode\"\n# queries = [4, 12, 1455]\n# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Line 1-2**: Define the function `count_occurrences` which takes the string `S`, the string `T`, and a list of queries.\n- **Line 3-4**: Calculate the lengths of `S` and `T`.\n- **Line 5**: Initialize an empty list `results` to store the results of each query.\n- **Line 7-8**: For each query `N`, calculate how many full repetitions of `S` fit into `N` and the remaining part needed.\n- **Line 9**: Construct the row content by repeating `S` and adding the necessary partial part.\n- **Line 12-14**: Use a loop to count how many times `T` appears in the constructed row content.\n- **Line 16**: Append the count to the results list.\n- **Line 18**: Return the list of results."

The key insight is to use a loop to repeatedly search for and remove the \"abc\" substring until it no longer exists in the string.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n\n    1. **Iterative Removal**: Both solutions use a loop to continuously remove \"abc\" from the string. This ensures that all occurrences are removed, even if new ones are formed after an initial removal.\n\n    2. **String Replacement**: The use of the `replace` method is crucial. It allows for the efficient removal of the first occurrence of \"abc\" in my solution, and all occurrences in the official solution. The difference is subtle but both achieve the same end result due to the loop.\n\n    3. **Efficiency Considerations**: The official solution uses `s.count(\"abc\")` to check for the presence of \"abc\", which might be slightly less efficient than checking directly with `\"abc\" in s` as in my solution. However, given the constraints, both approaches are acceptable.\n\n    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions are similar in approach and efficiency. The main takeaway is the effective use of string manipulation methods in Python to iteratively transform a string based on specific patterns.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This involves calculating combinations to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers and using powers of 2 to account for the remaining numbers.\n\n    2. **Efficiency in Computation**: My solution precomputes factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations using the formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).

The official solution, however, uses a more direct approach with loops to calculate combinations, which might be less efficient for larger inputs but is straightforward and avoids the need for precomputation.\n\n    3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly handle large numbers by using modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.\n\n    4. **Function Execution**: A key issue in my initial attempts was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output being produced.

The key challenge is handling very large row numbers (`N`) without explicitly constructing the entire row, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\n1. **Cyclic Construction**: The main strategy was to leverage the cyclic nature of the string `S` to construct rows without explicitly building them for large `N`. This involved using modular arithmetic to determine the position of characters in the row.\n\n2. **Precomputation**: Precomputing the number of times the substring `T` appears in a single cycle of `S` was a good strategy to handle full cycles efficiently.\n\n3. **Handling Overlaps**: A significant challenge was correctly handling overlaps of `T` at the boundaries between cycles. Initial attempts extended `S` to handle overlaps, but the logic for counting occurrences in the remainder part was flawed.\n\n4. **Counting Logic**: The counting logic needed to be adjusted to ensure all possible starting positions for `T` were considered, especially when `T` could span across the end of one cycle and the start of another.\n\n#### Errors and Fixes\n- **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop range for counting occurrences in the remainder part was initially incorrect, leading to missed occurrences. Adjusting the loop to correctly iterate over all potential starting positions fixed this issue.\n- **Output Handling**: Ensuring that results were printed correctly for each query was crucial, as the function needed to handle multiple queries efficiently.\n\nOverall, the problem highlighted the importance of understanding cyclic patterns and efficiently handling large inputs through precomputation and careful consideration of edge cases like overlaps."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Efficient Pattern Matching with KMP**:\n   - The official solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient substring search. This is a significant improvement over naive substring search methods, especially given the constraints of the problem where `N` can be very large.\n   - The KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern `T` to create an LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array, which helps in skipping unnecessary comparisons during the search.\n\n2. **Handling Large Rows with Cyclic Nature**:\n   - The solution effectively handles the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows by considering the string `S` repeated twice (`keyword * 2`). This ensures that any overlap of the pattern `T` at the boundary of cycles is captured.\n   - The solution calculates the number of full cycles and the remainder separately, which allows it to efficiently count occurrences of `T` in both parts.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Counting**:\n   - The solution uses a binary search (`search` function) to quickly count the number of valid starting positions for `T` within the constructed row. This is a clever use of binary search to handle the large potential search space efficiently.\n\n### Why My Approach Failed\n\n- **Inefficient Handling of Large `N`**: My approach attempted to construct the row directly and count occurrences, which is inefficient for large `N`. The official solution avoids this by leveraging the cyclic nature and using precomputed data.\n- **Overlooked Overlaps**: My solution did not adequately handle overlaps of `T` at the boundaries of cycles, which the official solution addresses by using `keyword * 2`.\n- **Lack of Advanced Search Techniques**: I did not employ advanced search techniques like KMP, which are crucial for efficiently solving problems with large input sizes and repeated patterns.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe official solution is insightful in its use of advanced algorithms and data structures to efficiently solve the problem. It highlights the importance of understanding and applying efficient algorithms like KMP for pattern matching and using binary search for counting in large datasets. This experience underscores the need to consider both the problem constraints and the potential for algorithmic optimizations in competitive programming."
