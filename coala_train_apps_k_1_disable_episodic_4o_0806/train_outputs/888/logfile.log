## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a string `S` and we use it to form a pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. The rows are formed by repeating the string `S` cyclically. We also have another string `T`. For each query, which provides a row number `N`, we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: 
   - Each row `N` starts with the first character of `S` and continues by repeating `S` cyclically until it reaches `N` characters.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Determine the Row Content**:
   - For a given row `N`, the content is the first `N` characters of the infinite repetition of `S`.
   - This can be achieved by taking the first `N % |S|` characters of `S` and then appending `N // |S|` full repetitions of `S`.

3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:
   - For each query, construct the row as described and count how many times `T` appears as a substring.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, use modular arithmetic to determine the necessary parts of `S` to construct the row.
   - Use a sliding window or string search method to count occurrences of `T` efficiently.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    length_S = length of S
    length_T = length of T
    results = empty list

    for each query N in queries:
        full_repeats = N // length_S
        partial_length = N % length_S
        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]
        
        count = 0
        for i from 0 to N - length_T:
            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        append count to results

    return results
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    length_S = len(S)
    length_T = len(T)
    results = []

    for N in queries:
        # Calculate how many full repetitions of S are needed
        full_repeats = N // length_S
        # Calculate the remaining part of S needed
        partial_length = N % length_S
        # Construct the row content
        row_content = S * full_repeats + S[:partial_length]
        
        # Count occurrences of T in the row content
        count = 0
        for i in range(N - length_T + 1):
            if row_content[i:i+length_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)

    return results

# Example usage:
# S = "codechef"
# T = "chefcode"
# queries = [4, 12, 1455]
# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Line 1-2**: Define the function `count_occurrences` which takes the string `S`, the string `T`, and a list of queries.
- **Line 3-4**: Calculate the lengths of `S` and `T`.
- **Line 5**: Initialize an empty list `results` to store the results of each query.
- **Line 7-8**: For each query `N`, calculate how many full repetitions of `S` fit into `N` and the remaining part needed.
- **Line 9**: Construct the row content by repeating `S` and adding the necessary partial part.
- **Line 12-14**: Use a loop to count how many times `T` appears in the constructed row content.
- **Line 16**: Append the count to the results list.
- **Line 18**: Return the list of results.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of removing consecutive "abc" substrings from a given string until none remain. The key insight is to use a loop to repeatedly search for and remove the "abc" substring until it no longer exists in the string.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Iterative Removal**: Both solutions use a loop to continuously remove "abc" from the string. This ensures that all occurrences are removed, even if new ones are formed after an initial removal.

    2. **String Replacement**: The use of the `replace` method is crucial. It allows for the efficient removal of the first occurrence of "abc" in my solution, and all occurrences in the official solution. The difference is subtle but both achieve the same end result due to the loop.

    3. **Efficiency Considerations**: The official solution uses `s.count("abc")` to check for the presence of "abc", which might be slightly less efficient than checking directly with `"abc" in s` as in my solution. However, given the constraints, both approaches are acceptable.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions are similar in approach and efficiency. The main takeaway is the effective use of string manipulation methods in Python to iteratively transform a string based on specific patterns.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a string `S` and we use it to form an infinite pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. Each row starts with the first character of `S` and continues in a cyclic manner. We also have a string `T` and a number of queries. Each query asks for the number of times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: 
   - Each row `N` is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Efficiently Handle Large `N`**:
   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the characters in the row.
   - The `i-th` character in the `N-th` row is `S[(i-1) % len(S)]`.

3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:
   - For each query, construct the `N-th` row using the above logic.
   - Count how many times `T` appears as a substring in this row.

4. **Optimize for Multiple Queries**:
   - Precompute the occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` to speed up counting in larger rows.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = length of S
    len_T = length of T
    precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    results = []
    for each query N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        count = full_cycles * occurrences of T in a single cycle
        construct the remainder part of the row
        count += occurrences of T in the remainder part
        append count to results
    return results
```

## Python Code

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)

# Example usage:
# S = "codechef"
# T = "chefcode"
# queries = [4, 12, 1455]
# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a string `S` and we use it to form an infinite pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. Each row starts with the first character of `S` and continues in a cyclic manner. We also have a string `T` and a number of queries. Each query asks for the number of times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: 
   - Each row `N` is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Efficiently Handle Large `N`**:
   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the characters in the row.
   - The `i-th` character in the `N-th` row is `S[(i-1) % len(S)]`.

3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:
   - For each query, construct the `N-th` row using the above logic.
   - Count how many times `T` appears as a substring in this row.

4. **Optimize for Multiple Queries**:
   - Precompute the occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` to speed up counting in larger rows.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = length of S
    len_T = length of T
    precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    results = []
    for each query N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        count = full_cycles * occurrences of T in a single cycle
        construct the remainder part of the row
        count += occurrences of T in the remainder part
        append count to results
    return results
```

## Python Code

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# S = "codechef"
# T = "chefcode"
# queries = [4, 12, 1455]
# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))
```

This code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows and precomputing occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S`. It then uses this precomputed information to quickly answer each query.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: 
   - The code provided is structured as a function, but it doesn't include the necessary input/output handling to read from standard input and write to standard output. This is likely why no output is detected.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `count_occurrences` is defined but not called in the context of reading from standard input and writing to standard output.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function returns a list of results, but these results need to be printed line by line as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be correct, but it needs to be verified with actual input/output operations.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Implement the input reading and output writing directly in the script.
- Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
- Print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement.

Let's revise the solution to include these corrections:

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S

    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

S = data[0]
T = data[1]
Q = int(data[2])
queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]

# Get results
results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. We then parse `S`, `T`, and the list of queries.
- **Function Call**: We call `count_occurrences` with the parsed inputs.
- **Output**: We print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement. 

This should address the issues and ensure the solution works correctly with the provided input/output format.

Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Combinatorial Counting**: Both my solution and the official solution rely on combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position. This involves calculating combinations to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers and using powers of 2 to account for the remaining numbers.

    2. **Efficiency in Computation**: My solution precomputes factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations using the formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \). This approach is efficient for large values of `N` and `K`, as it avoids recalculating factorials for each query. The official solution, however, uses a more direct approach with loops to calculate combinations, which might be less efficient for larger inputs but is straightforward and avoids the need for precomputation.

    3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly handle large numbers by using modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.

    4. **Function Execution**: A key issue in my initial attempts was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output being produced. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed, especially when using functions to encapsulate the solution.

    5. **Input/Output Handling**: The official solution uses `input()` and `print()` for handling input and output, which is straightforward and works well for competitive programming environments. My solution used `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write`, which are efficient for handling large input and output but require careful management of data parsing and function execution.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations, careful handling of input/output, and ensuring that the main logic is executed. The official solution provides a simpler, albeit potentially less efficient, approach to the problem, which can be useful in scenarios where precomputation is not feasible or necessary.

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and split it into a list of strings. We then parse `S`, `T`, and the list of queries.
- **Function Call**: We call `count_occurrences` with the parsed inputs.
- **Output**: We print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement.

This code should now correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem, and efficiently compute the number of occurrences of `T` in each queried row of the pyramid.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
codechef
chefcode
3
4
12
1455

-----Sample Output:-----
0
1
181

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a string `S` and we use it to form an infinite pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. Each row starts with the first character of `S` and continues in a cyclic manner. We also have a string `T` and a number of queries. Each query asks for the number of times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: 
   - Each row `N` is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Efficiently Handle Large `N`**:
   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the characters in the row.
   - The `i-th` character in the `N-th` row is `S[(i-1) % len(S)]`.

3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:
   - For each query, construct the `N-th` row using the above logic.
   - Count how many times `T` appears as a substring in this row.

4. **Optimize for Multiple Queries**:
   - Precompute the occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` to speed up counting in larger rows.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = length of S
    len_T = length of T
    precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    results = []
    for each query N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        count = full_cycles * occurrences of T in a single cycle
        construct the remainder part of the row
        count += occurrences of T in the remainder part
        append count to results
    return results
```

## Python Code

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# S = "codechef"
# T = "chefcode"
# queries = [4, 12, 1455]
# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))
```

This code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows and precomputing occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S`. It then uses this precomputed information to quickly answer each query.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: 
   - The code provided is structured as a function, but it doesn't include the necessary input/output handling to read from standard input and write to standard output. This is likely why no output is detected.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `count_occurrences` is defined but not called in the context of reading from standard input and writing to standard output.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function returns a list of results, but these results need to be printed line by line as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be correct, but it needs to be verified with actual input/output operations.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Implement the input reading and output writing directly in the script.
- Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
- Print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement.

Let's revise the solution to include these corrections:

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S

    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles

        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

data = input().split()

S = data[0]
T = data[1]
Q = int(data[2])
queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]

# Get results
results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. We then parse `S`, `T`, and the list of queries.
- **Function Call**: We call `count_occurrences` with the parsed inputs.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Logic for Counting Occurrences**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be incorrect. Specifically, the way we handle the wrap-around using `(S * 2)[:remainder]` might not be correctly capturing the cyclic nature of the string for large `N`.

2. **Handling Large Rows**:
   - For very large `N`, the row is constructed by repeating `S` many times. The current approach might not be correctly handling the overlap between the end of one cycle and the start of the next.

3. **Precomputation of Cycles**:
   - The precomputation of occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` is correct, but the application of this precomputation to the full row might be flawed.

4. **Remainder Handling**:
   - The remainder part of the row should be carefully constructed to ensure that any potential overlap of `T` at the boundary between cycles is considered.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Correctly handle the cyclic nature of the string when constructing the row.
- Ensure that the counting logic correctly accounts for overlaps at the boundaries of cycles.

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        # We need to consider the overlap between the end of the last full cycle and the remainder
        extended_part = S + S[:len_T-1]  # Extend S to handle overlap
        remainder_part = extended_part[:remainder + len_T - 1]
        
        for i in range(remainder):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Read input

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

S = data[0]
T = data[1]
Q = int(data[2])
queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]

# Get results
results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Extended Part**: We extend `S` by `S[:len_T-1]` to handle potential overlaps at the boundary between cycles.
- **Remainder Part**: We construct the `remainder_part` by taking the first `remainder + len_T - 1` characters of the `extended_part` to ensure we capture any overlap.
- **Counting Logic**: We iterate over the `remainder_part` to count occurrences of `T`, ensuring we consider overlaps.

This should address the issues and ensure the solution works correctly with the provided input/output format.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a string `S` and we use it to form an infinite pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. Each row starts with the first character of `S` and continues in a cyclic manner. We also have a string `T` and a number of queries. Each query asks for the number of times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: 
   - Each row `N` is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Efficiently Handle Large `N`**:
   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the characters in the row.
   - The `i-th` character in the `N-th` row is `S[(i-1) % len(S)]`.

3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:
   - For each query, construct the `N-th` row using the above logic.
   - Count how many times `T` appears as a substring in this row.

4. **Optimize for Multiple Queries**:
   - Precompute the occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` to speed up counting in larger rows.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = length of S
    len_T = length of T
    precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    results = []
    for each query N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        count = full_cycles * occurrences of T in a single cycle
        construct the remainder part of the row
        count += occurrences of T in the remainder part
        append count to results
    return results
```

## Python Code

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# S = "codechef"
# T = "chefcode"
# queries = [4, 12, 1455]
# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))
```

This code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows and precomputing occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S`. It then uses this precomputed information to quickly answer each query.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: 
   - The code provided is structured as a function, but it doesn't include the necessary input/output handling to read from standard input and write to standard output. This is likely why no output is detected.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `count_occurrences` is defined but not called in the context of reading from standard input and writing to standard output.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function returns a list of results, but these results need to be printed line by line as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be correct, but it needs to be verified with actual input/output operations.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Implement the input reading and output writing directly in the script.
- Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
- Print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement.

Let's revise the solution to include these corrections:

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

S = data[0]
T = data[1]
Q = int(data[2])
queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]

# Get results
results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. We then parse `S`, `T`, and the list of queries.
- **Function Call**: We call `count_occurrences` with the parsed inputs.
- **Output**: We print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement. 

This should address the issues and ensure the solution works correctly with the provided input/output format.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Logic for Counting Occurrences**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be incorrect. Specifically, the way we handle the wrap-around using `(S * 2)[:remainder]` might not be correctly capturing the cyclic nature of the string for large `N`.

2. **Handling Large Rows**:
   - For very large `N`, the row is constructed by repeating `S` many times. The current approach might not be correctly handling the overlap between the end of one cycle and the start of the next.

3. **Precomputation of Cycles**:
   - The precomputation of occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` is correct, but the application of this precomputation to the full row might be flawed.

4. **Remainder Handling**:
   - The remainder part of the row should be carefully constructed to ensure that any potential overlap of `T` at the boundary between cycles is considered.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Correctly handle the cyclic nature of the string when constructing the row.
- Ensure that the counting logic correctly accounts for overlaps at the boundaries of cycles.

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        # We need to consider the overlap between the end of the last full cycle and the remainder
        extended_part = S + S[:len_T-1]  # Extend S to handle overlap
        remainder_part = extended_part[:remainder + len_T - 1]
        
        for i in range(remainder):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:

# Get results
results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Extended Part**: We extend `S` by `S[:len_T-1]` to handle potential overlaps at the boundary between cycles.
- **Remainder Part**: We construct the `remainder_part` by taking the first `remainder + len_T - 1` characters of the `extended_part` to ensure we capture any overlap.
- **Counting Logic**: We iterate over the `remainder_part` to count occurrences of `T`, ensuring we consider overlaps.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Combinatorial Counting**: Both my solution and the official solution rely on combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position. This involves calculating combinations to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers and using powers of 2 to account for the remaining numbers.

    2. **Efficiency in Computation**: My solution precomputes factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations using the formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \). This approach is efficient for large values of `N` and `K`, as it avoids recalculating factorials for each query. The official solution, however, uses a more direct approach with loops to calculate combinations, which might be less efficient for larger inputs but is straightforward and avoids the need for precomputation.

    3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly handle large numbers by using modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.

    4. **Function Execution**: A key issue in my initial attempts was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output being produced. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed, especially when using functions to encapsulate the solution.

    5. **Input/Output Handling**: The official solution uses `input()` and `print()` for handling input and output, which is straightforward and works well for competitive programming environments. My solution used `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write`, which are efficient for handling large input and output but require careful management of data parsing and function execution.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations, careful handling of input/output, and ensuring that the main logic is executed. The official solution provides a simpler, albeit potentially less efficient, approach to the problem, which can be useful in scenarios where precomputation is not feasible or necessary.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
codechef
chefcode
3
4
12
1455

-----Sample Output:-----
0
1
181

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a string `S` and we use it to form an infinite pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. Each row starts with the first character of `S` and continues in a cyclic manner. We also have a string `T` and a number of queries. Each query asks for the number of times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: 
   - Each row `N` is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Efficiently Handle Large `N`**:
   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the characters in the row.
   - The `i-th` character in the `N-th` row is `S[(i-1) % len(S)]`.

3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:
   - For each query, construct the `N-th` row using the above logic.
   - Count how many times `T` appears as a substring in this row.

4. **Optimize for Multiple Queries**:
   - Precompute the occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` to speed up counting in larger rows.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = length of S
    len_T = length of T
    precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    results = []
    for each query N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        count = full_cycles * occurrences of T in a single cycle
        construct the remainder part of the row
        count += occurrences of T in the remainder part
        append count to results
    return results
```

## Python Code

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# S = "codechef"
# T = "chefcode"
# queries = [4, 12, 1455]
# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))
```

This code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows and precomputing occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S`. It then uses this precomputed information to quickly answer each query.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: 
   - The code provided is structured as a function, but it doesn't include the necessary input/output handling to read from standard input and write to standard output. This is likely why no output is detected.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `count_occurrences` is defined but not called in the context of reading from standard input and writing to standard output.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function returns a list of results, but these results need to be printed line by line as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be correct, but it needs to be verified with actual input/output operations.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Implement the input reading and output writing directly in the script.
- Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
- Print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement.

Let's revise the solution to include these corrections:

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

S = data[0]
T = data[1]
Q = int(data[2])
queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]

# Get results
results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. We then parse `S`, `T`, and the list of queries.
- **Function Call**: We call `count_occurrences` with the parsed inputs.
- **Output**: We print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement. 

This should address the issues and ensure the solution works correctly with the provided input/output format.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Logic for Counting Occurrences**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be incorrect. Specifically, the way we handle the wrap-around using `(S * 2)[:remainder]` might not be correctly capturing the cyclic nature of the string for large `N`.

2. **Handling Large Rows**:
   - For very large `N`, the row is constructed by repeating `S` many times. The current approach might not be correctly handling the overlap between the end of one cycle and the start of the next.

3. **Precomputation of Cycles**:
   - The precomputation of occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` is correct, but the application of this precomputation to the full row might be flawed.

4. **Remainder Handling**:
   - The remainder part of the row should be carefully constructed to ensure that any potential overlap of `T` at the boundary between cycles is considered.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Correctly handle the cyclic nature of the string when constructing the row.
- Ensure that the counting logic correctly accounts for overlaps at the boundaries of cycles.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Extended Part**: We extend `S` by `S[:len_T-1]` to handle potential overlaps at the boundary between cycles.
- **Remainder Part**: We construct the `remainder_part` by taking the first `remainder + len_T - 1` characters of the `extended_part` to ensure we capture any overlap.

1. **Handling of Remainder Part**:
   - The logic for handling the remainder part of the row might not be correctly capturing all possible occurrences of `T`, especially when `T` can overlap between the end of one cycle and the start of the next.

2. **Overlap Consideration**:
   - The current approach extends `S` by `S[:len_T-1]` to handle overlaps, but it seems this is not sufficient for all cases, especially when `N` is large and `T` can span across multiple cycles.

3. **Counting Logic**:
   - The counting logic for the remainder part might not be correctly iterating over all possible starting positions for `T` in the constructed row.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
codechef
chefcode
3
4
12
1455

-----Sample Output:-----
0
1
181

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a string `S` and we use it to form an infinite pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. Each row starts with the first character of `S` and continues in a cyclic manner. We also have a string `T` and a number of queries. Each query asks for the number of times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: 
   - Each row `N` is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Efficiently Handle Large `N`**:
   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the characters in the row.
   - The `i-th` character in the `N-th` row is `S[(i-1) % len(S)]`.

3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:
   - For each query, construct the `N-th` row using the above logic.
   - Count how many times `T` appears as a substring in this row.

4. **Optimize for Multiple Queries**:
   - Precompute the occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` to speed up counting in larger rows.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = length of S
    len_T = length of T
    precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    results = []
    for each query N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        count = full_cycles * occurrences of T in a single cycle
        construct the remainder part of the row
        count += occurrences of T in the remainder part
        append count to results
    return results
```

## Python Code

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# S = "codechef"
# T = "chefcode"
# queries = [4, 12, 1455]
# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))
```

This code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows and precomputing occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S`. It then uses this precomputed information to quickly answer each query.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: 
   - The code provided is structured as a function, but it doesn't include the necessary input/output handling to read from standard input and write to standard output. This is likely why no output is detected.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `count_occurrences` is defined but not called in the context of reading from standard input and writing to standard output.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function returns a list of results, but these results need to be printed line by line as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be correct, but it needs to be verified with actual input/output operations.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Implement the input reading and output writing directly in the script.
- Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
- Print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement.

Let's revise the solution to include these corrections:

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

S = data[0]
T = data[1]
Q = int(data[2])
queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]

# Get results
results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. We then parse `S`, `T`, and the list of queries.
- **Function Call**: We call `count_occurrences` with the parsed inputs.
- **Output**: We print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Logic for Counting Occurrences**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be incorrect. Specifically, the way we handle the wrap-around using `(S * 2)[:remainder]` might not be correctly capturing the cyclic nature of the string for large `N`.

2. **Handling Large Rows**:
   - For very large `N`, the row is constructed by repeating `S` many times. The current approach might not be correctly handling the overlap between the end of one cycle and the start of the next.

3. **Precomputation of Cycles**:
   - The precomputation of occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` is correct, but the application of this precomputation to the full row might be flawed.

4. **Remainder Handling**:
   - The remainder part of the row should be carefully constructed to ensure that any potential overlap of `T` at the boundary between cycles is considered.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Correctly handle the cyclic nature of the string when constructing the row.
- Ensure that the counting logic correctly accounts for overlaps at the boundaries of cycles.

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Extended Part**: We extend `S` by `S[:len_T-1]` to handle potential overlaps at the boundary between cycles.
- **Remainder Part**: We construct the `remainder_part` by taking the first `remainder + len_T - 1` characters of the `extended_part` to ensure we capture any overlap.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Combinatorial Counting**: Both my solution and the official solution rely on combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position. This involves calculating combinations to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers and using powers of 2 to account for the remaining numbers.

    2. **Efficiency in Computation**: My solution precomputes factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations using the formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \). This approach is efficient for large values of `N` and `K`, as it avoids recalculating factorials for each query. The official solution, however, uses a more direct approach with loops to calculate combinations, which might be less efficient for larger inputs but is straightforward and avoids the need for precomputation.

    3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly handle large numbers by using modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.

    4. **Function Execution**: A key issue in my initial attempts was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output being produced. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed, especially when using functions to encapsulate the solution.

    5. **Input/Output Handling**: The official solution uses `input()` and `print()` for handling input and output, which is straightforward and works well for competitive programming environments. My solution used `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write`, which are efficient for handling large input and output but require careful management of data parsing and function execution.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations, careful handling of input/output, and ensuring that the main logic is executed. The official solution provides a simpler, albeit potentially less efficient, approach to the problem, which can be useful in scenarios where precomputation is not feasible or necessary.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Extended Part**: We extend `S` by `S[:len_T-1]` to handle potential overlaps at the boundary between cycles.
- **Remainder Part**: We construct the `remainder_part` by taking the first `remainder + len_T - 1` characters of the `extended_part` to ensure we capture any overlap.
- **Counting Logic**: We iterate over the `remainder_part` to count occurrences of `T`, ensuring we consider overlaps by adjusting the loop range to `remainder + len_T - 1 - len_T + 1`.

This should address the issues and ensure the solution works correctly with the provided input/output format.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
codechef
chefcode
3
4
12
1455

-----Sample Output:-----
0
1
181

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a string `S` and we use it to form an infinite pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. Each row starts with the first character of `S` and continues in a cyclic manner. We also have a string `T` and a number of queries. Each query asks for the number of times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: 
   - Each row `N` is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Efficiently Handle Large `N`**:
   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the characters in the row.
   - The `i-th` character in the `N-th` row is `S[(i-1) % len(S)]`.

3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:
   - For each query, construct the `N-th` row using the above logic.
   - Count how many times `T` appears as a substring in this row.

4. **Optimize for Multiple Queries**:
   - Precompute the occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` to speed up counting in larger rows.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = length of S
    len_T = length of T
    precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    results = []
    for each query N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        count = full_cycles * occurrences of T in a single cycle
        construct the remainder part of the row
        count += occurrences of T in the remainder part
        append count to results
    return results
```

## Python Code

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# S = "codechef"
# T = "chefcode"
# queries = [4, 12, 1455]
# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))
```

This code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows and precomputing occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S`. It then uses this precomputed information to quickly answer each query.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: 
   - The code provided is structured as a function, but it doesn't include the necessary input/output handling to read from standard input and write to standard output. This is likely why no output is detected.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `count_occurrences` is defined but not called in the context of reading from standard input and writing to standard output.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function returns a list of results, but these results need to be printed line by line as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be correct, but it needs to be verified with actual input/output operations.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Implement the input reading and output writing directly in the script.
- Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
- Print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement.

Let's revise the solution to include these corrections:

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S

    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Get results
results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. We then parse `S`, `T`, and the list of queries.
- **Function Call**: We call `count_occurrences` with the parsed inputs.
- **Output**: We print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Logic for Counting Occurrences**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be incorrect. Specifically, the way we handle the wrap-around using `(S * 2)[:remainder]` might not be correctly capturing the cyclic nature of the string for large `N`.

2. **Handling Large Rows**:
   - For very large `N`, the row is constructed by repeating `S` many times. The current approach might not be correctly handling the overlap between the end of one cycle and the start of the next.

3. **Precomputation of Cycles**:
   - The precomputation of occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` is correct, but the application of this precomputation to the full row might be flawed.

4. **Remainder Handling**:
   - The remainder part of the row should be carefully constructed to ensure that any potential overlap of `T` at the boundary between cycles is considered.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Correctly handle the cyclic nature of the string when constructing the row.
- Ensure that the counting logic correctly accounts for overlaps at the boundaries of cycles.

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):

            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        # We need to consider the overlap between the end of the last full cycle and the remainder
        extended_part = S + S[:len_T-1]  # Extend S to handle overlap
        remainder_part = extended_part[:remainder + len_T - 1]
        
        for i in range(remainder):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:

# Get results
results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Extended Part**: We extend `S` by `S[:len_T-1]` to handle potential overlaps at the boundary between cycles.
- **Remainder Part**: We construct the `remainder_part` by taking the first `remainder + len_T - 1` characters of the `extended_part` to ensure we capture any overlap.
- **Counting Logic**: We iterate over the `remainder_part` to count occurrences of `T`, ensuring we consider overlaps.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Extended Part**: We extend `S` by `S[:len_T-1]` to handle potential overlaps at the boundary between cycles.
- **Remainder Part**: We construct the `remainder_part` by taking the first `remainder + len_T - 1` characters of the `extended_part` to ensure we capture any overlap.
- **Counting Logic**: We iterate over the `remainder_part` to count occurrences of `T`, ensuring we consider overlaps.

This should address the issues and ensure the solution works correctly with the provided input/output format.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Handling of Remainder Part**:
   - The logic for handling the remainder part of the row might not be correctly capturing all possible occurrences of `T`, especially when `T` can overlap between the end of one cycle and the start of the next.

2. **Overlap Consideration**:
   - The current approach extends `S` by `S[:len_T-1]` to handle overlaps, but it seems this is not sufficient for all cases, especially when `N` is large and `T` can span across multiple cycles.

3. **Counting Logic**:
   - The counting logic for the remainder part might not be correctly iterating over all possible starting positions for `T` in the constructed row.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Ensure that the remainder part is constructed in a way that fully captures all possible overlaps.
- Adjust the counting logic to correctly iterate over all possible starting positions for `T`.

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts on the Pyramid String Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem revolves around constructing a pyramid of strings using a cyclic pattern and efficiently counting occurrences of a substring within these constructed rows. The key challenge is handling very large row numbers (`N`) without explicitly constructing the entire row, which would be computationally expensive.

#### Strategies and Challenges
1. **Cyclic Construction**: The main strategy was to leverage the cyclic nature of the string `S` to construct rows without explicitly building them for large `N`. This involved using modular arithmetic to determine the position of characters in the row.

2. **Precomputation**: Precomputing the number of times the substring `T` appears in a single cycle of `S` was a good strategy to handle full cycles efficiently.

3. **Handling Overlaps**: A significant challenge was correctly handling overlaps of `T` at the boundaries between cycles. Initial attempts extended `S` to handle overlaps, but the logic for counting occurrences in the remainder part was flawed.

4. **Counting Logic**: The counting logic needed to be adjusted to ensure all possible starting positions for `T` were considered, especially when `T` could span across the end of one cycle and the start of another.

#### Errors and Fixes
- **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop range for counting occurrences in the remainder part was initially incorrect, leading to missed occurrences. Adjusting the loop to correctly iterate over all potential starting positions fixed this issue.
- **Output Handling**: Ensuring that results were printed correctly for each query was crucial, as the function needed to handle multiple queries efficiently.

Overall, the problem highlighted the importance of understanding cyclic patterns and efficiently handling large inputs through precomputation and careful consideration of edge cases like overlaps.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
codechef
chefcode
3
4
12
1455

-----Sample Output:-----
0
1
181

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a string `S` and we use it to form an infinite pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. Each row starts with the first character of `S` and continues in a cyclic manner. We also have a string `T` and a number of queries. Each query asks for the number of times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: 
   - Each row `N` is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.
   - For example, if `S = "codechef"`, the 12th row would be `"codechefcode"`.

2. **Efficiently Handle Large `N`**:
   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the characters in the row.
   - The `i-th` character in the `N-th` row is `S[(i-1) % len(S)]`.

3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:
   - For each query, construct the `N-th` row using the above logic.
   - Count how many times `T` appears as a substring in this row.

4. **Optimize for Multiple Queries**:
   - Precompute the occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` to speed up counting in larger rows.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = length of S
    len_T = length of T
    precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    results = []
    for each query N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        count = full_cycles * occurrences of T in a single cycle
        construct the remainder part of the row
        count += occurrences of T in the remainder part
        append count to results
    return results
```

## Python Code

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around
        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# S = "codechef"
# T = "chefcode"
# queries = [4, 12, 1455]
# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))
```

This code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows and precomputing occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S`. It then uses this precomputed information to quickly answer each query.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Input/Output Handling**: 
   - The code provided is structured as a function, but it doesn't include the necessary input/output handling to read from standard input and write to standard output. This is likely why no output is detected.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `count_occurrences` is defined but not called in the context of reading from standard input and writing to standard output.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function returns a list of results, but these results need to be printed line by line as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be correct, but it needs to be verified with actual input/output operations.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Implement the input reading and output writing directly in the script.
- Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
- Print each result on a new line as required by the problem statement.

            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Get results
results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. We then parse `S`, `T`, and the list of queries.
- **Function Call**: We call `count_occurrences` with the parsed inputs.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Logic for Counting Occurrences**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of `T` in the remainder part of the row might be incorrect. Specifically, the way we handle the wrap-around using `(S * 2)[:remainder]` might not be correctly capturing the cyclic nature of the string for large `N`.

2. **Handling Large Rows**:
   - For very large `N`, the row is constructed by repeating `S` many times. The current approach might not be correctly handling the overlap between the end of one cycle and the start of the next.

3. **Precomputation of Cycles**:
   - The precomputation of occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` is correct, but the application of this precomputation to the full row might be flawed.

4. **Remainder Handling**:
   - The remainder part of the row should be carefully constructed to ensure that any potential overlap of `T` at the boundary between cycles is considered.

- **Remainder Part**: We construct the `remainder_part` by taking the first `remainder + len_T - 1` characters of the `extended_part` to ensure we capture any overlap.
- **Counting Logic**: We iterate over the `remainder_part` to count occurrences of `T`, ensuring we consider overlaps.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Handling of Remainder Part**:
   - The logic for handling the remainder part of the row might not be correctly capturing all possible occurrences of `T`, especially when `T` can overlap between the end of one cycle and the start of the next.

2. **Overlap Consideration**:
   - The current approach extends `S` by `S[:len_T-1]` to handle overlaps, but it seems this is not sufficient for all cases, especially when `N` is large and `T` can span across multiple cycles.

3. **Counting Logic**:
   - The counting logic for the remainder part might not be correctly iterating over all possible starting positions for `T` in the constructed row.

To address these issues, we need to:
- Ensure that the remainder part is constructed in a way that fully captures all possible overlaps.
- Adjust the counting logic to correctly iterate over all possible starting positions for `T`.

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python
def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
    len_S = len(S)
    len_T = len(T)
    
    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S
    cycle_count = 0
    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):
        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:
            cycle_count += 1
    
    results = []
    for N in queries:
        full_cycles = N // len_S
        remainder = N % len_S
        
        # Count occurrences in full cycles
        count = full_cycles * cycle_count
        
        # Construct the remainder part of the row
        # We need to consider the overlap between the end of the last full cycle and the remainder
        extended_part = S + S[:len_T-1]  # Extend S to handle overlap
        remainder_part = extended_part[:remainder + len_T - 1]
        
        for i in range(remainder + len_T - 1 - len_T + 1):
            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:

### Key Insights from the Official Solution

1. **Efficient Pattern Matching with KMP**:
   - The official solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient substring search. This is a significant improvement over naive substring search methods, especially given the constraints of the problem where `N` can be very large.
   - The KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern `T` to create an LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array, which helps in skipping unnecessary comparisons during the search.

2. **Handling Large Rows with Cyclic Nature**:
   - The solution effectively handles the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows by considering the string `S` repeated twice (`keyword * 2`). This ensures that any overlap of the pattern `T` at the boundary of cycles is captured.
   - The solution calculates the number of full cycles and the remainder separately, which allows it to efficiently count occurrences of `T` in both parts.

3. **Binary Search for Efficient Counting**:
   - The solution uses a binary search (`search` function) to quickly count the number of valid starting positions for `T` within the constructed row. This is a clever use of binary search to handle the large potential search space efficiently.

### Why My Approach Failed

- **Inefficient Handling of Large `N`**: My approach attempted to construct the row directly and count occurrences, which is inefficient for large `N`. The official solution avoids this by leveraging the cyclic nature and using precomputed data.
- **Overlooked Overlaps**: My solution did not adequately handle overlaps of `T` at the boundaries of cycles, which the official solution addresses by using `keyword * 2`.
- **Lack of Advanced Search Techniques**: I did not employ advanced search techniques like KMP, which are crucial for efficiently solving problems with large input sizes and repeated patterns.

### Conclusion

The official solution is insightful in its use of advanced algorithms and data structures to efficiently solve the problem. It highlights the importance of understanding and applying efficient algorithms like KMP for pattern matching and using binary search for counting in large datasets. This experience underscores the need to consider both the problem constraints and the potential for algorithmic optimizations in competitive programming.
