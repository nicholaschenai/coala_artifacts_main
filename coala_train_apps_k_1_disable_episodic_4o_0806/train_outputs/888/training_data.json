    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts on the Pyramid String Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem revolves around constructing a pyramid of strings using a cyclic pattern and efficiently counting occurrences of a substring within these constructed rows. The key challenge is handling very large row numbers (`N`) without explicitly constructing the entire row, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\n1. **Cyclic Construction**: The main strategy was to leverage the cyclic nature of the string `S` to construct rows without explicitly building them for large `N`. This involved using modular arithmetic to determine the position of characters in the row.\n\n2. **Precomputation**: Precomputing the number of times the substring `T` appears in a single cycle of `S` was a good strategy to handle full cycles efficiently.\n\n3. **Handling Overlaps**: A significant challenge was correctly handling overlaps of `T` at the boundaries between cycles. Initial attempts extended `S` to handle overlaps, but the logic for counting occurrences in the remainder part was flawed.\n\n4. **Counting Logic**: The counting logic needed to be adjusted to ensure all possible starting positions for `T` were considered, especially when `T` could span across the end of one cycle and the start of another.\n\n#### Errors and Fixes\n- **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop range for counting occurrences in the remainder part was initially incorrect, leading to missed occurrences. Adjusting the loop to correctly iterate over all potential starting positions fixed this issue.\n- **Output Handling**: Ensuring that results were printed correctly for each query was crucial, as the function needed to handle multiple queries efficiently.\n\nOverall, the problem highlighted the importance of understanding cyclic patterns and efficiently handling large inputs through precomputation and careful consideration of edge cases like overlaps.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Efficient Pattern Matching with KMP**:\n   - The official solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient substring search. This is a significant improvement over naive substring search methods, especially given the constraints of the problem where `N` can be very large.\n   - The KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern `T` to create an LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array, which helps in skipping unnecessary comparisons during the search.\n\n2. **Handling Large Rows with Cyclic Nature**:\n   - The solution effectively handles the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows by considering the string `S` repeated twice (`keyword * 2`). This ensures that any overlap of the pattern `T` at the boundary of cycles is captured.\n   - The solution calculates the number of full cycles and the remainder separately, which allows it to efficiently count occurrences of `T` in both parts.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Counting**:\n   - The solution uses a binary search (`search` function) to quickly count the number of valid starting positions for `T` within the constructed row. This is a clever use of binary search to handle the large potential search space efficiently.\n\n### Why My Approach Failed\n\n- **Inefficient Handling of Large `N`**: My approach attempted to construct the row directly and count occurrences, which is inefficient for large `N`. The official solution avoids this by leveraging the cyclic nature and using precomputed data.\n- **Overlooked Overlaps**: My solution did not adequately handle overlaps of `T` at the boundaries of cycles, which the official solution addresses by using `keyword * 2`.\n- **Lack of Advanced Search Techniques**: I did not employ advanced search techniques like KMP, which are crucial for efficiently solving problems with large input sizes and repeated patterns.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe official solution is insightful in its use of advanced algorithms and data structures to efficiently solve the problem. It highlights the importance of understanding and applying efficient algorithms like KMP for pattern matching and using binary search for counting in large datasets. This experience underscores the need to consider both the problem constraints and the potential for algorithmic optimizations in competitive programming.",
