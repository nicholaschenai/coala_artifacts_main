    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe have a string `S` and we use it to form an infinite pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. Each row starts with the first character of `S` and continues in a cyclic manner. We also have a string `T` and a number of queries. Each query asks for the number of times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Pyramid Construction**: \n   - Each row `N` is constructed by repeating the string `S` cyclically until it reaches a length of `N`.\n   - For example, if `S = \"codechef\"`, the 12th row would be `\"codechefcode\"`.\n\n2. **Efficiently Handle Large `N`**:\n   - Directly constructing the row for very large `N` is inefficient. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the characters in the row.\n   - The `i-th` character in the `N-th` row is `S[(i-1) % len(S)]`.\n\n3. **Count Occurrences of `T`**:\n   - For each query, construct the `N-th` row using the above logic.\n   - Count how many times `T` appears as a substring in this row.\n\n4. **Optimize for Multiple Queries**:\n   - Precompute the occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S` to speed up counting in larger rows.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    len_S = length of S\n    len_T = length of T\n    precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S\n    results = []\n    for each query N in queries:\n        full_cycles = N // len_S\n        remainder = N % len_S\n        count = full_cycles * occurrences of T in a single cycle\n        construct the remainder part of the row\n        count += occurrences of T in the remainder part\n        append count to results\n    return results\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    len_S = len(S)\n    len_T = len(T)\n    \n    # Precompute occurrences of T in a single cycle of S\n    cycle_count = 0\n    for i in range(len_S - len_T + 1):\n        if S[i:i+len_T] == T:\n            cycle_count += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    for N in queries:\n        full_cycles = N // len_S\n        remainder = N % len_S\n        \n        # Count occurrences in full cycles\n        count = full_cycles * cycle_count\n        \n        # Construct the remainder part of the row\n        remainder_part = (S * 2)[:remainder]  # S * 2 to handle wrap-around\n        for i in range(remainder - len_T + 1):\n            if remainder_part[i:i+len_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        results.append(count)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# S = \"codechef\"\n# T = \"chefcode\"\n# queries = [4, 12, 1455]\n# print(count_occurrences(S, T, queries))\n```\n\nThis code efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the cyclic nature of the pyramid rows and precomputing occurrences of `T` in a single cycle of `S`. It then uses this precomputed information to quickly answer each query.",
