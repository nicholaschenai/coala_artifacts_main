    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   Mr. Krabs wants to steal the maximum amount of money from a series of rooms arranged in a row. Each room is initially locked, and only the two rooms at the ends can be unlocked first. Mr. Krabs has a limited number of keys, and each key can unlock one room. Once a room is unlocked, adjacent rooms can be unlocked. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money Mr. Krabs can collect using the available keys.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start by considering the two rooms at the ends, as these are the only ones that can be unlocked initially.\n   - Use a sliding window approach to evaluate the maximum sum of money that can be collected by unlocking a contiguous sequence of rooms with the available keys.\n   - The sliding window should start from either end and expand inward, considering the maximum sum of money that can be collected by unlocking `k` rooms.\n   - Calculate the sum of money for each possible window of `k` rooms and keep track of the maximum sum encountered.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function maxMoney(n, A, k):\n       if k == n:\n           return sum(A)  # If keys are equal to rooms, unlock all rooms\n       \n       max_money = 0\n       \n       # Check from the left side\n       for i from 0 to k:\n           left_sum = sum(A[0:i])  # Sum of first i rooms\n           right_sum = sum(A[n-(k-i):n])  # Sum of last (k-i) rooms\n           max_money = max(max_money, left_sum + right_sum)\n       \n       return max_money\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef maxMoney(n, A, k):\n    # If the number of keys is equal to the number of rooms, unlock all rooms\n    if k == n:\n        return sum(A)\n    \n    max_money = 0\n    \n    # Use a sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of money\n    # that can be collected by unlocking k rooms\n    for i in range(k + 1):\n        # Calculate the sum of money from the first i rooms\n        left_sum = sum(A[0:i])\n        # Calculate the sum of money from the last (k-i) rooms\n        right_sum = sum(A[n-(k-i):n])\n        # Update the maximum money collected\n        max_money = max(max_money, left_sum + right_sum)\n    \n    return max_money\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nn = int(data[0])\nA = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\nk = int(data[n+1])\n\n# Output the result\nprint(maxMoney(n, A, k))\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the maximum money Mr. Krabs can collect by using a sliding window approach to consider all possible combinations of unlocking `k` rooms starting from either end of the row of rooms.",
