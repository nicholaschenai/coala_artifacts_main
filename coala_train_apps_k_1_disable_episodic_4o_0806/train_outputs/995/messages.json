He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.\nMr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.\nEg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5\nOnly Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.\nEach room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.\n- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.\n- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.\n\n-----Output:-----\nMaximum money obtained.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5\n- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4\n- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100\n- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 1\n3\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n12\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nFor the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. \nThis is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each room is initially locked, and only the two rooms at the ends can be unlocked first. He has a limited number of keys, and each key can unlock one room. Once a room is unlocked, he can unlock its adjacent rooms. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect using the given number of keys.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initial Access**: Mr. Krabs can start unlocking from either the leftmost or the rightmost room.\n2. **Unlocking Strategy**: After unlocking a room, he can only unlock its adjacent rooms.\n3. **Maximizing Money**: To maximize the money, Mr. Krabs should choose the sequence of rooms that yields the highest sum of money with the given number of keys.\n4. **Sliding Window Approach**: Use a sliding window technique to evaluate the maximum sum of money that can be collected by unlocking a contiguous sequence of rooms starting from either end.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize `max_money` to 0.\n2. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the left end.\n3. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the right end.\n4. Use a sliding window to adjust the sum by moving one room from the left end to the right end:\n   - For each possible split of keys between the left and right ends:\n     - Calculate the sum of money by taking some rooms from the left and the rest from the right.\n     - Update `max_money` if the current sum is greater.\n5. Output `max_money`.\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_money(n, A, k):\n    # Initialize the maximum money to 0\n    max_money = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the left\n    left_sum = sum(A[:k])\n    max_money = max(max_money, left_sum)\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the right\n    right_sum = sum(A[-k:])\n    max_money = max(max_money, right_sum)\n    \n    # Use a sliding window to calculate the maximum money obtainable\n    # by taking some rooms from the left and the rest from the right\n    current_left_sum = 0\n    current_right_sum = sum(A[-k:])\n    \n    for i in range(k):\n        current_left_sum += A[i]\n        current_right_sum -= A[n - k + i]\n        current_sum = current_left_sum + current_right_sum\n        max_money = max(max_money, current_sum)\n    \n    return max_money\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nn = int(data[0])\nA = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\nk = int(data[n+1])\n\n# Output the result\nprint(max_money(n, A, k))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We first calculate the sum of the first `k` rooms from both the left and right ends.\n- We then use a sliding window approach to adjust the sum by moving one room from the left end to the right end, updating the maximum sum found.\n- The function `max_money` returns the maximum sum of money that can be collected with the given number of keys."

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The key insight is to use a sliding window approach to evaluate different combinations of rooms that can be unlocked with the available keys.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Sliding Window Approach:**\n   - Both solutions use a sliding window technique to consider different combinations of rooms that can be unlocked. This approach efficiently calculates the maximum sum of money by evaluating contiguous sequences of rooms.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases:**\n   - My solution explicitly checks if the number of keys equals the number of rooms, in which case all rooms can be unlocked. This is a straightforward optimization that avoids unnecessary calculations.\n\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Combinations:**\n   - My solution iterates over possible combinations by considering sums from the left and right ends of the room array. The official solution uses a similar approach but iterates in a slightly different manner, adjusting indices to calculate sums from both ends.\n\n### Differences and Similarities:\n\n- **Index Management:**\n  - My solution uses a loop to iterate from 0 to `k` and calculates sums for the first `i` rooms and the last `(k-i)` rooms. The official solution uses negative indexing to achieve a similar effect, which is a clever way to handle the problem but might be less intuitive for some readers.\n\n- **Efficiency:**\n  - Both solutions are efficient and operate in O(k) time complexity, which is suitable given the constraints. The use of list slicing and sum calculations is common in both solutions.\n\nOverall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively solve it using similar strategies. The official solution's use of negative indexing is a neat trick that can be useful in other problems involving circular or wrap-around logic."
