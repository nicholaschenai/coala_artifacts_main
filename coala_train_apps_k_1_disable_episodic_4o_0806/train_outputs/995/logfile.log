## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Mr. Krabs wants to maximize the amount of money he can steal from a row of rooms. Each room is initially locked, and only the two rooms at the ends can be unlocked first. He has a limited number of keys, and each key can unlock one room. Once a room is unlocked, he can unlock its adjacent rooms. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect using the given number of keys.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initial Access**: Mr. Krabs can start unlocking from either the leftmost or the rightmost room.
2. **Unlocking Strategy**: After unlocking a room, he can only unlock its adjacent rooms.
3. **Maximizing Money**: To maximize the money, Mr. Krabs should choose the sequence of rooms that yields the highest sum of money with the given number of keys.
4. **Sliding Window Approach**: Use a sliding window technique to evaluate the maximum sum of money that can be collected by unlocking a contiguous sequence of rooms starting from either end.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize `max_money` to 0.
2. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the left end.
3. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the right end.
4. Use a sliding window to adjust the sum by moving one room from the left end to the right end:
   - For each possible split of keys between the left and right ends:
     - Calculate the sum of money by taking some rooms from the left and the rest from the right.
     - Update `max_money` if the current sum is greater.
5. Output `max_money`.

### Python Solution

```python
def max_money(n, A, k):
    # Initialize the maximum money to 0
    max_money = 0
    
    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the left
    left_sum = sum(A[:k])
    max_money = max(max_money, left_sum)
    
    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the right
    right_sum = sum(A[-k:])
    max_money = max(max_money, right_sum)
    
    # Use a sliding window to calculate the maximum money obtainable
    # by taking some rooms from the left and the rest from the right
    current_left_sum = 0
    current_right_sum = sum(A[-k:])
    
    for i in range(k):
        current_left_sum += A[i]
        current_right_sum -= A[n - k + i]
        current_sum = current_left_sum + current_right_sum
        max_money = max(max_money, current_sum)
    
    return max_money

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

n = int(data[0])
A = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))
k = int(data[n+1])

# Output the result
print(max_money(n, A, k))
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first calculate the sum of the first `k` rooms from both the left and right ends.
- We then use a sliding window approach to adjust the sum by moving one room from the left end to the right end, updating the maximum sum found.
- The function `max_money` returns the maximum sum of money that can be collected with the given number of keys.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 995 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   Mr. Krabs wants to steal the maximum amount of money from a series of rooms arranged in a row. Each room is initially locked, and only the two rooms at the ends can be unlocked first. Mr. Krabs has a limited number of keys, and each key can unlock one room. Once a room is unlocked, adjacent rooms can be unlocked. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money Mr. Krabs can collect using the available keys.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Start by considering the two rooms at the ends, as these are the only ones that can be unlocked initially.
   - Use a sliding window approach to evaluate the maximum sum of money that can be collected by unlocking a contiguous sequence of rooms with the available keys.
   - The sliding window should start from either end and expand inward, considering the maximum sum of money that can be collected by unlocking `k` rooms.
   - Calculate the sum of money for each possible window of `k` rooms and keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function maxMoney(n, A, k):
       if k == n:
           return sum(A)  # If keys are equal to rooms, unlock all rooms
       
       max_money = 0
       
       # Check from the left side
       for i from 0 to k:
           left_sum = sum(A[0:i])  # Sum of first i rooms
           right_sum = sum(A[n-(k-i):n])  # Sum of last (k-i) rooms
           max_money = max(max_money, left_sum + right_sum)
       
       return max_money
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def maxMoney(n, A, k):
    # If the number of keys is equal to the number of rooms, unlock all rooms
    if k == n:
        return sum(A)
    
    max_money = 0
    
    # Use a sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of money
    # that can be collected by unlocking k rooms
    for i in range(k + 1):
        # Calculate the sum of money from the first i rooms
        left_sum = sum(A[0:i])
        # Calculate the sum of money from the last (k-i) rooms
        right_sum = sum(A[n-(k-i):n])
        # Update the maximum money collected
        max_money = max(max_money, left_sum + right_sum)
    
    return max_money

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
n = int(data[0])
A = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))
k = int(data[n+1])

# Output the result
print(maxMoney(n, A, k))
```

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum money Mr. Krabs can collect by using a sliding window approach to consider all possible combinations of unlocking `k` rooms starting from either end of the row of rooms.

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to maximize the amount of money Mr. Krabs could collect from a series of locked rooms using a limited number of keys. The key challenge was to efficiently determine which rooms to unlock given that only the two end rooms could be accessed initially.

The core concept involved using a sliding window approach to evaluate the maximum sum of money that could be collected by unlocking a contiguous sequence of rooms. This approach was effective because it allowed us to consider all possible combinations of unlocking `k` rooms starting from either end of the row of rooms.

The strategy that worked was to iterate over possible splits of the `k` keys between the left and right ends of the room sequence. For each split, we calculated the sum of money from the first `i` rooms and the last `(k-i)` rooms, and tracked the maximum sum encountered.

The solution was straightforward and efficient, leveraging the constraints and properties of the problem to avoid unnecessary computations. The sliding window technique was particularly useful in handling the problem's constraints, ensuring that the solution was both optimal and scalable for large inputs.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution aim to maximize the amount of money Mr. Krabs can collect by unlocking a limited number of rooms. The key insight is to use a sliding window approach to evaluate different combinations of rooms that can be unlocked with the available keys.

### Key Insights:

1. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - Both solutions use a sliding window technique to consider different combinations of rooms that can be unlocked. This approach efficiently calculates the maximum sum of money by evaluating contiguous sequences of rooms.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - My solution explicitly checks if the number of keys equals the number of rooms, in which case all rooms can be unlocked. This is a straightforward optimization that avoids unnecessary calculations.

3. **Iterating Over Possible Combinations:**
   - My solution iterates over possible combinations by considering sums from the left and right ends of the room array. The official solution uses a similar approach but iterates in a slightly different manner, adjusting indices to calculate sums from both ends.

### Differences and Similarities:

- **Index Management:**
  - My solution uses a loop to iterate from 0 to `k` and calculates sums for the first `i` rooms and the last `(k-i)` rooms. The official solution uses negative indexing to achieve a similar effect, which is a clever way to handle the problem but might be less intuitive for some readers.

- **Efficiency:**
  - Both solutions are efficient and operate in O(k) time complexity, which is suitable given the constraints. The use of list slicing and sum calculations is common in both solutions.

Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively solve it using similar strategies. The official solution's use of negative indexing is a neat trick that can be useful in other problems involving circular or wrap-around logic.
