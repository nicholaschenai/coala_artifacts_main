This data structure holds information about array of N elements and can process two types of operations:\n\n- Add some value to ith element of the array\n- Calculate sum of all elements on any prefix of the array\n\nBoth operations take O(log N) time. This data structure is also well known for its low memory usage. To be more precise, it needs exactly the same amount of memory as that of array.\n\nGiven some array A, first we build data structure in some other array T. Ti stores the sum of the elements Astart, Astart + 1, ..., Ai. Index start is calculated with formula start = Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1)). Here \"&\" denotes bitwise AND operation.\nSo, in order to find a sum of elements A0, A1, ..., AL you start with index L and calculate sum of TL + TFdown(L)-1 + TFdown(Fdown(L)-1)-1 + ... + TFdown(Fdown(...(Fdown(L)-1)-1)-1. Usually it is performed with cycle that goes from L down to 0 with function Fdown and sums some elements from T. Chef wants to verify that the time complexity to calculate sum of A0, A1, A2, ..., AL is O(log L). In order to do so, he wonders how many times he has to access array T to calculate this sum. Help him to find this out.\nSince Chef works with really big indices. The value of L can be very large and is provided to you in binary representation as concatenation of strings L1, L2 repeated N times and string L3.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains three non-empty strings L1, L2, L3 and an integer N. Strings will contain only characters 0 and 1. To obtain binary representation of index L concatenate L1 with L2 repeated N times and with L3. You are guaranteed that the index will be positive.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line containing number of times Fenwick tree data structure will access array T in order to compute sum of A0, A1, A2, ..., AL.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 300\n- 1 \u2264 Length(Li) \u2264 1000\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 106\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask #1 (20 points): |L1| + |L2| * N + |L3| \u2264 60\n- Subtask #2 (30 points): 1 \u2264 T \u2264 30, 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n- Subtask #3 (50 points): No additional constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n4\n001 100 011 4\n1000 1101 100 3\n1010 001 101 4\n010 101 000 4\n\nOutput:\n6\n12\n8\n10\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The index `L` is provided in a binary format, constructed by concatenating three binary strings `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3`. The task is to calculate the number of accesses to the array `T` for each test case.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Fenwick Tree Access Pattern**: \n   - The Fenwick tree uses a function `Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1))` to determine the next index to access. This function effectively clears the lowest set bit of `i`.\n   - To compute the sum up to index `L`, we start at `L` and repeatedly apply `Fdown` until we reach 0.\n\n2. **Count the Number of Accesses**:\n   - The number of accesses is equivalent to the number of times we can apply `Fdown` before reaching 0.\n   - This is equal to the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `L`.\n\n3. **Construct the Index `L`**:\n   - Concatenate `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3` to form the binary string representation of `L`.\n   - Convert this binary string to an integer.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Set Bits**:\n   - For each test case, compute the number of set bits in the integer representation of `L`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_set_bits(binary_string):\n    convert binary_string to integer\n    count the number of 1s in the binary representation of the integer\n    return the count\n\nfunction process_test_cases(test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        extract L1, L2, L3, N from test_case\n        construct L as L1 + (L2 * N) + L3\n        count = count_set_bits(L)\n        print count\n\nread number of test cases T\ninitialize an empty list test_cases\nfor each test case:\n    read L1, L2, L3, N\n    append (L1, L2, L3, N) to test_cases\n\nprocess_test_cases(test_cases)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_set_bits(binary_string):\n    # Convert the binary string to an integer\n    number = int(binary_string, 2)\n    # Count the number of 1s in the binary representation of the number\n    return bin(number).count('1')\n\ndef process_test_cases(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for L1, L2, L3, N in test_cases:\n        # Construct the binary string representation of L\n        L = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3\n        # Count the number of set bits in L\n        count = count_set_bits(L)\n        # Store the result\n        results.append(count)\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split('\\n')\n    \n    # Read number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    # Read each test case\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        L1, L2, L3, N = data[i].split()\n        N = int(N)\n        test_cases.append((L1, L2, L3, N))\n    \n    # Process all test cases\n    results = process_test_cases(test_cases)\n    \n    # Output results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case to construct the binary representation of `L`, counts the set bits, and outputs the result for each test case."

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output.

The task is to compute the number of accesses to the array `T` for each test case.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Fenwick Tree Access**: The Fenwick tree accesses the array `T` by repeatedly applying the function `Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1)) - 1` until `i` becomes negative. Each application of `Fdown` corresponds to an access to `T`.\n\n2. **Binary Representation**: The index `L` is given in binary form by concatenating `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3`. We need to convert this binary string to a decimal number to simulate the Fenwick tree operations.\n\n3. **Counting Accesses**: For a given index `L`, count how many times we can apply `Fdown` before `i` becomes negative.
