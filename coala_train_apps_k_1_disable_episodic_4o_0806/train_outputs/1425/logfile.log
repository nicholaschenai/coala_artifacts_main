## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef has just learned a new data structure - Fenwick tree. This data structure holds information about array of N elements and can process two types of operations:

- Add some value to ith element of the array
- Calculate sum of all elements on any prefix of the array

Both operations take O(log N) time. This data structure is also well known for its low memory usage. To be more precise, it needs exactly the same amount of memory as that of array.

Given some array A, first we build data structure in some other array T. Ti stores the sum of the elements Astart, Astart + 1, ..., Ai. Index start is calculated with formula start = Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1)). Here "&" denotes bitwise AND operation.
So, in order to find a sum of elements A0, A1, ..., AL you start with index L and calculate sum of TL + TFdown(L)-1 + TFdown(Fdown(L)-1)-1 + ... + TFdown(Fdown(...(Fdown(L)-1)-1)-1. Usually it is performed with cycle that goes from L down to 0 with function Fdown and sums some elements from T. Chef wants to verify that the time complexity to calculate sum of A0, A1, A2, ..., AL is O(log L). In order to do so, he wonders how many times he has to access array T to calculate this sum. Help him to find this out.
Since Chef works with really big indices. The value of L can be very large and is provided to you in binary representation as concatenation of strings L1, L2 repeated N times and string L3.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains three non-empty strings L1, L2, L3 and an integer N. Strings will contain only characters 0 and 1. To obtain binary representation of index L concatenate L1 with L2 repeated N times and with L3. You are guaranteed that the index will be positive.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing number of times Fenwick tree data structure will access array T in order to compute sum of A0, A1, A2, ..., AL.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 300
- 1 â‰¤ Length(Li) â‰¤ 1000

INFO - [Task id] 1425 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine how many times a Fenwick tree accesses its internal array `T` to compute the sum of elements from the start of an array `A` up to a given index `L`. The index `L` is provided in a binary format, constructed by concatenating three binary strings `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3`. The task is to calculate the number of accesses to the array `T` for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Fenwick Tree Access Pattern**: 
   - The Fenwick tree uses a function `Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1))` to determine the next index to access. This function effectively clears the lowest set bit of `i`.
   - To compute the sum up to index `L`, we start at `L` and repeatedly apply `Fdown` until we reach 0.

2. **Count the Number of Accesses**:
   - The number of accesses is equivalent to the number of times we can apply `Fdown` before reaching 0.
   - This is equal to the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `L`.

3. **Construct the Index `L`**:
   - Concatenate `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3` to form the binary string representation of `L`.
   - Convert this binary string to an integer.

4. **Calculate the Number of Set Bits**:
   - For each test case, compute the number of set bits in the integer representation of `L`.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_set_bits(binary_string):
    convert binary_string to integer
    count the number of 1s in the binary representation of the integer
    return the count

function process_test_cases(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        extract L1, L2, L3, N from test_case
        construct L as L1 + (L2 * N) + L3
        count = count_set_bits(L)
        print count

read number of test cases T
initialize an empty list test_cases
for each test case:
    read L1, L2, L3, N
    append (L1, L2, L3, N) to test_cases

process_test_cases(test_cases)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_set_bits(binary_string):
    # Convert the binary string to an integer
    number = int(binary_string, 2)
    # Count the number of 1s in the binary representation of the number
    return bin(number).count('1')

def process_test_cases(test_cases):
    results = []
    for L1, L2, L3, N in test_cases:
        # Construct the binary string representation of L
        L = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3
        # Count the number of set bits in L
        count = count_set_bits(L)
        # Store the result
        results.append(count)
    return results

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split('\n')
    
    # Read number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    
    # Read each test case
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        L1, L2, L3, N = data[i].split()
        N = int(N)
        test_cases.append((L1, L2, L3, N))
    
    # Process all test cases
    results = process_test_cases(test_cases)
    
    # Output results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input, processes each test case to construct the binary representation of `L`, counts the set bits, and outputs the result for each test case.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

INFO - [Task id] 1425 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine how many times a Fenwick tree accesses its internal array `T` to compute the sum of elements from the start of an array `A` up to a given index `L`. The index `L` is provided in a binary format, constructed by concatenating three binary strings `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3`. The task is to compute the number of accesses to the array `T` for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Fenwick Tree Access**: The Fenwick tree accesses the array `T` by repeatedly applying the function `Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1)) - 1` until `i` becomes negative. Each application of `Fdown` corresponds to an access to `T`.

2. **Binary Representation**: The index `L` is given in binary form by concatenating `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3`. We need to convert this binary string to a decimal number to simulate the Fenwick tree operations.

3. **Counting Accesses**: For a given index `L`, count how many times we can apply `Fdown` before `i` becomes negative. This count is the number of accesses to `T`.

## Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read strings `L1`, `L2`, `L3`, and integer `N`.
   - Construct the binary string `L` by concatenating `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3`.
   - Convert the binary string `L` to a decimal integer.
   - Initialize a counter for accesses.
   - While `L` is non-negative:
     - Increment the access counter.
     - Update `L` using `L = (L & (L + 1)) - 1`.
   - Output the access counter.

## Python Code

```python
def count_fenwick_accesses(L1, L2, L3, N):
    # Construct the binary string for L
    L_binary = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3
    # Convert the binary string to an integer
    L = int(L_binary, 2)
    
    # Count the number of accesses
    accesses = 0

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef has just learned a new data structure - Fenwick tree. This data structure holds information about array of N elements and can process two types of operations:

- Add some value to ith element of the array
- Calculate sum of all elements on any prefix of the array

Both operations take O(log N) time. This data structure is also well known for its low memory usage. To be more precise, it needs exactly the same amount of memory as that of array.

Given some array A, first we build data structure in some other array T. Ti stores the sum of the elements Astart, Astart + 1, ..., Ai. Index start is calculated with formula start = Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1)). Here "&" denotes bitwise AND operation.
So, in order to find a sum of elements A0, A1, ..., AL you start with index L and calculate sum of TL + TFdown(L)-1 + TFdown(Fdown(L)-1)-1 + ... + TFdown(Fdown(...(Fdown(L)-1)-1)-1. Usually it is performed with cycle that goes from L down to 0 with function Fdown and sums some elements from T. Chef wants to verify that the time complexity to calculate sum of A0, A1, A2, ..., AL is O(log L). In order to do so, he wonders how many times he has to access array T to calculate this sum. Help him to find this out.
Since Chef works with really big indices. The value of L can be very large and is provided to you in binary representation as concatenation of strings L1, L2 repeated N times and string L3.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains three non-empty strings L1, L2, L3 and an integer N. Strings will contain only characters 0 and 1. To obtain binary representation of index L concatenate L1 with L2 repeated N times and with L3. You are guaranteed that the index will be positive.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing number of times Fenwick tree data structure will access array T in order to compute sum of A0, A1, A2, ..., AL.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 300

INFO - [Task id] 1425 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine how many times a Fenwick tree accesses its internal array `T` to compute the sum of elements from the start of an array `A` up to a given index `L`. The index `L` is provided in a binary format, constructed by concatenating three binary strings `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3`. The task is to compute the number of accesses to the array `T` for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Fenwick Tree Access**: The Fenwick tree accesses the array `T` by repeatedly applying the function `Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1)) - 1` until `i` becomes negative. Each application of `Fdown` corresponds to an access to `T`.

2. **Binary Representation**: The index `L` is given in binary form by concatenating `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3`. We need to convert this binary string to a decimal number to simulate the Fenwick tree operations.

3. **Counting Accesses**: For a given index `L`, count how many times we can apply `Fdown` before `i` becomes negative. This count is the number of accesses to `T`.

## Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read strings `L1`, `L2`, `L3`, and integer `N`.
   - Construct the binary string `L` by concatenating `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3`.
   - Convert the binary string `L` to a decimal integer.
   - Initialize a counter for accesses.
   - While `L` is non-negative:
     - Increment the access counter.
     - Update `L` using `L = (L & (L + 1)) - 1`.
   - Output the access counter.

## Python Code

```python
def count_fenwick_accesses(L1, L2, L3, N):
    # Construct the binary string for L
    L_binary = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3
    # Convert the binary string to an integer
    L = int(L_binary, 2)
    
    # Count the number of accesses
    accesses = 0
    while L >= 0:
        accesses += 1
        L = (L & (L + 1)) - 1
    
    return accesses

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        L1 = data[index]
        L2 = data[index + 1]
        L3 = data[index + 2]
        N = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        
        result = count_fenwick_accesses(L1, L2, L3, N)
        results.append(str(result))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

main()
```

This code reads input, constructs the binary representation of `L`, calculates the number of accesses to the Fenwick tree's array `T`, and outputs the result for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 1425 [generation text] In this problem, I worked with the Fenwick tree data structure to determine the number of accesses required to compute a prefix sum up to a given index `L`. The index `L` was provided in a binary format, constructed by concatenating three binary strings with one of them repeated multiple times. The core concept was understanding how the Fenwick tree uses the function `Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1)) - 1` to traverse its internal array `T`.

The main challenge was efficiently handling the potentially large size of `L` due to the repetition of `L2`. By constructing `L` as a binary string and converting it to a decimal integer, I could simulate the Fenwick tree's access pattern. The solution involved iterating over `L` using the `Fdown` function until `L` became negative, counting each access.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding bitwise operations and their applications in data structures like the Fenwick tree. The solution was efficient and handled large inputs by leveraging Python's ability to work with large integers. The approach was straightforward once the problem was broken down into constructing the binary representation and simulating the access pattern.

INFO - [Task id] 1425 [generation text] The problem of determining the number of accesses to a Fenwick tree's internal array `T` was straightforward, and my solution aligned well with the official solution. Both solutions correctly constructed the binary representation of the index `L` and used the same logic to count the number of accesses by iteratively applying the function `Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1)) - 1`.

Key insights from the problem-solving process include:

1. **Binary String Construction**: Both solutions effectively constructed the binary string `L` by concatenating `L1`, `L2` repeated `N` times, and `L3`. This step is crucial for accurately representing the index `L` in binary form.

2. **Iterative Access Counting**: The core logic of counting accesses by iteratively applying the `Fdown` function until the index becomes negative was correctly implemented in both solutions. This approach leverages the properties of the Fenwick tree to efficiently determine the number of accesses.

3. **Efficiency**: Both solutions operate efficiently within the constraints, as they only involve simple string manipulations and bitwise operations, which are computationally inexpensive.

Overall, the problem reinforced the understanding of Fenwick trees and the use of bitwise operations to efficiently solve problems related to them. The official solution was concise and effective, mirroring the approach I took, which confirms the correctness and efficiency of the method used.

The problem demonstrates how to construct a large index from binary strings and calculate the number of accesses required to compute a prefix sum using the Fenwick tree's properties. This is particularly relevant in competitive programming and situations where memory efficiency and fast query times are crucial, such as in real-time data processing or large-scale data analysis. Understanding the bit manipulation involved in the Fenwick tree operations can also be beneficial for optimizing algorithms that require frequent updates and queries on cumulative data.",
