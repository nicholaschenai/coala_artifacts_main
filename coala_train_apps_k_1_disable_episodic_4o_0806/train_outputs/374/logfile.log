INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a list of strings, and we need to find the shortest string that contains each of the given strings as a substring. Importantly, no string in the list is a substring of another string in the list. The order of the strings in the final result does not matter as long as all strings are included as substrings.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Overlap**: For each pair of strings, determine the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of another. This overlap will help in minimizing the length of the final superstring.

2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each string is a node. The edge weight between two nodes (strings) is the overlap length. The goal is to find a path that visits all nodes (strings) and minimizes the total length of the superstring.

3. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking**: Use dynamic programming to explore all possible combinations of strings. Use a bitmask to represent the set of strings included in the current superstring. For each state, keep track of the last string added to the superstring and the current length of the superstring.

4. **Reconstruct the Solution**: Once the optimal path is found using dynamic programming, reconstruct the superstring by backtracking through the states.

## Pseudocode

1. **Calculate Overlaps**:
   - For each pair of strings `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of `A[i]` matches the prefix of `A[j]`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Let `dp[mask][i]` be the minimum length of a superstring that contains the set of strings represented by `mask` and ends with the string `A[i]`.
   - Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` to the length of `A[i]` for each string `i`.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each `mask` and each string `i` in `mask`, try to extend the superstring by adding another string `j` not in `mask`.
   - Update `dp[mask | (1 << j)][j]` using the overlap between `A[i]` and `A[j]`.

4. **Reconstruct the Superstring**:
   - Start from the state with all strings included and backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the reconstructed superstring.

                    new_length = dp[mask][i] + len(A[j]) - overlap[i][j]
                    if new_length < dp[new_mask][j]:
                        dp[new_mask][j] = new_length

    ### Shortest non-appearing string

    Given a string $S$ and a certain alphabet.
    We have to find a string of smallest length, that doesn't appear in $S$.

    We will apply dynamic programming on the suffix automaton built for the string $S$.

    Let $d[v]$ be the answer for the node $v$, i.e. we already processed part of the substring, are currently in the state $v$, and want to find the smallest number of characters that have to be added to find a non-existent transition.
    Computing $d[v]$ is very simple.
    If there is not transition using at least one character of the alphabet, then $d[v] = 1$.
    Otherwise one character is not enough, and so we need to take the minimum of all answers of all transitions:

    $$d[v] = 1 + \min_{w:(v,w,c) \in SA} d[w].$$

    The answer to the problem will be $d[t_0]$, and the actual string can be restored using the computed array $d[]$.

    ### Longest common substring of two strings

    Given two strings $S$ and $T$.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in $S$ and also in $T$.

    We construct a suffix automaton for the string $S$.

    We will now take the string $T$, and for each prefix look for the longest suffix of this prefix in $S$.
    In other words, for each position in the string $T$, we want to find the longest common substring of $S$ and $T$ ending in that position.

    For this we will use two variables, the **current state** $v$, and the **current length** $l$.
    These two variables will describe the current matching part: its length and the state that corresponds to it.

    Initially $v = t_0$ and $l = 0$, i.e. the match is empty.

    Now let us describe how we can add a character $T[i]$ and recalculate the answer for it.

      - If there is a transition from $v$ with the character $T[i]$, then we simply follow the transition and increase $l$ by one.
      - If there is no such transition, we have to shorten the current matching part, which means that we need to follow the suffix link: $v = link(v)$.
        At the same time, the current length has to be shortened.
        Obviously we need to assign $l = len(v)$, since after passing through the suffix link we end up in state whose corresponding longest string is a substring.
      - If there is still no transition using the required character, we repeat and again go through the suffix link and decrease $l$, until we find a transition or we reach the fictional state $-1$ (which means that the symbol $T[i]$ doesn't appear at all in $S$, so we assign $v = l = 0$).

    The answer to the task will be the maximum of all the values $l$.

    The complexity of this part is $O(length(T))$, since in one move we can either increase $l$ by one, or make several passes through the suffix links, each one ends up reducing the value $l$.

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    string lcs (string S, string T) {
        sa_init();
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++)
            sa_extend(S[i]);
 
        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {
            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st[v].link ;
                l = st[v].len;
            }
            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st [v].next[T[i]];
                l++;
            }
            if (l > best) {
                best = l;
                bestpos = i;
            }
        }
        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);
    } 
    ```

    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings

    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.

    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):

    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \dots + S_k + D_k.$$

    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.

    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.
    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \dots, D_k$.

    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.
    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.
    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a list of strings, and we need to find the shortest string that contains each of the given strings as a substring. None of the strings in the list is a substring of another. The solution should be able to handle up to 12 strings, each with a length of up to 20 characters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively merge strings by overlapping them as much as possible. We can calculate the overlap between two strings and use this information to build the shortest superstring. We will use a dynamic programming table to store the shortest superstring that can be formed using a subset of the strings, and we will update this table as we consider each string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function to calculate the overlap between two strings.
   Initialize a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset of strings.
   Initialize a table to store the path to reconstruct the superstring.
   For each subset of strings:
       For each string in the subset:
           Calculate the shortest superstring by considering the overlap with other strings.
           Update the DP table with the shortest superstring length.
           Update the path table to keep track of the order of strings.
   Reconstruct the shortest superstring using the path table.
   Return the shortest superstring.
   ```

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the shortest superstring by considering all possible overlaps between the strings. The `overlap` function calculates the maximum overlap between two strings, which is used to update the DP table. The `path` table helps reconstruct the order of strings in the final superstring.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a list of strings, and we need to find the shortest string that contains each of the given strings as a substring. None of the strings in the list is a substring of another. The solution should be able to handle up to 12 strings, each with a length of up to 20 characters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively merge strings by overlapping them as much as possible. We can calculate the overlap between two strings and use this information to build the shortest superstring. We will use a dynamic programming table to store the shortest superstring that can be formed using a subset of the strings, and we will update this table as we consider each string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function to calculate the overlap between two strings.
   Initialize a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset of strings.
   Initialize a table to store the path to reconstruct the superstring.
   For each subset of strings:
       For each string in the subset:
           Calculate the shortest superstring by considering the overlap with other strings.
           Update the DP table with the shortest superstring length.
           Update the path table to keep track of the order of strings.
   Reconstruct the shortest superstring using the path table.
   Return the shortest superstring.

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] In tackling the problem of finding the shortest superstring that contains each string in a given list as a substring, I employed a dynamic programming approach combined with a greedy strategy to maximize overlaps between strings. The core concept was to iteratively merge strings by calculating the maximum overlap between pairs of strings and using this information to build the shortest possible superstring.

The solution involved setting up a dynamic programming (DP) table to store the length of the shortest superstring for each subset of strings, and a path table to track the order of strings for reconstructing the superstring. The overlap function was crucial in determining how much of one string could be appended to another without redundancy.

One key insight was the use of bitmasking to efficiently represent subsets of strings, which allowed for a compact and efficient DP solution. The challenge was ensuring that the DP table was correctly updated with the maximum overlap values, which required careful iteration over all possible subsets and string pairs.

The solution was successful, passing all test cases, and demonstrated the power of combining dynamic programming with greedy strategies for optimization problems involving string manipulation. This approach is particularly useful in problems where the goal is to minimize or maximize a certain property (like length) while satisfying a set of constraints (like containing all substrings).

```

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the shortest superstring by considering all possible overlaps between the strings. The `overlap` function calculates the maximum overlap between two strings, which is used to update the DP table. The `path` table helps reconstruct the order of strings in the final superstring.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

1. **Problem Understanding and Approach:**
   - The problem requires finding the shortest superstring that contains all given strings as substrings. The challenge is to efficiently merge strings by maximizing overlaps.
   - My initial approach used dynamic programming to track overlaps and reconstruct the superstring, which is a valid strategy but can be complex to implement correctly.

2. **Official Solution Insights:**
   - The official solution uses a memoization technique to optimize the recursive calculation of the shortest superstring. This is a powerful approach to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
   - The `merge` function is used to concatenate two strings with the maximum possible overlap, which is a crucial step in minimizing the length of the superstring.
   - The `find_short` function recursively finds the shortest superstring for a given subset of strings, using memoization to store and reuse results.

3. **Key Differences and Improvements:**
   - The official solution simplifies the problem by using a recursive approach with memoization, which can be more intuitive and easier to manage than a full dynamic programming table.
   - The use of a decorator for memoization (`@memo`) is a neat way to cache results of recursive calls, reducing the need for manual management of a DP table.
   - The solution also includes a preprocessing step to remove any string that is a substring of another, which simplifies the problem space.

4. **Learning Points:**
   - Memoization can be a powerful tool in recursive solutions, especially when dealing with overlapping subproblems.
   - Simplifying the problem space by removing unnecessary elements (e.g., substrings) can lead to more efficient solutions.
   - The official solution's use of Python's functional programming features (like decorators) can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.

Overall, the official solution provides a more elegant and efficient approach to solving the problem, leveraging memoization and recursive strategies effectively. This experience highlights the importance of considering different algorithmic techniques and the potential benefits of simplifying the problem space before diving into complex implementations.

It then reconstructs the shortest superstring by tracing back through a path table that records the sequence of strings leading to the optimal solution. The final superstring is built by concatenating the strings in the order determined by the path, using the calculated overlaps to minimize the total length.
