    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the smallest substring in a given string `S` that contains all the characters of another string `T`. If no such substring exists, we return an empty string. The solution should be efficient, ideally with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We'll use a sliding window approach to find the minimum window in `S` that contains all characters of `T`.\n2. **Character Count**: We'll maintain a count of characters needed from `T` and a count of characters in the current window of `S`.\n3. **Expand and Contract**: We'll expand the window by moving the right pointer to include more characters and contract it by moving the left pointer to find the minimum window.\n4. **Check Validity**: At each step, we'll check if the current window contains all characters of `T` by comparing the counts.\n5. **Update Minimum**: If a valid window is found, update the minimum window size and position.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a dictionary `t_count` to store the count of each character in `T`.\n2. Initialize a dictionary `window_count` to store the count of characters in the current window of `S`.\n3. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to 0, and variables `min_len` to infinity and `min_window` to an empty string.\n4. Initialize a variable `formed` to track how many unique characters from `T` are currently in the window with the required frequency.\n5. Iterate with `right` over `S`:\n   - Add the character at `right` to `window_count`.\n   - If the character's count in `window_count` matches `t_count`, increment `formed`.\n   - While `formed` equals the number of unique characters in `T`:\n     - Update `min_len` and `min_window` if the current window is smaller.\n     - Remove the character at `left` from `window_count` and move `left` forward.\n     - If the character's count in `window_count` is less than `t_count`, decrement `formed`.\n6. Return `min_window`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        if not t or not s:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        # Dictionary to keep a count of all the unique characters in t.\n        t_count = {}\n        for char in t:\n            t_count[char] = t_count.get(char, 0) + 1\n        \n        # Number of unique characters in t that need to be present in the desired window.\n        required = len(t_count)\n        \n        # Left and Right pointer\n        left, right = 0, 0\n        \n        # Formed is used to keep track of how many unique characters in t\n        # are present in the current window in its desired frequency.\n        # e.g. if t is \"AABC\" then the window must have two A's, one B and one C.\n        formed = 0\n        \n        # Dictionary which keeps a count of all the unique characters in the current window.\n        window_count = {}\n        \n        # ans tuple of the form (window length, left, right)\n        min_len = float(\"inf\")\n        min_window = \"\"\n        \n        while right < len(s):\n            # Add one character from the right to the window\n            char = s[right]\n            window_count[char] = window_count.get(char, 0) + 1\n            \n            # If the frequency of the current character added equals to the\n            # desired count in t then increment the formed count by 1.\n            if char in t_count and window_count[char] == t_count[char]:\n                formed += 1\n            \n            # Try and contract the window till the point it ceases to be 'desirable'.\n            while left <= right and formed == required:\n                char = s[left]\n                \n                # Save the smallest window until now.\n                if right - left + 1 < min_len:\n                    min_len = right - left + 1\n                    min_window = s[left:right + 1]\n                \n                # The character at the position pointed by the `left` pointer is no longer a part of the window.\n                window_count[char] -= 1\n                if char in t_count and window_count[char] < t_count[char]:\n                    formed -= 1\n                \n                # Move the left pointer ahead, this would help to look for a new window.\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Keep expanding the window once we are done contracting.\n            right += 1\n        \n        return min_window\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the minimum window in `S` that contains all characters of `T` using a sliding window approach.",
