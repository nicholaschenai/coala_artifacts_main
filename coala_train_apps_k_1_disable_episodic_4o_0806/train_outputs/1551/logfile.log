INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given quote is "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy". A quote is considered "Real Fancy" if it contains the word "not" as a standalone word. If "not" is not present as a standalone word, the quote is "regularly fancy". We will be given multiple quotes to evaluate.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each quote, we need to check if the word "not" appears as a standalone word.
2. A standalone word means it is surrounded by spaces or is at the beginning or end of the string.
3. We will split each quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words.
4. If "not" is found, the quote is "Real Fancy". Otherwise, it is "regularly fancy".

## Pseudocode

```
function classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for each quote in quotes:
        split the quote into words
        if "not" is in the list of words:
            print "Real Fancy"
        else:
            print "regularly fancy"

read T from input
initialize an empty list for quotes
for i from 1 to T:
    read a quote and append to quotes list

call classify_quotes with T and quotes
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate over each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is a standalone word in the list
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
# Initialize a list to store the quotes
quotes = []
# Read each quote
for _ in range(T):
    quote = input().strip()
    quotes.append(quote)

# Classify each quote
classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and each quote, then checks if "not" is a standalone word in each quote. It prints "Real Fancy" if "not" is found, otherwise "regularly fancy".

    [description for function: main]
    The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer, and determines the winner of a game for each integer. It first reads the number of test cases, T, and then iterates over each test case to determine the winner using a helper function. The winner is determined based on whether the integer is 1, even, or odd, with specific rules for each case. The results for all test cases are collected in a list. Finally, it prints the winner for each test case in the order they were read.

    [end of description]
    This knowledge is useful in scenarios involving turn-based games where players can make strategic moves based on the properties of numbers, such as divisibility and parity. Understanding the winning strategy in this game can be applied to similar problems where the goal is to force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a move. This is particularly relevant in competitive programming, game theory, and algorithm design, where determining the optimal strategy is crucial. The problem also highlights the importance of recognizing patterns in numbers, such as even and odd properties, which can be generalized to other mathematical problems.

### Explanation

- We define a function `classify_quotes` that takes the number of test cases `T` and a list of `quotes`.
- For each quote, we split it into words using the `split()` method, which handles spaces and returns a list of words.
- We check if "not" is in the list of words. If it is, we print "Real Fancy". Otherwise, we print "regularly fancy".
- The `main` function reads input from standard input, processes it to extract the number of test cases and the quotes, and then calls `classify_quotes` to classify each quote.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not" as a standalone word. The core concept was to correctly identify "not" as a separate word, which required splitting the quote into words and checking for "not" in the resulting list. This approach ensures that "not" is not part of another word, such as "nothing".

The solution involved reading multiple quotes, splitting each quote into words using the `split()` method, and checking if "not" is present in the list of words. If found, the quote is classified as "Real Fancy"; otherwise, it is "regularly fancy". This method is efficient given the constraints, as it processes each quote in linear time relative to its length.

The problem was straightforward, and the solution worked as expected without any unexpected errors. The key takeaway is the importance of correctly handling word boundaries when searching for specific words in a text, which can be achieved using string splitting and list membership checks. This pattern is useful in text processing tasks where word-level analysis is required.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to classify quotes based on whether they contain the word "not" as a standalone word. If a quote contains "not" as a separate word, it is considered "Real Fancy". Otherwise, it is "regularly fancy". We will be given multiple quotes, and for each quote, we need to determine its classification.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each quote, we need to check if the word "not" appears as a standalone word.
2. A standalone word means it is surrounded by spaces or is at the beginning or end of the string.
3. We will split each quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words.
4. If "not" is found, classify the quote as "Real Fancy". Otherwise, classify it as "regularly fancy".

## Pseudocode

```
function classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for each quote in quotes:
        split the quote into words
        if "not" is in the list of words:
            print "Real Fancy"
        else:
            print "regularly fancy"

read T from input
initialize an empty list for quotes
for i from 1 to T:
    read a quote and append it to the quotes list

call classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is a standalone word in the list
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    # First line is the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    # The rest are the quotes
    quotes = data[1:T+1]
    
    classify_quotes(T, quotes)

main()
```

### Explanation

- We define a function `classify_quotes` that takes the number of test cases `T` and a list of `quotes`.
- For each quote, we split it into words using the `split()` method, which handles spaces and returns a list of words.
- We check if "not" is in the list of words. If it is, we print "Real Fancy". Otherwise, we print "regularly fancy".
- The `main` function reads input from standard input, processes it to extract the number of test cases and the quotes, and then calls `classify_quotes` to classify each quote.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
# cook your dish here
import re
t=int(input())
while(t>0):
 s=list(input().split(' '))
 if("not" in s):
  print("Real Fancy")
 else:
  print("regularly fancy")
 t=t-1

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of classifying quotes based on the presence of the word "not" as a standalone word. The key insight is to split the quote into words and check for the presence of "not" in the resulting list. This approach ensures that "not" is treated as a separate word, not as a substring of another word.

The official solution uses a `while` loop to iterate through the test cases, whereas my solution uses a `for` loop. Both approaches are valid, but the `for` loop is generally more Pythonic when iterating over a known range or list. Additionally, the official solution uses `list(input().split(' '))` to split the string, which is slightly redundant since `split()` already returns a list. My solution uses `split()` directly, which is more concise.

Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions are efficient given the constraints. The main takeaway is the importance of correctly identifying standalone words in a string, which can be effectively achieved using the `split()` method.

[Problem]
    "I don't have any fancy quotes." - vijju123
    Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
    You are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 50$
    - $1 \le |S| \le 100$
    - each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space
