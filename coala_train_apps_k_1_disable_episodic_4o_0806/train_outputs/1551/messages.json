The core concept was to correctly identify \"not\" as a separate word, which required splitting the quote into words and checking for \"not\" in the resulting list. This approach ensures that \"not\" is not part of another word, such as \"nothing\".\n\nThe solution involved reading multiple quotes, splitting each quote into words using the `split()` method, and checking if \"not\" is present in the list of words.

Additionally, the official solution uses `list(input().split(' '))` to split the string, which is slightly redundant since `split()` already returns a list.
