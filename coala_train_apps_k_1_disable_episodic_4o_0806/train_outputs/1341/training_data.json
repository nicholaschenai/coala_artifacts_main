    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem involves removing a contiguous subsequence from a sequence of integers such that the remaining sequence is strictly increasing. The challenge is to efficiently count the number of valid ways to perform this operation for each test case.\n\n#### Initial Missteps\nInitially, I focused on identifying strictly increasing segments within the sequence and calculating combinations within those segments. This approach was incorrect because it did not account for all possible contiguous subsequences that could be removed to leave a strictly increasing sequence.\n\n#### Correct Approach\nThe correct approach involves using dynamic programming to track the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) ending at each position and the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS) starting at each position. By leveraging these two arrays, we can efficiently calculate the number of ways to remove a contiguous subsequence such that the remaining sequence is strictly increasing.\n\n#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\nOne of the errors was in the logic of counting valid removals. The solution needed to account for the possibility of removing subsequences that span across different segments of the sequence. The fix involved correctly using the LIS and LDS arrays to determine the number of valid removals for each element in the sequence.\n\n#### Final Solution\nThe final solution iterates through the sequence in linear time, using the LIS and LDS arrays to calculate the number of valid ways to remove a contiguous subsequence. This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle large input sizes as specified by the problem constraints.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\nThe problem of finding the number of ways to remove a contiguous subsequence such that the remaining sequence is strictly increasing is more complex than it initially appears. My initial attempts focused on identifying strictly increasing segments and calculating combinations within those segments, which was a misinterpretation of the problem requirements.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Pre and Suf Functions**:\n   - The `pre` function identifies the last position `p` where the sequence is non-increasing from the start. This helps in determining the longest prefix that can be part of a strictly increasing sequence.\n   - The `suf` function identifies the first position `s` from the end where the sequence is non-decreasing. This helps in determining the longest suffix that can be part of a strictly increasing sequence.\n\n2. **Use of Bisect**:\n   - The solution uses the `bisect` module to efficiently find the position in the suffix where elements from the prefix can be inserted to maintain the increasing order. This is a clever use of binary search to optimize the process of finding valid subsequences.\n\n3. **Counting Valid Removals**:\n   - The solution calculates the number of valid subsequences by iterating over the prefix and using the bisect position to determine how many elements can be part of the increasing sequence when combined with the suffix.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**:\n   - The solution also accounts for the case where the entire sequence is already strictly increasing, using a simple arithmetic formula to calculate the number of ways to remove subsequences.\n\n#### Why My Approach Failed:\n\n- My approach did not correctly account for the need to combine elements from different parts of the sequence to form a strictly increasing sequence. It focused too much on local segments rather than the global structure of the sequence.\n- I did not utilize efficient searching techniques like binary search, which are crucial for handling large input sizes within the constraints.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe official solution provides a more comprehensive and efficient approach to solving the problem by leveraging binary search and understanding the sequence's global structure. This experience highlights the importance of considering both local and global properties of sequences and using efficient algorithms to handle large datasets.",
