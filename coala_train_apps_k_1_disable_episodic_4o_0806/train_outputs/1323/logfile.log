## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of their profit/loss values is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of all profits/losses from the start up to station `i`. This allows us to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.

2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we need to find two prefix sums that are closest to each other. The difference between these two prefix sums will give us the sum of the subarray between them.

3. **Sorting for Efficiency**: By sorting the prefix sums, we can efficiently find the two closest sums. The difference between these two sums will be minimized, and we can determine the indices of the subarray by their original positions.

4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, we choose the longest one. This can be naturally handled by checking the length of the subarray when we find two prefix sums with the same difference.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a prefix sum array with the first element as zero.
2. Iterate through the profits/losses and fill the prefix sum array.
3. Pair each prefix sum with its index and sort these pairs.
4. Initialize variables to track the minimum difference and the best indices.
5. Iterate through the sorted prefix sums:
   - Calculate the difference between consecutive prefix sums.
   - If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum and the indices.
   - If the difference is the same but the subarray is longer, update the indices.
6. Output the minimum difference and the indices of the best subarray.

### Python Code

```python
def find_best_segment(N, profits):
    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort
    indexed_prefix_sums = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]
    indexed_prefix_sums.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the best segment
    min_diff = float('inf')
    best_start = 0
    best_end = 0
    
    # Step 4: Find the closest pair of prefix sums
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_diff = abs(indexed_prefix_sums[i][0] - indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][0])
        start_index = min(indexed_prefix_sums[i][1], indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][1])
        end_index = max(indexed_prefix_sums[i][1], indexed_prefix_sums[i - 1][1]) - 1
        
        # Check if we found a better segment
        if current_diff < min_diff or (current_diff == min_diff and (end_index - start_index) > (best_end - best_start)):
            min_diff = current_diff
            best_start = start_index
            best_end = end_index
    
    # Step 5: Output the result
    print(min_diff)
    print(best_start + 1, best_end + 1)

# Example usage:
# N = 8
# profits = [-20, 90, -30, -20, 80, -70, -60, 125]
# find_best_segment(N, profits)
```

This code efficiently finds the segment with the sum closest to zero by leveraging prefix sums and sorting, ensuring it runs in O(N log N) time, which is suitable for the given constraints.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we can use the prefix sum array. The difference between any two prefix sums gives the sum of the subarray between those two indices. We need to find two prefix sums whose difference is closest to zero.

3. **Sorting and Searching**: Sort the prefix sums along with their indices. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray sum closest to zero.

4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, choose the longest one. This can be done by checking the indices of the prefix sums.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a prefix sum array with an initial value of zero.
2. Compute the prefix sums for the given profits/losses.
3. Pair each prefix sum with its index and sort these pairs.
4. Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment.
5. Iterate through the sorted prefix sums:
   - Calculate the difference between consecutive prefix sums.
   - If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.
6. Output the minimum sum and the indices of the longest segment.

### Python Code

```python
def find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits):
    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort
    prefix_with_index = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]
    prefix_with_index.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and longest segment
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    
    # Step 4: Iterate through sorted prefix sums to find the closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < min_abs_sum:
            min_abs_sum = abs(current_diff)
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            end_index = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
        elif abs(current_diff) == min_abs_sum:
            current_start = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            current_end = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
            if current_end - current_start > end_index - start_index:
                start_index = current_start
                end_index = current_end
    
    # Step 5: Output the result
    print(min_abs_sum)
    print(start_index, end_index)

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code provided is logically correct in terms of the algorithm, but it seems there is an issue with how the input is being read and how the output is being printed. The problem statement specifies that the input should be read from standard input and the output should be written to standard output. This means the code should not rely on function calls for input/output but should directly handle these operations.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The input should be read from standard input. This can be done using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then split it into lines.

2. **Output**: The output should be printed directly to standard output using `print()`.

3. **Function Call**: The function should be called after defining it to ensure it executes with the provided input.

### Revised Python Code

```python
def find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits):
    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort
    prefix_with_index = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]
    prefix_with_index.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and longest segment
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    
    # Step 4: Iterate through sorted prefix sums to find the closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < min_abs_sum:
            min_abs_sum = abs(current_diff)
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            end_index = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
        elif abs(current_diff) == min_abs_sum:
            current_start = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            current_end = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
            if current_end - current_start > end_index - start_index:
                start_index = current_start
                end_index = current_end
    
    # Step 5: Output the result
    print(min_abs_sum)
    print(start_index, end_index)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Call the function with parsed input
find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits)
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into lines. This ensures that all input is captured correctly.
- **Function Call**: The function `find_minimum_profit_loss_segment` is called with the parsed input values.
- **Output**: The results are printed directly using `print()`, which is suitable for standard output. 

These changes ensure that the code correctly interacts with the environment's input/output expectations.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code provided is logically correct in terms of the algorithm, but it seems there is an issue with how the input is being read and how the output is being printed. The problem statement specifies that the input should be read from standard input and the output should be written to standard output. This means the code should not rely on function calls for input/output but should directly handle these operations.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The input should be read from standard input. This can be done using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then split it into lines.

2. **Output**: The output should be printed directly to standard output using `print()`.

3. **Function Call**: The function should be called after defining it to ensure it executes with the provided input.

### Revised Python Code

```python
def find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits):
    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort
    prefix_with_index = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]
    prefix_with_index.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and longest segment
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    
    # Step 4: Iterate through sorted prefix sums to find the closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < min_abs_sum:
            min_abs_sum = abs(current_diff)
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            end_index = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
        elif abs(current_diff) == min_abs_sum:
            current_start = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            current_end = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
            if current_end - current_start > end_index - start_index:
                start_index = current_start
                end_index = current_end
    
    # Step 5: Output the result
    print(min_abs_sum)
    print(start_index, end_index)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Call the function with parsed input
find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits)
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into lines. This ensures that all input is captured correctly.
- **Function Call**: The function `find_minimum_profit_loss_segment` is called with the parsed input values.
- **Output**: The results are printed directly using `print()`, which is suitable for standard output. 

These changes ensure that the code correctly interacts with the environment's input/output expectations.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints

-----Sample Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we can use the prefix sum array. The difference between any two prefix sums gives the sum of the subarray between those two indices. We need to find two prefix sums whose difference is closest to zero.

3. **Sorting and Searching**: Sort the prefix sums along with their indices. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray sum closest to zero.

4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, choose the longest one. This can be done by checking the indices of the prefix sums.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a prefix sum array with an initial value of zero.
2. Compute the prefix sums for the given profits/losses.
3. Pair each prefix sum with its index and sort these pairs.
4. Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment.
5. Iterate through the sorted prefix sums:
   - Calculate the difference between consecutive prefix sums.

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into lines. This ensures that all input is captured correctly.
- **Prefix Sums**: We compute prefix sums to efficiently calculate subarray sums.
- **Sorting**: We sort the prefix sums along with their indices to find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums.
- **Finding the Segment**: We iterate through the sorted prefix sums to find the segment with the sum closest to zero, updating the indices if a longer segment with the same sum is found.
- **Output**: The results are printed directly using `print()`, which is suitable for standard output. 

This code should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code is almost correct, but there is a subtle issue with how the minimum absolute sum is being calculated and reported. The problem lies in the fact that the code is currently reporting the absolute value of the sum, rather than the actual sum itself. The expected output requires the actual sum, which can be negative, not just its absolute value.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Correct the Output of the Sum**: Instead of printing the absolute value of the sum, we should print the actual sum itself. This means we need to track the actual difference between the prefix sums, not just its absolute value.

2. **Ensure Correct Indices**: The indices should be correctly adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

### Revised Python Code

```python
def find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits):
    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort
    prefix_with_index = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]
    prefix_with_index.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the minimum sum and longest segment
    min_sum = float('inf')
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    
    # Step 4: Iterate through sorted prefix sums to find the closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < abs(min_sum) or (abs(current_diff) == abs(min_sum) and current_diff < min_sum):
            min_sum = current_diff
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            end_index = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
        elif abs(current_diff) == abs(min_sum):
            current_start = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            current_end = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
            if current_end - current_start > end_index - start_index:
                start_index = current_start
                end_index = current_end
    
    # Step 5: Output the result
    print(min_sum)
    print(start_index, end_index)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
N = int(data[0])
profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Call the function with parsed input
find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits)
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Tracking Actual Sum**: The code now tracks the actual sum (`current_diff`) rather than just its absolute value. This ensures that the correct sum is printed.
- **Comparison Logic**: The logic for updating the minimum sum now considers both the absolute value and the actual value to ensure the correct sum is chosen.
- **Output**: The code prints the actual sum and the indices, which are adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

These changes should ensure that the code produces the correct output for the given problem.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints

-----Sample Input-----

-20

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we can use the prefix sum array. The difference between any two prefix sums gives the sum of the subarray between those two indices. We need to find two prefix sums whose difference is closest to zero.

3. **Sorting and Searching**: Sort the prefix sums along with their indices. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray sum closest to zero.

4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, choose the longest one. This can be done by checking the indices of the prefix sums.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a prefix sum array with an initial value of zero.
2. Compute the prefix sums for the given profits/losses.
3. Pair each prefix sum with its index and sort these pairs.
4. Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment.
5. Iterate through the sorted prefix sums:
   - Calculate the difference between consecutive prefix sums.
   - If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.
6. Output the minimum sum and the indices of the longest segment.

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into lines. This ensures that all input is captured correctly.
- **Prefix Sums**: We compute prefix sums to efficiently calculate subarray sums.
- **Sorting**: We sort the prefix sums along with their indices to find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums.
- **Finding the Segment**: We iterate through the sorted prefix sums to find the segment with the sum closest to zero, updating the indices if a longer segment with the same sum is found.
- **Output**: The results are printed directly using `print()`, which is suitable for standard output. 

This code should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code is almost correct, but there is a subtle issue with how the minimum absolute sum is being calculated and reported. The problem lies in the fact that the code is currently reporting the absolute value of the sum, rather than the actual sum itself. The expected output requires the actual sum, which can be negative, not just its absolute value.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Correct the Output of the Sum**: Instead of printing the absolute value of the sum, we should print the actual sum itself. This means we need to track the actual difference between the prefix sums, not just its absolute value.

2. **Ensure Correct Indices**: The indices should be correctly adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

### Revised Python Code

```python
def find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits):
    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort
    prefix_with_index = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]
    prefix_with_index.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the minimum sum and longest segment
    min_sum = float('inf')
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    
    # Step 4: Iterate through sorted prefix sums to find the closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < abs(min_sum) or (abs(current_diff) == abs(min_sum) and current_diff < min_sum):
            min_sum = current_diff
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            end_index = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
        elif abs(current_diff) == abs(min_sum):
            current_start = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            current_end = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
            if current_end - current_start > end_index - start_index:
                start_index = current_start
                end_index = current_end
    
    # Step 5: Output the result
    print(min_sum)
    print(start_index, end_index)

### Explanation of Changes

- **Tracking Actual Sum**: The code now tracks the actual sum (`current_diff`) rather than just its absolute value. This ensures that the correct sum is printed.
- **Comparison Logic**: The logic for updating the minimum sum now considers both the absolute value and the actual value to ensure the correct sum is chosen.
- **Output**: The code prints the actual sum and the indices, which are adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

These changes should ensure that the code produces the correct output for the given problem.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints

-----Sample Input-----
8
-20
90
-30
-20

-70
-60
125

-----Sample Output-----

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we can use the prefix sum array. The difference between any two prefix sums gives the sum of the subarray between those two indices. We need to find two prefix sums whose difference is closest to zero.

3. **Sorting and Searching**: Sort the prefix sums along with their indices. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray sum closest to zero.

4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, choose the longest one. This can be done by checking the indices of the prefix sums.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a prefix sum array with an initial value of zero.
2. Compute the prefix sums for the given profits/losses.
3. Pair each prefix sum with its index and sort these pairs.
4. Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment.
5. Iterate through the sorted prefix sums:
   - Calculate the difference between consecutive prefix sums.
   - If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.
6. Output the minimum sum and the indices of the longest segment.

### Python Code

```python
def find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits):
    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort
    prefix_with_index = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]
    prefix_with_index.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and longest segment
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    
    # Step 4: Iterate through sorted prefix sums to find the closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < min_abs_sum:
            min_abs_sum = abs(current_diff)
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            end_index = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
        elif abs(current_diff) == min_abs_sum:
            current_start = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            current_end = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
            if current_end - current_start > end_index - start_index:
                start_index = current_start
                end_index = current_end
    
    # Step 5: Output the result
    print(min_abs_sum)
    print(start_index, end_index)

# Example usage:
# N = 8
# profits = [-20, 90, -30, -20, 80, -70, -60, 125]
# find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits)
```

This code efficiently finds the segment with the sum closest to zero using prefix sums and sorting, ensuring it handles large inputs within the constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code provided is logically correct in terms of the algorithm, but it seems there is an issue with how the input is being read and how the output is being printed. The problem statement specifies that the input should be read from standard input and the output should be written to standard output. This means the code should not rely on function calls for input/output but should directly handle these operations.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The input should be read from standard input. This can be done using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then split it into lines.

2. **Output**: The output should be printed directly to standard output using `print()`.

3. **Function Call**: The function should be called after defining it to ensure it executes with the provided input.

- **Function Call**: The function `find_minimum_profit_loss_segment` is called with the parsed input values.
- **Output**: The results are printed directly using `print()`, which is suitable for standard output. 

These changes ensure that the code correctly interacts with the environment's input/output expectations.

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into lines. This ensures that all input is captured correctly.
- **Prefix Sums**: We compute prefix sums to efficiently calculate subarray sums.
- **Sorting**: We sort the prefix sums along with their indices to find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums.
- **Finding the Segment**: We iterate through the sorted prefix sums to find the segment with the sum closest to zero, updating the indices if a longer segment with the same sum is found.
- **Output**: The results are printed directly using `print()`, which is suitable for standard output. 

This code should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code is almost correct, but there is a subtle issue with how the minimum absolute sum is being calculated and reported. The problem lies in the fact that the code is currently reporting the absolute value of the sum, rather than the actual sum itself. The expected output requires the actual sum, which can be negative, not just its absolute value.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Correct the Output of the Sum**: Instead of printing the absolute value of the sum, we should print the actual sum itself. This means we need to track the actual difference between the prefix sums, not just its absolute value.

2. **Ensure Correct Indices**: The indices should be correctly adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

def find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits):

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code is still not producing the expected output because of a misunderstanding in how the minimum sum is being tracked and reported. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum sum and the conditions for updating it. Specifically, the code is not correctly handling the case where the sum is negative, which is why the output is incorrect.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Correct the Logic for Minimum Sum**: The logic should ensure that the actual sum (not just its absolute value) is tracked and reported. The condition for updating the minimum sum should be based on the absolute value, but the actual sum should be stored and printed.

2. **Ensure Correct Indices**: The indices should be correctly adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

### Explanation of Changes

- **Tracking Actual Sum**: The code now correctly tracks the actual sum (`current_diff`) and updates `min_sum` with this value when a new minimum is found.
- **Comparison Logic**: The logic for updating the minimum sum now correctly uses the absolute value for comparison but stores the actual sum for output.
- **Output**: The code prints the actual sum and the indices, which are adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

These changes should ensure that the code produces the correct output for the given problem.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints

-----Sample Input-----
8
-20
90
-30
-20

-70
-60
125

-----Sample Output-----

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we can use the prefix sum array. The difference between any two prefix sums gives the sum of the subarray between those two indices. We need to find two prefix sums whose difference is closest to zero.

3. **Sorting and Searching**: Sort the prefix sums along with their indices. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray sum closest to zero.

4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, choose the longest one. This can be done by checking the indices of the prefix sums.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a prefix sum array with an initial value of zero.
2. Compute the prefix sums for the given profits/losses.
3. Pair each prefix sum with its index and sort these pairs.
4. Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment.
5. Iterate through the sorted prefix sums:
   - Calculate the difference between consecutive prefix sums.
   - If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.
6. Output the minimum sum and the indices of the longest segment.

### Python Code

```python
def find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits):
    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort
    prefix_with_index = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]
    prefix_with_index.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and longest segment
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    
    # Step 4: Iterate through sorted prefix sums to find the closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < min_abs_sum:
            min_abs_sum = abs(current_diff)
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            end_index = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
        elif abs(current_diff) == min_abs_sum:
            current_start = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            current_end = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
            if current_end - current_start > end_index - start_index:
                start_index = current_start
                end_index = current_end
    
    # Step 5: Output the result
    print(min_abs_sum)
    print(start_index, end_index)

# Example usage:
# N = 8
# profits = [-20, 90, -30, -20, 80, -70, -60, 125]

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code provided is logically correct in terms of the algorithm, but it seems there is an issue with how the input is being read and how the output is being printed. The problem statement specifies that the input should be read from standard input and the output should be written to standard output. This means the code should not rely on function calls for input/output but should directly handle these operations.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The input should be read from standard input. This can be done using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then split it into lines.

2. **Output**: The output should be printed directly to standard output using `print()`.

3. **Function Call**: The function should be called after defining it to ensure it executes with the provided input.

        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < min_abs_sum:
            min_abs_sum = abs(current_diff)
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            end_index = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
        elif abs(current_diff) == min_abs_sum:

- **Output**: The results are printed directly using `print()`, which is suitable for standard output. 

These changes ensure that the code correctly interacts with the environment's input/output expectations.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code is almost correct, but there is a subtle issue with how the minimum absolute sum is being calculated and reported. The problem lies in the fact that the code is currently reporting the absolute value of the sum, rather than the actual sum itself. The expected output requires the actual sum, which can be negative, not just its absolute value.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Correct the Output of the Sum**: Instead of printing the absolute value of the sum, we should print the actual sum itself. This means we need to track the actual difference between the prefix sums, not just its absolute value.

2. **Ensure Correct Indices**: The indices should be correctly adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum sum and the conditions for updating it. Specifically, the code is not correctly handling the case where the sum is negative, which is why the output is incorrect.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Correct the Logic for Minimum Sum**: The logic should ensure that the actual sum (not just its absolute value) is tracked and reported. The condition for updating the minimum sum should be based on the absolute value, but the actual sum should be stored and printed.

2. **Ensure Correct Indices**: The indices should be correctly adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

### Revised Python Code

```python
def find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits):
    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort
    prefix_with_index = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]
    prefix_with_index.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the minimum sum and longest segment
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    min_sum = 0
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    
    # Step 4: Iterate through sorted prefix sums to find the closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < min_abs_sum:
            min_abs_sum = abs(current_diff)
            min_sum = current_diff
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            end_index = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
        elif abs(current_diff) == min_abs_sum:
            current_start = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            current_end = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
            if current_end - current_start > end_index - start_index:
                min_sum = current_diff
                start_index = current_start
                end_index = current_end
    
    # Step 5: Output the result
    print(min_sum)
    print(start_index, end_index)

# Read input from standard input

# Parse input

profits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))

# Call the function with parsed input

```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Tracking Actual Sum**: The code now correctly tracks the actual sum (`current_diff`) and updates `min_sum` with this value when a new minimum is found.
- **Comparison Logic**: The logic for updating the minimum sum now correctly uses the absolute value for comparison but stores the actual sum for output.
- **Output**: The code prints the actual sum and the indices, which are adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

These changes should ensure that the code produces the correct output for the given problem.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we can use the prefix sum array. The difference between any two prefix sums gives the sum of the subarray between those two indices. We need to find two prefix sums whose difference is closest to zero.

3. **Sorting and Searching**: Sort the prefix sums along with their indices. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray sum closest to zero.

4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, choose the longest one. This can be done by checking the indices of the prefix sums.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a prefix sum array with an initial value of zero.
2. Compute the prefix sums for the given profits/losses.
3. Pair each prefix sum with its index and sort these pairs.
4. Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment.
5. Iterate through the sorted prefix sums:
   - Calculate the difference between consecutive prefix sums.
   - If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.
6. Output the minimum sum and the indices of the longest segment.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code provided is logically correct in terms of the algorithm, but it seems there is an issue with how the input is being read and how the output is being printed. The problem statement specifies that the input should be read from standard input and the output should be written to standard output. This means the code should not rely on function calls for input/output but should directly handle these operations.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The input should be read from standard input. This can be done using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then split it into lines.

2. **Output**: The output should be printed directly to standard output using `print()`.

3. **Function Call**: The function should be called after defining it to ensure it executes with the provided input.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code is almost correct, but there is a subtle issue with how the minimum absolute sum is being calculated and reported. The problem lies in the fact that the code is currently reporting the absolute value of the sum, rather than the actual sum itself. The expected output requires the actual sum, which can be negative, not just its absolute value.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Correct the Output of the Sum**: Instead of printing the absolute value of the sum, we should print the actual sum itself. This means we need to track the actual difference between the prefix sums, not just its absolute value.

2. **Ensure Correct Indices**: The indices should be correctly adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

### Revised Python Code

    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort

        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < abs(min_sum) or (abs(current_diff) == abs(min_sum) and current_diff < min_sum):
            min_sum = current_diff
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1

### Explanation of Changes

- **Tracking Actual Sum**: The code now tracks the actual sum (`current_diff`) rather than just its absolute value. This ensures that the correct sum is printed.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code is still not producing the expected output because of a misunderstanding in how the minimum sum is being tracked and reported. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum sum and the conditions for updating it. Specifically, the code is not correctly handling the case where the sum is negative, which is why the output is incorrect.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Correct the Logic for Minimum Sum**: The logic should ensure that the actual sum (not just its absolute value) is tracked and reported. The condition for updating the minimum sum should be based on the absolute value, but the actual sum should be stored and printed.

2. **Ensure Correct Indices**: The indices should be correctly adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts

The problem required finding a contiguous subarray of station profits/losses such that the sum is closest to zero, and if there are ties, the longest subarray should be chosen. The core concept here is using prefix sums to efficiently calculate subarray sums and sorting these prefix sums to find the smallest difference, which corresponds to the subarray sum closest to zero.

#### Key Concepts and Patterns:
- **Prefix Sums**: This technique allows for efficient calculation of subarray sums by storing cumulative sums up to each index.
- **Sorting and Pairing**: By sorting the prefix sums along with their indices, we can easily find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which gives the subarray sum closest to zero.

#### Strategies and Errors:
- **Initial Strategy**: The initial approach correctly used prefix sums and sorting but failed to track the actual sum correctly. It mistakenly reported the absolute value of the sum instead of the actual sum.
- **Fixing Errors**: The main error was in the logic for updating and reporting the minimum sum. The solution was to track both the absolute value for comparison and the actual sum for output.

#### Final Solution:
The final solution involved correctly tracking the actual sum (`current_diff`) and updating the minimum sum (`min_sum`) when a new minimum was found. The indices were adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement. This approach ensures that the correct subarray is identified and reported.

This problem reinforced the importance of carefully handling both the absolute and actual values when dealing with sums and differences, especially when the problem constraints involve both positive and negative numbers.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The government of Siruseri has just commissioned one of the longest and most modern railway routes in the world. This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.
The railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.
The Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.
The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!
In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.
For example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:
$ $
Station              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 
Expected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 

$ $
If the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.

-----Output:-----
The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints

-----Sample Input-----
8
-20
90
-30
-20

-70
-60
125

-----Sample Output-----

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a series of railway stations, each with an associated profit or loss value. We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of the profits/losses in this segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start up to `i`.

2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we can use the prefix sum array. The difference between any two prefix sums gives the sum of the subarray between those two indices. We need to find two prefix sums whose difference is closest to zero.

3. **Sorting and Searching**: Sort the prefix sums along with their indices. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums, which corresponds to the subarray sum closest to zero.

4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, choose the longest one. This can be done by checking the indices of the prefix sums.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a prefix sum array with an initial value of zero.
2. Compute the prefix sums for the given profits/losses.
3. Pair each prefix sum with its index and sort these pairs.
4. Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment.
5. Iterate through the sorted prefix sums:
   - Calculate the difference between consecutive prefix sums.
   - If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum and the segment indices.
   - If the difference is the same but the segment is longer, update the segment indices.
6. Output the minimum sum and the indices of the longest segment.

### Python Code

```python
def find_minimum_profit_loss_segment(N, profits):
    # Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Pair prefix sums with their indices and sort
    prefix_with_index = [(prefix_sums[i], i) for i in range(N + 1)]
    prefix_with_index.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum and longest segment
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    start_index = 0
    end_index = 0
    
    # Step 4: Iterate through sorted prefix sums to find the closest to zero
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < min_abs_sum:
            min_abs_sum = abs(current_diff)
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            end_index = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
        elif abs(current_diff) == min_abs_sum:
            current_start = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            current_end = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
            if current_end - current_start > end_index - start_index:
                start_index = current_start
                end_index = current_end
    
    # Step 5: Output the result
    print(min_abs_sum)
    print(start_index, end_index)

# Example usage:
# N = 8
# profits = [-20, 90, -30, -20, 80, -70, -60, 125]

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code provided is logically correct in terms of the algorithm, but it seems there is an issue with how the input is being read and how the output is being printed. The problem statement specifies that the input should be read from standard input and the output should be written to standard output. This means the code should not rely on function calls for input/output but should directly handle these operations.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The input should be read from standard input. This can be done using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then split it into lines.

2. **Output**: The output should be printed directly to standard output using `print()`.

3. **Function Call**: The function should be called after defining it to ensure it executes with the provided input.

        current_diff = prefix_with_index[i][0] - prefix_with_index[i - 1][0]
        if abs(current_diff) < min_abs_sum:
            min_abs_sum = abs(current_diff)
            start_index = min(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1]) + 1
            end_index = max(prefix_with_index[i][1], prefix_with_index[i - 1][1])
        elif abs(current_diff) == min_abs_sum:

- **Function Call**: The function `find_minimum_profit_loss_segment` is called with the parsed input values.
- **Output**: The results are printed directly using `print()`, which is suitable for standard output. 

These changes ensure that the code correctly interacts with the environment's input/output expectations.

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into lines. This ensures that all input is captured correctly.
- **Prefix Sums**: We compute prefix sums to efficiently calculate subarray sums.
- **Sorting**: We sort the prefix sums along with their indices to find the smallest difference between any two prefix sums.
- **Finding the Segment**: We iterate through the sorted prefix sums to find the segment with the sum closest to zero, updating the indices if a longer segment with the same sum is found.
- **Output**: The results are printed directly using `print()`, which is suitable for standard output. 

This code should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code is almost correct, but there is a subtle issue with how the minimum absolute sum is being calculated and reported. The problem lies in the fact that the code is currently reporting the absolute value of the sum, rather than the actual sum itself. The expected output requires the actual sum, which can be negative, not just its absolute value.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Correct the Output of the Sum**: Instead of printing the absolute value of the sum, we should print the actual sum itself. This means we need to track the actual difference between the prefix sums, not just its absolute value.

2. **Ensure Correct Indices**: The indices should be correctly adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1323 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code is still not producing the expected output because of a misunderstanding in how the minimum sum is being tracked and reported. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum sum and the conditions for updating it. Specifically, the code is not correctly handling the case where the sum is negative, which is why the output is incorrect.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Correct the Logic for Minimum Sum**: The logic should ensure that the actual sum (not just its absolute value) is tracked and reported. The condition for updating the minimum sum should be based on the absolute value, but the actual sum should be stored and printed.

2. **Ensure Correct Indices**: The indices should be correctly adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

### Explanation of Changes

- **Tracking Actual Sum**: The code now correctly tracks the actual sum (`current_diff`) and updates `min_sum` with this value when a new minimum is found.
- **Comparison Logic**: The logic for updating the minimum sum now correctly uses the absolute value for comparison but stores the actual sum for output.
- **Output**: The code prints the actual sum and the indices, which are adjusted to be 1-based as required by the problem statement.

These changes should ensure that the code produces the correct output for the given problem.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

The problem of finding the largest contiguous subarray with a sum closest to zero is a classic example of using prefix sums and sorting to efficiently solve a problem that would otherwise require a more computationally expensive approach.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Prefix Sums and Sorting**: The official solution uses a combination of prefix sums and binary search to efficiently find the subarray with the sum closest to zero. This is a common technique for problems involving subarray sums, as it allows for quick calculation of any subarray sum by subtracting two prefix sums.

2. **Binary Search with `bisect`**: The use of the `bisect` module to maintain a sorted list of prefix sums is particularly insightful. This allows the solution to efficiently find the position where the current prefix sum should be inserted, maintaining the sorted order. This is crucial for quickly finding the closest sums.

3. **Handling Indices**: The solution carefully tracks indices to ensure that the longest subarray is chosen when multiple subarrays have the same sum closest to zero. This involves checking the length of the subarray and updating the indices accordingly.

4. **Nonlocal Variables**: The use of nonlocal variables in the helper function `check` is a neat way to update variables that are outside the function's local scope. This is useful for maintaining state across multiple calls to the function.

#### Why My Approach Failed:

- **Absolute Value Mismanagement**: My approach incorrectly focused on the absolute value of the sum, which led to incorrect results when the actual sum was negative. The official solution correctly tracks both the absolute value for comparison and the actual sum for output.

- **Index Management**: My solution did not handle the indices as effectively as the official solution, particularly in terms of ensuring the longest subarray was chosen.

- **Efficiency**: The official solution is more efficient due to its use of binary search and careful management of the prefix sums, which allows it to handle the problem's constraints more effectively.

In summary, the official solution provides a more robust and efficient approach to solving the problem by leveraging prefix sums, sorting, and binary search, while also carefully managing indices to ensure the correct subarray is chosen. This experience highlights the importance of understanding and correctly implementing these techniques in similar problems.
