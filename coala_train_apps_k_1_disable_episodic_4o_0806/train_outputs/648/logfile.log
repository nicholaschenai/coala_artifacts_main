## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills, each with a specific height. We need to handle two types of operations on these hills:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start at the given hill index `i`.
   - For each jump, look for the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.
   - If such a hill is found within 100 hills, move to that hill and continue jumping.
   - If no such hill is found, or if the maximum number of jumps `k` is reached, stop and return the current hill index.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of Type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i - 1
            for jump in range(k):
                found_higher_hill = False
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        current_index = j
                        found_higher_hill = True
                        break
                if not found_higher_hill:
                    break
            output current_index + 1
        else if operation is of Type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    results = []
    for operation in operations:
        if operation[0] == 1:
            # Type 1 operation
            i, k = operation[1], operation[2]
            current_index = i - 1
            for _ in range(k):
                found_higher_hill = False
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        current_index = j
                        found_higher_hill = True
                        break
                if not found_higher_hill:
                    break
            results.append(current_index + 1)
        elif operation[0] == 2:
            # Type 2 operation
            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
N = int(data[0])
Q = int(data[1])
heights = list(map(int, data[2:N+2]))
operations = []
index = N + 2
for _ in range(Q):
    op_type = int(data[index])
    if op_type == 1:
        i = int(data[index + 1])
        k = int(data[index + 2])
        operations.append((1, i, k))
        index += 3
    elif op_type == 2:
        L = int(data[index + 1])
        R = int(data[index + 2])
        X = int(data[index + 3])
        operations.append((2, L, R, X))
        index += 4

# Process operations and print results
results = process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the results for Type 1 operations. The logic ensures that the constraints and requirements of the problem are met efficiently.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----

- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000

-----Subtasks-----

- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:

[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills with given heights. We need to perform two types of operations on this sequence:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start at the given hill index `i`.
   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill and within 100 hills.
   - If such a hill is found, move to that hill and continue jumping.
   - If no such hill is found, stop jumping and return the current hill index.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i
            for jump in range(k):
                next_index = find_next_higher_hill(current_index, heights)
                if next_index is None:
                    break
                current_index = next_index
            output current_index
        else if operation is of type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for index from L to R:
                heights[index] += X

function find_next_higher_hill(current_index, heights):
    current_height = heights[current_index]
    for offset in range(1, 101):

        if heights[current_index + offset] > current_height:
            return current_index + offset
    return None
```

This solution reads input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the results for Type 1 operations. The `find_next_higher_hill` function efficiently finds the next higher hill within a distance of 100 hills.

 ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills with given heights. We need to perform two types of operations on this sequence:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start at the given hill index `i`.
   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill and within 100 hills.
   - If such a hill is found, move to that hill and continue jumping.
   - If no such hill is found, stop jumping and return the current hill index.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i
            for jump in range(k):
                next_index = find_next_higher_hill(current_index, heights)
                if next_index is None:
                    break
                current_index = next_index
            output current_index
        else if operation is of type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for index from L to R:
                heights[index] += X

function find_next_higher_hill(current_index, heights):
    current_height = heights[current_index]
    for offset in range(1, 101):
        if current_index + offset >= len(heights):
            break
        if heights[current_index + offset] > current_height:
            return current_index + offset
    return None
```

    results = process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)
    for result in results:

```

This solution reads input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the results for Type 1 operations. The `find_next_higher_hill` function efficiently finds the next higher hill within a distance of 100 hills.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] In this problem, I tackled a sequence of operations on a list of hill heights, focusing on two main types of operations: jumping to higher hills and adjusting hill heights. The core concept was efficiently managing these operations given constraints on the number of hills and operations.

For the Type 1 operation, the challenge was to simulate jumps to the nearest higher hill within a distance of 100 hills. The solution involved iterating over possible hills to the right and checking their heights, which was straightforward but required careful index management to ensure we stayed within bounds.

For the Type 2 operation, the task was to adjust the heights of a range of hills, which was a simple range update operation. The main consideration here was ensuring that the updates were applied correctly and efficiently.

The solution was implemented using a helper function to find the next higher hill, and a main function to process all operations. The use of 0-based indexing internally, while converting to and from 1-based indexing for input and output, was a key detail to manage correctly.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of efficient iteration and careful index management in handling large datasets, as well as the utility of helper functions to encapsulate specific tasks.

The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills with given heights. We need to perform two types of operations on this sequence:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start at the given hill index `i`.
   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill and within 100 hills.
   - If such a hill is found, move to that hill and continue jumping.
   - If no such hill is found, stop jumping and return the current hill index.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i
            for jump in range(k):
                next_index = find_next_higher_hill(current_index, heights)
                if next_index is None:
                    break
                current_index = next_index
            output current_index
        else if operation is of type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for index from L to R:
                heights[index] += X

function find_next_higher_hill(current_index, heights):
    current_height = heights[current_index]
    for offset in range(1, 101):
        if current_index + offset >= len(heights):
            break
        if heights[current_index + offset] > current_height:
            return current_index + offset
    return None
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_next_higher_hill(current_index, heights):
    current_height = heights[current_index]
    for offset in range(1, 101):
        if current_index + offset >= len(heights):
            break
        if heights[current_index + offset] > current_height:
            return current_index + offset
    return None

def process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    results = []
    for operation in operations:
        if operation[0] == 1:
            # Type 1 operation

                    break
                current_index = next_index
            results.append(current_index + 1)  # Convert back to 1-based index
        elif operation[0] == 2:
            # Type 2 operation
            L, R, X = operation[1] - 1, operation[2] - 1, operation[3]  # Convert to 0-based index
            for index in range(L, R + 1):
                heights[index] += X
    return results

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    Q = int(data[1])
    heights = list(map(int, data[2:N+2]))
    operations = []
    index = N + 2
    for _ in range(Q):
        op_type = int(data[index])
        if op_type == 1:
            i = int(data[index + 1])
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            operations.append((op_type, i, k))
            index += 3
        elif op_type == 2:
            L = int(data[index + 1])
            R = int(data[index + 2])
            X = int(data[index + 3])
            operations.append((op_type, L, R, X))
            index += 4
    
    results = process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

main()
```

This solution reads input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the results for Type 1 operations. The `find_next_higher_hill` function efficiently finds the next higher hill within a distance of 100 hills.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the hill jumping competition, the approach I took was quite similar to the official solution, and both passed the test cases successfully. However, there are a few insights and differences worth noting:

1. **Efficiency in Jump Calculation**: Both solutions use a loop to find the next higher hill within a range of 100 hills. The official solution uses a `while` loop with a `temp` flag to break out once a valid jump is found, which is a slightly different approach than my `for` loop with a `break` statement. Both methods are effective, but the `temp` flag is a clear way to indicate when a jump has been made.

2. **Handling of Indices**: Both solutions correctly handle the conversion between 0-based and 1-based indices, which is crucial for correctly interpreting the input and output as per the problem statement.

3. **Type 2 Operation**: The official solution directly modifies the heights in the specified range, similar to my approach. This operation is straightforward and doesn't require optimization beyond iterating over the specified range.

4. **Output Collection**: The official solution collects results in a list and prints them at the end, which is a good practice for handling multiple outputs efficiently.

Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively addressed the requirements. The key takeaway is the importance of handling index conversions carefully and ensuring that loops are efficiently structured to handle constraints like the 100-hill limit.

[Problem]
    Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
    Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
    Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
    Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
    Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

    -----Input-----
    - First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
    - Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
    - Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

    -----Output-----
    For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
    - 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
    - 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
    - -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
    - 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

    -----Subtasks-----
    - Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
    - Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    5 3
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 1 2
    2 3 4 -1
    1 1 2

    Output:
    3
    4

    -----Explanation-----
    The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
    The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
    The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.
