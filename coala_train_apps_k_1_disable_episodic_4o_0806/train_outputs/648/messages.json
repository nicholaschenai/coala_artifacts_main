In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.\nJudges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.\nPlease help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:\nType 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).\nType 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).\n\n-----Input-----\n- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.\n- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.\n- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 100,000\n- 1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 1,000,000\n- 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N\n- -1,000,000 \u2264 X \u2264 1,000,000\n- 1 \u2264 i, k \u2264 N\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 1,000 \n- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n5 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 1 2\n2 3 4 -1\n1 1 2\n\nOutput:\n3\n4\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.\nThe second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).\nThe last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The core concept was efficiently managing these operations given constraints on the number of hills and operations.\n\nFor the Type 1 operation, the challenge was to simulate jumps to the nearest higher hill within a distance of 100 hills. The solution involved iterating over possible hills to the right and checking their heights, which was straightforward but required careful index management to ensure we stayed within bounds.\n\nFor the Type 2 operation, the task was to adjust the heights of a range of hills, which was a simple range update operation. The main consideration here was ensuring that the updates were applied correctly and efficiently.\n\nThe solution was implemented using a helper function to find the next higher hill, and a main function to process all operations. The use of 0-based indexing internally, while converting to and from 1-based indexing for input and output, was a key detail to manage correctly.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of efficient iteration and careful index management in handling large datasets, as well as the utility of helper functions to encapsulate specific tasks."

However, there are a few insights and differences worth noting:\n\n1. **Efficiency in Jump Calculation**: Both solutions use a loop to find the next higher hill within a range of 100 hills. The official solution uses a `while` loop with a `temp` flag to break out once a valid jump is found, which is a slightly different approach than my `for` loop with a `break` statement. Both methods are effective, but the `temp` flag is a clear way to indicate when a jump has been made.\n\n2. **Handling of Indices**: Both solutions correctly handle the conversion between 0-based and 1-based indices, which is crucial for correctly interpreting the input and output as per the problem statement.\n\n3. **Type 2 Operation**: The official solution directly modifies the heights in the specified range, similar to my approach. This operation is straightforward and doesn't require optimization beyond iterating over the specified range.\n\n4. **Output Collection**: The official solution collects results in a list and prints them at the end, which is a good practice for handling multiple outputs efficiently.\n\nOverall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively addressed the requirements. The key takeaway is the importance of handling index conversions carefully and ensuring that loops are efficiently structured to handle constraints like the 100-hill limit."
