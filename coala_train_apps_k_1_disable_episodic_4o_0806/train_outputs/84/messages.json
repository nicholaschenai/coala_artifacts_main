You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. \n\nIf after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.\n\nThere are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; \n\nLet's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \\textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. \n\nYou are given an array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.\n\nNote, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThe first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of array $a$.\n\nThe second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 the elements.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print one integer in single line \u2014 the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n5\n2 1 1 2 2\n6\n1 2 1 1 3 2\n9\n3 1 2 2 1 6 6 3 3\n\nOutput\n4\n1\n8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first query there are four stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \\ldots 4} = [2, 1, 1, 2], a_{2 \\ldots 3} = [1, 1], a_{2 \\ldots 5} = [1, 1, 2, 2], a_{4 \\ldots 5} = [2, 2]$.\n\nIn the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarray\u00a0\u2014 $a_{3 \\ldots 4}$.\n\nIn the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \\ldots 8}, a_{2 \\ldots 5}, a_{2 \\ldots 7}, a_{2 \\ldots 9}, a_{3 \\ldots 4}, a_{6 \\ldots 7}, a_{6 \\ldots 9}, a_{8 \\ldots 9}$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The key strategy was to use a prefix sum array, which allows for constant-time computation of any subarray sum. This approach is crucial when dealing with large input sizes, as it reduces the time complexity from O(N) per query to O(1).\n\n    Initially, the solution failed because the function containing the logic was not called, leading to no output. This was a simple oversight but highlighted the importance of ensuring that all functions are executed, especially when dealing with input/output in competitive programming environments.\n\n    The solution involved reading all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and then processing it. This method is efficient for handling large inputs typical in competitive programming. The prefix sum array was constructed by iterating over the bills, and each query was processed using this array to quickly compute the required sums.\n\n    The experience reinforced the importance of:\n    - Using prefix sums for efficient range queries.\n    - Ensuring that functions are called to execute the intended logic.\n    - Handling input and output correctly in a competitive programming context. \n\n    This problem was a good exercise in optimizing array operations and managing input/output effectively.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "The problem of determining stack exterminable subarrays was insightful in terms of understanding how to efficiently manage and track subarray properties using data structures. Here's a reflection on the approach and insights gained:\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Trie Data Structure for Stack Simulation**:\n   - The official solution uses a trie-like structure to simulate the stack operations. Each node in the trie represents a state of the stack, and transitions between nodes represent pushing or popping elements.\n   - This approach efficiently tracks the number of times a particular stack configuration is reached, which is crucial for counting stack exterminable subarrays.\n\n2. **Efficient Counting with Combinatorics**:\n   - The solution uses combinatorial counting to efficiently calculate the number of exterminable subarrays. By maintaining a count of how many times each stack configuration is reached, it uses combinatorial formulas to determine how many subarrays end at each position.\n   - This avoids the need to explicitly check every possible subarray, significantly reducing the time complexity.\n\n3. **Space and Time Complexity**:\n   - The use of a trie allows the solution to handle large inputs efficiently, adhering to the constraints where the sum of all array lengths across queries is up to 300,000.\n   - The solution is more optimal than a naive approach that checks each subarray individually, which would be infeasible for large inputs.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach\n\n- **Naive Subarray Checking**:\n  - My initial approach involved checking each subarray individually, which is straightforward but inefficient for large arrays due to its quadratic time complexity.\n  - While it worked for small test cases, it would not scale well for the problem's constraints.\n\n- **Learning from the Official Solution**:\n  - The use of a trie to simulate stack operations and track configurations was a novel insight. It highlights the importance of choosing the right data structure to manage state efficiently.\n  - The combinatorial counting technique is a powerful tool for problems involving counting subarrays or subsequences, especially when direct enumeration is too costly.\n\nIn summary, the official solution provided a more efficient and scalable approach to the problem by leveraging advanced data structures and combinatorial mathematics. This experience underscores the importance of exploring different data structures and mathematical techniques to optimize problem-solving strategies."
