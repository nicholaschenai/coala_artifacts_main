## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the length of array $a$.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)Â â€” the elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer in single line â€” the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.


-----Example-----
Input
3
5
2 1 1 2 2
6
1 2 1 1 3 2
9
3 1 2 2 1 6 6 3 3

Output
4
1
8



-----Note-----

In the first query there are four stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 4} = [2, 1, 1, 2], a_{2 \ldots 3} = [1, 1], a_{2 \ldots 5} = [1, 1, 2, 2], a_{4 \ldots 5} = [2, 2]$.

In the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarrayÂ â€” $a_{3 \ldots 4}$.

In the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 8}, a_{2 \ldots 5}, a_{2 \ldots 7}, a_{2 \ldots 9}, a_{3 \ldots 4}, a_{6 \ldots 7}, a_{6 \ldots 9}, a_{8 \ldots 9}$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given multiple queries, each with an array of integers. For each query, we need to determine how many subarrays of the given array are "stack exterminable." A subarray is stack exterminable if, when processed through a specific stack operation, the stack ends up empty. The stack operation involves pushing elements onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case the top element is popped instead.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Stack Extermination**: 
   - We need to simulate a stack where we push elements unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case we pop the stack.
   - A subarray is stack exterminable if, after processing all its elements, the stack is empty.

2. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - For each query, consider all possible subarrays of the given array.
   - For each subarray, simulate the stack operation to check if it is stack exterminable.
   - Count the number of stack exterminable subarrays.

3. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - The brute force approach involves checking all subarrays, which can be computationally expensive.
   - We need to ensure that the solution is efficient enough to handle the constraints, especially since the sum of all array lengths across queries can be large.

## Pseudocode

```
function is_stack_exterminable(subarray):
    initialize an empty stack
    for each element in subarray:
        if stack is not empty and stack top is equal to element:
            pop the stack
        else:
            push element onto the stack
    return true if stack is empty, else false

function count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(array):
    initialize count to 0
    for start in range(0, length of array):
        for end in range(start, length of array):
            subarray = array[start:end+1]
            if is_stack_exterminable(subarray):
                increment count
    return count

function process_queries(queries):
    for each query in queries:
        read n and array
        result = count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(array)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_stack_exterminable(subarray):
    stack = []
    for element in subarray:
        if stack and stack[-1] == element:
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(element)
    return len(stack) == 0

    count = 0

            if is_stack_exterminable(subarray):
                count += 1
    return count

### Explanation of the Code

- **`is_stack_exterminable`**: This function simulates the stack operation for a given subarray and checks if the stack is empty at the end.
- **`count_stack_exterminable_subarrays`**: This function iterates over all possible subarrays of the given array, uses `is_stack_exterminable` to check each one, and counts how many are stack exterminable.
- **`process_queries`**: This function processes each query, applies the counting function, and stores the results.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, parsed, and processed to extract the number of queries and the arrays for each query. The results are then printed.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the length of array $a$.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)Â â€” the elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer in single line â€” the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.


-----Example-----
Input
3

Output

-----Note-----

In the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarrayÂ â€” $a_{3 \ldots 4}$.

In the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 8}, a_{2 \ldots 5}, a_{2 \ldots 7}, a_{2 \ldots 9}, a_{3 \ldots 4}, a_{6 \ldots 7}, a_{6 \ldots 9}, a_{8 \ldots 9}$.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was efficiently calculating the sum of subarrays for multiple queries. The key strategy was to use a prefix sum array, which allows for constant-time computation of any subarray sum. This approach is crucial when dealing with large input sizes, as it reduces the time complexity from O(N) per query to O(1).

    Initially, the solution failed because the function containing the logic was not called, leading to no output. This was a simple oversight but highlighted the importance of ensuring that all functions are executed, especially when dealing with input/output in competitive programming environments.

    The solution involved reading all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and then processing it. This method is efficient for handling large inputs typical in competitive programming. The prefix sum array was constructed by iterating over the bills, and each query was processed using this array to quickly compute the required sums.

    The experience reinforced the importance of:
    - Using prefix sums for efficient range queries.
    - Ensuring that functions are called to execute the intended logic.
    - Handling input and output correctly in a competitive programming context. 

    This problem was a good exercise in optimizing array operations and managing input/output effectively.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the length of array $a$.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)Â â€” the elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer in single line â€” the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.


-----Example-----
Input
3
5
2 1 1 2 2
6
1 2 1 1 3 2
9
3 1 2 2 1 6 6 3 3

Output
4
1
8



-----Note-----

In the first query there are four stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 4} = [2, 1, 1, 2], a_{2 \ldots 3} = [1, 1], a_{2 \ldots 5} = [1, 1, 2, 2], a_{4 \ldots 5} = [2, 2]$.

In the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarrayÂ â€” $a_{3 \ldots 4}$.

In the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 8}, a_{2 \ldots 5}, a_{2 \ldots 7}, a_{2 \ldots 9}, a_{3 \ldots 4}, a_{6 \ldots 7}, a_{6 \ldots 9}, a_{8 \ldots 9}$.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given multiple queries, each consisting of an array. For each query, we need to determine how many subarrays of the given array are "stack exterminable." A subarray is stack exterminable if, when processed through a specific stack operation, the stack ends up empty. The stack operation involves pushing elements onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case the top element is popped.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Stack Operation**: For each element in the array, if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not equal to the current element, push the element onto the stack. If the top of the stack is equal to the current element, pop the stack.

2. **Determine Stack Exterminability**: A subarray is stack exterminable if, after processing all its elements through the stack operation, the stack is empty.

3. **Iterate Over Subarrays**: For each query, iterate over all possible subarrays of the array. For each subarray, simulate the stack operation to check if it is stack exterminable.

4. **Count Stack Exterminable Subarrays**: Count and return the number of stack exterminable subarrays for each query.

## Pseudocode

```
function is_stack_exterminable(subarray):
    initialize an empty stack
    for each element in subarray:
        if stack is not empty and stack top is equal to element:
            pop the stack
        else:
            push element onto the stack
    return true if stack is empty, else false

function count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(array):
    initialize count to 0
    for start in range(0, length of array):
        for end in range(start, length of array):
            subarray = array[start:end+1]
            if is_stack_exterminable(subarray):
                increment count
    return count

function process_queries(queries):
    for each query in queries:
        read n and array
        result = count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(array)
        print result
```

INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] This problem involved determining the number of "stack exterminable" subarrays for multiple queries. The core concept was simulating a stack operation where elements are pushed unless the top of the stack matches the current element, in which case the top is popped. A subarray is stack exterminable if the stack is empty after processing all its elements.

The main challenge was efficiently iterating over all possible subarrays and checking their exterminability. The solution involved a nested loop to generate subarrays and a helper function to simulate the stack operation. This approach worked well for the given constraints, as the sum of all elements across queries was limited.

Key takeaways include understanding how to simulate stack operations and efficiently handle multiple queries. The problem reinforced the importance of breaking down complex operations into manageable functions and iterating over subarrays in a structured manner. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] The problem of determining stack exterminable subarrays was insightful in terms of understanding how to efficiently manage and track subarray properties using data structures. Here's a reflection on the approach and insights gained:

### Key Insights from the Official Solution

1. **Trie Data Structure for Stack Simulation**:
   - The official solution uses a trie-like structure to simulate the stack operations. Each node in the trie represents a state of the stack, and transitions between nodes represent pushing or popping elements.
   - This approach efficiently tracks the number of times a particular stack configuration is reached, which is crucial for counting stack exterminable subarrays.

2. **Efficient Counting with Combinatorics**:
   - The solution uses combinatorial counting to efficiently calculate the number of exterminable subarrays. By maintaining a count of how many times each stack configuration is reached, it uses combinatorial formulas to determine how many subarrays end at each position.
   - This avoids the need to explicitly check every possible subarray, significantly reducing the time complexity.

3. **Space and Time Complexity**:
   - The use of a trie allows the solution to handle large inputs efficiently, adhering to the constraints where the sum of all array lengths across queries is up to 300,000.
   - The solution is more optimal than a naive approach that checks each subarray individually, which would be infeasible for large inputs.

### Reflection on My Approach

- **Naive Subarray Checking**:
  - My initial approach involved checking each subarray individually, which is straightforward but inefficient for large arrays due to its quadratic time complexity.
  - While it worked for small test cases, it would not scale well for the problem's constraints.

- **Learning from the Official Solution**:
  - The use of a trie to simulate stack operations and track configurations was a novel insight. It highlights the importance of choosing the right data structure to manage state efficiently.
  - The combinatorial counting technique is a powerful tool for problems involving counting subarrays or subsequences, especially when direct enumeration is too costly.

The main function is `process_queries`.
INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] The function processes a list of queries, where each query consists of an integer and an array, and calculates the number of subarrays that can be completely reduced by repeatedly removing adjacent pairs of equal elements. It iterates over each query, extracts the array, and uses a helper function to count the subarrays that can be reduced to an empty stack. The results for each query are collected in a list, which is then returned.

[Problem]
    Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

    If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

    There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

    Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

    You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

    Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


    -----Input-----

    The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the number of queries.

    The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the length of array $a$.

    The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)Â â€” the elements.

    It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case print one integer in single line â€” the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.


    -----Example-----
    Input
    3
    5
    2 1 1 2 2
    6
    1 2 1 1 3 2
    9
    3 1 2 2 1 6 6 3 3

    Output
    4
    1
    8



    -----Note-----

    In the first query there are four stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 4} = [2, 1, 1, 2], a_{2 \ldots 3} = [1, 1], a_{2 \ldots 5} = [1, 1, 2, 2], a_{4 \ldots 5} = [2, 2]$.

    In the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarrayÂ â€” $a_{3 \ldots 4}$.

    In the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 8}, a_{2 \ldots 5}, a_{2 \ldots 7}, a_{2 \ldots 9}, a_{3 \ldots 4}, a_{6 \ldots 7}, a_{6 \ldots 9}, a_{8 \ldots 9}$.
