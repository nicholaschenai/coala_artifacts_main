This is efficient for handling large input sizes.\n- **Overlap Consideration**: The new strategy checks for overlaps with the last colored intervals and colors accordingly to maximize the green area.\n- **Efficient Tracking**: By keeping track of the end of the last blue and yellow intervals, we can make informed decisions about the current interval's color. This ensures that overlapping intervals are colored differently, maximizing the green area.\n- **Output Handling**: Results for each test case are collected in a list and printed at the end, ensuring that all outputs are correctly formatted and displayed.",
