Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:\n- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval\n- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.\n- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.\n- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.\nYou want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.\n- The $i^{\\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $ 1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5 $\n- $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $\n- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n- $ 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n3\n3 7\n2 5\n6 9\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n100\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nThe intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:\n- $[2, 3) \\cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.\n- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.\n- $[3, 5] \\cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.\n- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.\nPlease note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.\nNote that 011 is also a valid output.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs when a part of the X-axis is covered by at least one blue interval and at least one yellow interval. We need to determine a coloring strategy for each test case that maximizes the green length.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green color appears where blue and yellow intervals overlap. Therefore, to maximize the green length, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible between blue and yellow intervals.\n\n2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.\n\n3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color the intervals:\n   - Iterate through the sorted intervals.\n   - Maintain a running track of the current end of the blue and yellow intervals.\n   - For each interval, decide whether to color it blue or yellow based on which choice would result in more overlap with the other color.\n\n4. **Decision Making**: \n   - If the current interval starts after the end of the last blue interval, color it yellow.\n   - If the current interval starts after the end of the last yellow interval, color it blue.\n   - If it overlaps with both, choose the color that maximizes the overlap with the other color.\n\n5. **Output**: For each test case, output a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        intervals = test_case.intervals\n        sort intervals by starting point\n        blue_end = -1\n        yellow_end = -1\n        coloring = []\n        for each interval in intervals:\n            if interval.start > blue_end:\n                color it yellow\n                update yellow_end\n            elif interval.start > yellow_end:\n                color it blue\n                update blue_end\n            else:\n                choose color to maximize overlap\n                update respective end\n            append color to coloring\n        append coloring to results\n    return results\n```\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        # Sort intervals by their starting point\n        intervals.sort()\n        \n        # Initialize the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals\n        blue_end = -1\n        yellow_end = -1\n        \n        # This will store the coloring result for the current test case\n        coloring = []\n        \n        for L, R in intervals:\n            if L > blue_end:\n                # If the current interval starts after the last blue interval ends, color it yellow\n                coloring.append('1')\n                yellow_end = max(yellow_end, R)\n            elif L > yellow_end:\n                # If the current interval starts after the last yellow interval ends, color it blue\n                coloring.append('0')\n                blue_end = max(blue_end, R)\n            else:\n                # If it overlaps with both, choose the color that maximizes overlap\n                if blue_end - L < yellow_end - L:\n                    coloring.append('0')\n                    blue_end = max(blue_end, R)\n                else:\n                    coloring.append('1')\n                    yellow_end = max(yellow_end, R)\n        \n        # Append the result for this test case\n        results.append(''.join(coloring))\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nindex = 0\nT = int(data[index])\nindex += 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    intervals = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        L = int(data[index])\n        R = int(data[index + 1])\n        intervals.append((L, R))\n        index += 2\n    test_cases.append(intervals)\n\n# Get results\nresults = maximize_green(T, test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case to determine the optimal coloring strategy, and outputs the result for each test case.

The problem required understanding how water flows from a reservoir until it encounters a taller hill, and how to strategically place reservoirs to minimize their number.\n\n    ### Core Concepts:\n    - **Reservoir Placement**: Water flows from a reservoir until it hits a taller hill. Thus, reservoirs should be placed at strategic points to cover as many hills as possible.\n    - **Two-Pass Strategy**: A left-to-right and right-to-left pass helps identify potential reservoir placements by tracking the highest hill encountered so far.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Strategy**: I attempted to count reservoirs by taking the minimum of the counts from both directions, which was incorrect. This approach failed to account for the fact that each direction might cover different sets of hills.\n    - **Correct Strategy**: The correct approach was to take the maximum of the two counts, ensuring that all hills are covered by considering the optimal coverage from both directions.\n\n    ### Errors and Fixes:\n    - **Misinterpretation of Results**: Initially, I misunderstood the combination of results from both directions, leading to incorrect outputs.\n    - **Correcting the Logic**: By focusing on the maximum of the two directional counts, I ensured that all hills were covered optimally, which resolved the issue.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def minReservoirs(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, heights = case\n\n            # Left to right pass\n            left_to_right_reservoirs = 0\n            max_height_left = 0\n            for i in range(N):\n                if heights[i] > max_height_left:\n                    left_to_right_reservoirs += 1\n                    max_height_left = heights[i]\n\n            # Right to left pass\n            right_to_left_reservoirs = 0\n            max_height_right = 0\n            for i in range(N-1, -1, -1):\n                if heights[i] > max_height_right:\n                    right_to_left_reservoirs += 1\n                    max_height_right = heights[i]\n\n            # The result for this test case is the maximum of the two\n            results.append(max(left_to_right_reservoirs, right_to_left_reservoirs))\n\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem requirements and the need for strategic thinking in algorithm design.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The constraints ensure that a solution is always possible, which is crucial for designing the algorithm.\n\n    2. **Greedy Approach**: Both my initial attempts and the official solution use a greedy approach to fill the boxes. The idea is to always try to fill a box with as many ducks of one color as possible, and then use another color if needed. This approach is effective given the constraints.\n\n    3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes specific handling for the case where `N=2` and `K=5`. This suggests that certain configurations might require special handling to ensure the solution is valid. My initial solution did not account for such specific cases, which could lead to incorrect outputs.\n\n    4. **Index Mapping**: The official solution uses a dictionary to map the original indices of colors after sorting. This ensures that the output reflects the original color indices, which is a detail I overlooked. This mapping is crucial for maintaining the correct output format.\n\n    5. **Iterative Filling**: The official solution iteratively fills each box, checking if the current color can fill the box entirely or if another color is needed. This iterative process ensures that all ducks are distributed correctly across the boxes.\n\n    ### Lessons Learned\n\n    - **Attention to Detail**: Ensuring that the output format matches the expected results is crucial. This includes maintaining the original indices of colors, which can be easily overlooked.\n  \n    - **Special Cases**: Handling special cases explicitly can be necessary, especially when constraints suggest that certain configurations might be problematic.\n\n    - **Greedy Strategy**: A greedy strategy is often effective for distribution problems, but it must be implemented carefully to handle all edge cases and constraints.\n\n    In summary, the official solution provides a robust approach to solving the problem by carefully managing the distribution of ducks and maintaining the correct output format. This experience highlights the importance of considering edge cases and ensuring that all problem constraints are met.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The key challenge is to determine an optimal coloring strategy that maximizes this overlap.\n\n#### Initial Strategy and Mistakes\nInitially, I attempted a simple alternating coloring strategy, which failed because it did not consider the actual overlap between intervals. This approach was too naive and did not account for the specific arrangement and overlap of intervals, leading to suboptimal results.\n\n#### Revised Strategy\nThe revised approach involved sorting the intervals by their starting points and then using a greedy strategy to color them based on their overlap with previously colored intervals. The idea was to alternate colors when intervals overlap to ensure maximum green area. However, this approach also failed because it did not correctly handle the overlap logic.\n\n#### Final Solution\nThe final solution involved a more nuanced understanding of the problem. By sorting the intervals and carefully alternating colors based on their positions and overlaps, I aimed to maximize the green area. However, the solution still did not pass the test cases, indicating a need for further refinement in the overlap logic.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n- **Overlap Consideration**: Simply alternating colors is insufficient; the solution must consider the specific overlaps between intervals.\n- **Greedy Approach**: A greedy approach can be effective but requires careful implementation to ensure it correctly maximizes the desired outcome.\n- **Testing and Debugging**: Thorough testing with various input scenarios is crucial to identify and fix logical errors in the approach.\n\nThis problem highlighted the importance of understanding the underlying logic of interval overlaps and the need for a strategic approach to maximize the desired outcome."

The key insight is to ensure that overlapping intervals are colored differently to maximize the overlap (green area).\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Sorting and Index Tracking**: The official solution sorts the intervals by their starting points and keeps track of the maximum endpoint encountered so far. This allows for efficient decision-making about whether to switch colors or not.\n\n2. **Greedy Coloring Strategy**: The solution uses a greedy approach to decide the color of each interval:\n   - If the current interval starts after the maximum endpoint of previously considered intervals, it can be colored with the current color.\n   - If the current interval ends before or at the maximum endpoint, it should be colored with the opposite color to ensure overlap.\n   - If the current interval overlaps with the maximum endpoint, the color is switched to maximize the green area.\n\n3. **Efficient Use of XOR**: The solution uses the XOR operation (`c ^= 1`) to toggle between colors, which is a neat and efficient way to alternate between two states (0 and 1).\n\n### Why My Approach Failed\n\nMy initial approach failed because it did not adequately consider the overlap between intervals. Simply alternating colors without considering the actual overlap does not guarantee maximum green area. The official solution's use of a greedy strategy based on the maximum endpoint ensures that intervals are colored optimally to maximize overlap.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe official solution provides a more nuanced and effective approach to the problem by leveraging sorting and a greedy strategy based on interval endpoints. This experience highlights the importance of considering the problem constraints and requirements more deeply, especially in greedy algorithm problems where local decisions can significantly impact the global outcome."
