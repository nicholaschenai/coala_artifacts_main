    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Each interval can be colored either blue or yellow. The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs where blue and yellow intervals overlap. We need to determine a coloring strategy for each interval in each test case to achieve this.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green color appears where intervals overlap. To maximize green, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible between blue and yellow intervals.\n\n2. **Sorting Intervals**: By sorting intervals based on their starting points, we can more easily determine where overlaps occur.\n\n3. **Greedy Coloring Strategy**: \n   - Alternate coloring of intervals as we iterate through them. This ensures that adjacent intervals have a high chance of overlapping, thus maximizing the green area.\n   - Start by coloring the first interval blue, the next yellow, and so on.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: If intervals do not overlap, the strategy will still work as it will simply alternate colors without creating green areas.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction maximizeGreen(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        n = number of intervals\n        intervals = list of intervals\n        \n        sort intervals by starting point\n        \n        result = \"\"\n        for i from 0 to n-1:\n            if i is even:\n                result += \"0\"  # Color blue\n            else:\n                result += \"1\"  # Color yellow\n        \n        print result\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef maximizeGreen(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        # Sort intervals by their starting point\n        intervals.sort()\n        \n        # Initialize result string\n        result = []\n        \n        # Alternate coloring\n        for i in range(len(intervals)):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                result.append('0')  # Color blue\n            else:\n                result.append('1')  # Color yellow\n        \n        # Join the result list into a string and store it\n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 1\n# test_cases = [\n#     [(3, 7), (2, 5), (6, 9)]\n# ]\n# maximizeGreen(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Sorting**: We sort the intervals by their starting points to ensure that we process them in a logical order, which helps in maximizing overlaps.\n- **Alternating Colors**: By alternating colors, we ensure that adjacent intervals have a high chance of overlapping, thus maximizing the green area.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n) per test case due to sorting, which is suitable given the constraints.",
