The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

For each integer, we decide whether to include it in the current combination or not. We ensure that each combination consists of unique integers.\n\n3. **Backtracking**: Use backtracking to explore all possible combinations.

If it exceeds \\( N \\), it stops further exploration.\n- **Loop**: The loop iterates over possible integers starting from `start` to ensure uniqueness in combinations.\n- **Main Function**: Reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result using the `countWays` function."

Here are the key insights and differences between my approach and the official solution:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - The official solution uses a dynamic programming array `reach` where `reach[j]` represents the number of ways to sum up to \\( j \\) using unique integers raised to the power \\( K \\).\n   - This approach efficiently builds up solutions for all numbers up to \\( N \\) by iterating over possible base integers and updating the `reach` array.\n\n2. **Efficiency**:\n   - The dynamic programming approach is more efficient than the recursive backtracking approach I initially used. It avoids redundant calculations by storing intermediate results, which is a common advantage of dynamic programming over recursion with backtracking.\n   - The time complexity is reduced because each potential sum is calculated only once, and the results are reused.\n\n3. **Iterative Updates**:\n   - The solution iteratively updates the `reach` array by considering each integer \\( i \\) and its \\( K \\)-th power. It checks if adding this power to existing sums (tracked in `reach`) can form new sums up to \\( N \\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Redundancy**:\n   - By iterating backwards when updating the `reach` array, the solution ensures that each integer is only used once in each combination, thus maintaining the uniqueness constraint.\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThe official solution is a classic example of using dynamic programming to solve combinatorial problems efficiently. It highlights the importance of recognizing when a problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems and leveraging previously computed results to build up to the final solution. This approach is particularly useful in problems involving combinations and partitions, where recursive solutions might be too slow due to redundant calculations."
