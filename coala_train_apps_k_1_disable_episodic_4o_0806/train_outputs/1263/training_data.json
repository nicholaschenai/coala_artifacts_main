    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to find the number of ways to express a given natural number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \\( K \\). The core concept here was to use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers that could sum up to \\( N \\) when raised to the power \\( K \\).\n\nThe strategy involved defining a recursive function `explore` that attempts to build valid combinations by iterating over possible integers starting from a given point to ensure uniqueness. The function checks if the current sum matches \\( N \\) (indicating a valid combination) or exceeds \\( N \\) (indicating an invalid path). This approach effectively explores all potential combinations while ensuring that each combination consists of unique integers.\n\nOne key aspect was handling the base cases correctly: stopping the recursion when the sum equals \\( N \\) or exceeds it. The loop within the recursive function iterates from the current starting integer to \\( N \\), ensuring that each integer is only considered once in each combination, thus maintaining uniqueness.\n\nThe solution was implemented efficiently, and the recursive approach with backtracking proved to be effective for the given constraints. The problem reinforced the utility of recursive backtracking in solving combinatorial problems involving unique combinations.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem of finding the number of ways to express a number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \\( K \\) can be approached using dynamic programming, as demonstrated in the official solution. Here are the key insights and differences between my approach and the official solution:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - The official solution uses a dynamic programming array `reach` where `reach[j]` represents the number of ways to sum up to \\( j \\) using unique integers raised to the power \\( K \\).\n   - This approach efficiently builds up solutions for all numbers up to \\( N \\) by iterating over possible base integers and updating the `reach` array.\n\n2. **Efficiency**:\n   - The dynamic programming approach is more efficient than the recursive backtracking approach I initially used. It avoids redundant calculations by storing intermediate results, which is a common advantage of dynamic programming over recursion with backtracking.\n   - The time complexity is reduced because each potential sum is calculated only once, and the results are reused.\n\n3. **Iterative Updates**:\n   - The solution iteratively updates the `reach` array by considering each integer \\( i \\) and its \\( K \\)-th power. It checks if adding this power to existing sums (tracked in `reach`) can form new sums up to \\( N \\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Redundancy**:\n   - By iterating backwards when updating the `reach` array, the solution ensures that each integer is only used once in each combination, thus maintaining the uniqueness constraint.\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThe official solution is a classic example of using dynamic programming to solve combinatorial problems efficiently. It highlights the importance of recognizing when a problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems and leveraging previously computed results to build up to the final solution. This approach is particularly useful in problems involving combinations and partitions, where recursive solutions might be too slow due to redundant calculations.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers, N and K. It calculates the number of ways to express N as a sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of K. The results for each test case are collected in a list and then written to standard output, each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the number of ways a number can be expressed as a sum of unique powers of integers. This is particularly relevant in combinatorial mathematics and number theory, where such problems often arise. It can also be applied in algorithm design, especially in dynamic programming and recursive problem-solving, where understanding how to break down a problem into smaller subproblems is crucial. Additionally, this knowledge can be useful in competitive programming and coding interviews, where similar problems are frequently encountered."
