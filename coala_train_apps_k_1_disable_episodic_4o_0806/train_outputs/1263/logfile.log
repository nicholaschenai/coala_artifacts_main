INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of the \( K \)-th powers of unique positive integers. We are given multiple test cases, each with its own \( N \) and \( K \).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find combinations of unique positive integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

2. **Approach**:
   - Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers.
   - For each integer starting from 1, calculate its \( K \)-th power and check if it can be part of the sum.
   - If adding this power to the current sum does not exceed \( N \), recursively attempt to find the rest of the sum using the next integers.
   - Ensure that each combination uses unique integers by always considering integers greater than the last used integer.
   - Count each valid combination that sums exactly to \( N \).

3. **Constraints Handling**:
   - The maximum value for \( N \) is 1000, and \( K \) can be up to 6, so the powers can be large, but the number of integers to consider is limited by the fact that their powers should not exceed \( N \).

### Pseudocode

```
function countWays(N, K):
    define recursive function findWays(current_sum, start):
        if current_sum == N:
            increment the count of valid ways
            return
        for each integer i starting from 'start':
            calculate power = i^K
            if current_sum + power > N:
                break the loop
            recursively call findWays(current_sum + power, i + 1)

    initialize count to 0
    call findWays(0, 1)
    return count

read T
for each test case:
    read N, K
    print countWays(N, K)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def countWays(N, K):
    def findWays(current_sum, start):
        nonlocal count
        if current_sum == N:
            count += 1
            return
        for i in range(start, N + 1):
            power = i ** K
            if current_sum + power > N:
                break
            findWays(current_sum + power, i + 1)

    count = 0
    findWays(0, 1)
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(countWays(N, K))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum to \( N \). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed sequentially.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). Each test case provides values for \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to output the number of unique ways for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find combinations of unique integers such that their \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

2. **Recursive Approach**: We can use a recursive function to explore all possible combinations of integers. For each integer, we decide whether to include it in the current combination or not. We ensure that each combination consists of unique integers.

3. **Backtracking**: Use backtracking to explore all possible combinations. Start with the smallest integer and try to build up to \( N \) using its \( K \)-th power. If a combination exceeds \( N \), backtrack and try the next possibility.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If the sum of the current combination equals \( N \), count it as a valid way.
   - If the sum exceeds \( N \), stop exploring that path.

5. **Optimization**: Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

### Pseudocode

```
function countWays(N, K):
    define a recursive function explore(current_sum, start):
        if current_sum == N:
            return 1
        if current_sum > N:
            return 0
        ways = 0
        for i from start to N:
            power = i^K
            if current_sum + power <= N:
                ways += explore(current_sum + power, i + 1)
        return ways

    return explore(0, 1)

read T
for each test case:
    read N, K
    print countWays(N, K)
```

### Python Code

def countWays(N, K):
    def explore(current_sum, start):
        if current_sum == N:

        for i in range(start, N + 1):
            power = i ** K
            if current_sum + power <= N:
                ways += explore(current_sum + power, i + 1)
        return ways

### Explanation

- **Recursive Function**: `explore` is a recursive function that attempts to build combinations of integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum to \( N \).
- **Base Cases**: If the current sum equals \( N \), it counts as a valid combination. If it exceeds \( N \), it stops further exploration.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates over possible integers starting from `start` to ensure uniqueness in combinations.
- **Main Function**: Reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result using the `countWays` function.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). Each test case provides values for \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to output the number of unique ways for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find combinations of unique integers such that their \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

2. **Recursive Approach**: We can use a recursive function to explore all possible combinations of integers. For each integer, we decide whether to include it in the current combination or not. We ensure that each combination consists of unique integers.

3. **Backtracking**: Use backtracking to explore all possible combinations. Start with the smallest integer and try to build up to \( N \) using its \( K \)-th power. If a combination exceeds \( N \), backtrack and try the next possibility.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If the sum of the current combination equals \( N \), count it as a valid way.
   - If the sum exceeds \( N \), stop exploring that path.

5. **Optimization**: Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

### Pseudocode

```
function countWays(N, K):
    define a recursive function explore(current_sum, start):
        if current_sum == N:
            return 1
        if current_sum > N:
            return 0
        ways = 0
        for i from start to N:
            power = i^K
            if current_sum + power <= N:
                ways += explore(current_sum + power, i + 1)
        return ways

    return explore(0, 1)

read T
for each test case:
    read N, K
    print countWays(N, K)
```

### Python Code

```python
def countWays(N, K):
    def explore(current_sum, start):
        if current_sum == N:
            return 1
        if current_sum > N:
            return 0
        ways = 0

            power = i ** K
            if current_sum + power <= N:
                ways += explore(current_sum + power, i + 1)
        return ways

    return explore(0, 1)

### Explanation

- **Recursive Function**: `explore` is a recursive function that attempts to build combinations of integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum to \( N \).
- **Base Cases**: If the current sum equals \( N \), it counts as a valid combination. If it exceeds \( N \), it stops further exploration.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates over possible integers starting from `start` to ensure uniqueness in combinations.
- **Main Function**: Reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result using the `countWays` function.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). The core concept here was to use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers that could sum up to \( N \) when raised to the power \( K \).

The strategy involved defining a recursive function `explore` that attempts to build valid combinations by iterating over possible integers starting from a given point to ensure uniqueness. The function checks if the current sum matches \( N \) (indicating a valid combination) or exceeds \( N \) (indicating an invalid path). This approach effectively explores all potential combinations while ensuring that each combination consists of unique integers.

One key aspect was handling the base cases correctly: stopping the recursion when the sum equals \( N \) or exceeds it. The loop within the recursive function iterates from the current starting integer to \( N \), ensuring that each integer is only considered once in each combination, thus maintaining uniqueness.

The solution was implemented efficiently, and the recursive approach with backtracking proved to be effective for the given constraints. The problem reinforced the utility of recursive backtracking in solving combinatorial problems involving unique combinations.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem of finding the number of ways to express a number \( N \) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \( K \) can be approached using dynamic programming, as demonstrated in the official solution. Here are the key insights and differences between my approach and the official solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The official solution uses a dynamic programming array `reach` where `reach[j]` represents the number of ways to sum up to \( j \) using unique integers raised to the power \( K \).
   - This approach efficiently builds up solutions for all numbers up to \( N \) by iterating over possible base integers and updating the `reach` array.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - The dynamic programming approach is more efficient than the recursive backtracking approach I initially used. It avoids redundant calculations by storing intermediate results, which is a common advantage of dynamic programming over recursion with backtracking.
   - The time complexity is reduced because each potential sum is calculated only once, and the results are reused.

3. **Iterative Updates**:
   - The solution iteratively updates the `reach` array by considering each integer \( i \) and its \( K \)-th power. It checks if adding this power to existing sums (tracked in `reach`) can form new sums up to \( N \).

4. **Avoiding Redundancy**:
   - By iterating backwards when updating the `reach` array, the solution ensures that each integer is only used once in each combination, thus maintaining the uniqueness constraint.

### Key Takeaway

The official solution is a classic example of using dynamic programming to solve combinatorial problems efficiently. It highlights the importance of recognizing when a problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems and leveraging previously computed results to build up to the final solution. This approach is particularly useful in problems involving combinations and partitions, where recursive solutions might be too slow due to redundant calculations.
