    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nYou are given a positive integer `n`. You can perform the following operations to transform `n` into `1`:\n\n1. If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.\n2. If `n` is odd, you can replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.\n\nThe task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the number of operations to transform `n` into `1`. The strategy involves:\n\n1. **Even Numbers**: If `n` is even, the optimal move is to divide it by 2, as this reduces the number significantly in one step.\n2. **Odd Numbers**: If `n` is odd, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice depends on the resulting number:\n   - If `n + 1` is divisible by 4, incrementing might be better because it allows for a subsequent division by 2.\n   - If `n - 1` is divisible by 4, decrementing might be better for the same reason.\n   - Special case: If `n` is 3, decrementing to 2 is optimal because it directly leads to 1 in two steps.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction integerReplacement(n):\n    steps = 0\n    while n is not 1:\n        if n is even:\n            n = n / 2\n        else:\n            if n is 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                n = n - 1\n            else:\n                n = n + 1\n        steps = steps + 1\n    return steps\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n        steps = 0\n        while n != 1:\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                # If n is even, divide by 2\n                n //= 2\n            else:\n                # If n is odd, decide whether to increment or decrement\n                if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                    n -= 1\n                else:\n                    n += 1\n            steps += 1\n        return steps\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We initialize a counter `steps` to track the number of operations.\n- We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.\n- If `n` is even, we divide it by 2.\n- If `n` is odd, we check if decrementing or incrementing is more beneficial:\n  - If `n` is 3 or `(n - 1) % 4 == 0`, we decrement `n`.\n  - Otherwise, we increment `n`.\n- We increment the `steps` counter after each operation.\n- Finally, we return the total number of steps taken to reduce `n` to `1`.",
