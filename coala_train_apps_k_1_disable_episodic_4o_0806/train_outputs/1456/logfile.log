INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to solve a problem involving XOR pair representation (XPR) of a number \( N \). For a given number \( N \), we need to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) such that:
- \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \)
- \( A \oplus B = N \)
- \( A \) is the smallest possible value that satisfies the above conditions.

If no such pair exists, \( A = B = -1 \). Otherwise, the function \( F(N) \) returns the value of \( B \) in the XPR of \( N \).

Given two integers \( L \) and \( R \), we need to compute the sum \( G(L, R) = \sum_{i=L}^R F(i) \).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR Properties**: 
   - XOR operation has a property that \( A \oplus A = 0 \) and \( A \oplus 0 = A \).
   - For \( A \oplus B = N \), we can derive \( B = A \oplus N \).

2. **Finding Valid Pairs**:
   - For each \( N \), iterate over possible values of \( A \) from 1 to \( N \).
   - Calculate \( B = A \oplus N \).
   - Check if \( A \leq B \leq N \). If true, this is a valid pair.

3. **Compute \( F(N) \)**:
   - For each \( N \), find the smallest \( A \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \) and \( 1 \leq A \leq B \leq N \).
   - If no such \( A \) exists, \( F(N) = -1 \).

4. **Compute \( G(L, R) \)**:
   - For each test case, compute the sum of \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

## Pseudocode

```
function F(N):
    for A from 1 to N:
        B = A XOR N
        if A <= B <= N:
            return B
    return -1

function G(L, R):
    sum = 0
    for i from L to R:
        sum += F(i)
    return sum

read T
for each test case:
    read L, R
    print G(L, R)
```

## Python Solution

```python
def F(N):
    # Iterate over possible values of A
    for A in range(1, N + 1):
        B = A ^ N  # Calculate B using XOR
        # Check if the pair (A, B) is valid
        if A <= B <= N:
            return B
    return -1  # If no valid pair is found

def G(L, R):
    total_sum = 0
    # Calculate the sum of F(i) for all i from L to R
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        total_sum += F(i)
    return total_sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(G(L, R))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# The main function will be called when the script is executed
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result for each one. The function `F(N)` finds the value of \( B \) for each \( N \), and `G(L, R)` computes the sum of these values over the range \([L, R]\).

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

We need to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) for a given positive integer \( N \) such that:
- \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \)
- \( A \oplus B = N \)
- \( A \) is the smallest possible value that satisfies the above conditions.

If no such pair exists, \( A = B = -1 \). The function \( F(N) \) returns the value of \( B \) in this pair. We then define another function \( G(L, R) \) which is the sum of \( F(i) \) for all integers \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

Given multiple test cases, each with a range \( [L, R] \), we need to compute \( G(L, R) \) for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR Pair Representation (XPR):**
   - For a given \( N \), find the smallest \( A \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \) and \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \).
   - If no such \( A \) and \( B \) exist, return \( A = B = -1 \).

2. **Function \( F(N) \):**
   - For each \( N \), determine \( B \) from the XPR.

3. **Function \( G(L, R) \):**
   - Sum up \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

4. **Efficient Calculation:**
   - For each \( N \), iterate over possible values of \( A \) starting from 1.
   - Calculate \( B = A \oplus N \).
   - Check if \( A \le B \le N \). If true, this is the valid pair.
   - If no valid pair is found, return -1 for both \( A \) and \( B \).

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) for a given positive integer \( N \) such that:
- \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \)
- \( A \oplus B = N \)
- \( A \) is the smallest possible value that satisfies the above conditions.

If no such pair exists, \( A = B = -1 \). The function \( F(N) \) returns the value of \( B \) in this pair. We then define another function \( G(L, R) \) which is the sum of \( F(i) \) for all integers \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

Given multiple test cases, each with a range \( [L, R] \), we need to compute \( G(L, R) \) for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR Pair Representation (XPR):**
   - For a given \( N \), find the smallest \( A \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \) and \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \).
   - If no such \( A \) and \( B \) exist, return \( A = B = -1 \).

2. **Function \( F(N) \):**
   - For each \( N \), determine \( B \) from the XPR.

3. **Function \( G(L, R) \):**
   - Sum up \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

4. **Efficient Calculation:**
   - For each \( N \), iterate over possible values of \( A \) starting from 1.
   - Calculate \( B = A \oplus N \).
   - Check if \( A \le B \le N \). If true, this is the valid pair.
   - If no valid pair is found, return -1 for both \( A \) and \( B \).

### Pseudocode

```
function F(N):
    for A from 1 to N:
        B = A XOR N
        if A <= B <= N:
            return B
    return -1

function G(L, R):
    sum = 0
    for i from L to R:
        sum += F(i)
    return sum

read T
for each test case:
    read L, R
    print G(L, R)
```

### Python Code

```python
def F(N):
    for A in range(1, N + 1):
        B = A ^ N
        if A <= B <= N:
            return B
    return -1

def G(L, R):
    total = 0
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        total += F(i)
    return total

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(G(L, R))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

main()
```

This code reads multiple test cases, computes the sum of \( F(i) \) for each range \( [L, R] \), and outputs the result for each test case. The function \( F(N) \) efficiently finds the smallest \( A \) and corresponding \( B \) for each \( N \).

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] In this problem, the main task was to compute a function \( G(L, R) \) which sums up the values of another function \( F(N) \) over a range. The function \( F(N) \) is derived from finding a pair \( (A, B) \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \) with constraints \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \). The challenge was to efficiently compute this for large ranges and multiple test cases.

The core concept here was understanding the properties of the XOR operation and how it can be used to derive the pair \( (A, B) \). The strategy that worked was iterating over possible values of \( A \) and computing \( B \) as \( A \oplus N \). The constraints \( A \le B \le N \) were crucial in determining valid pairs.

The solution involved reading input efficiently and processing each test case by iterating over the range \( [L, R] \) to compute \( G(L, R) \). The implementation was straightforward once the properties of XOR were understood, and the solution passed all test cases without any unexpected errors. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding bitwise operations and their applications in algorithmic problem-solving.

- otherwise, the value of $A$ should be the smallest possible
These conditions uniquely define the XPR. Next, we define a function $F(N)$ = the value of $B$ in $XPR(N)$, and a function $G(L, R) = \sum\limits_{i=L}^R F(i)$.
You are given $L$ and $R$. Compute $G(L, R)$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the value of the function $G(L, R)$.

We need to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) for a given positive integer \( N \) such that:
- \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \)
- \( A \oplus B = N \)
- \( A \) is the smallest possible value that satisfies the above conditions.

If no such pair exists, \( A = B = -1 \). The function \( F(N) \) returns the value of \( B \) in this pair. We then define another function \( G(L, R) \) which is the sum of \( F(i) \) for all integers \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

Given multiple test cases, each with a range \( [L, R] \), we need to compute \( G(L, R) \) for each test case.

   - For a given \( N \), find the smallest \( A \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \) and \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \).

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] The problem of finding the XOR pair representation (XPR) and computing the function \( G(L, R) \) was approached in two different ways: my initial solution and the official solution.

### My Approach
My solution involved directly iterating over each number \( N \) in the range \([L, R]\) and finding the smallest \( A \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \) and \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \). This approach was straightforward but computationally expensive, especially given the constraints where \( R \) can be as large as \( 10^9 \). The time complexity was not optimal for large ranges, as it involved iterating over each number and checking possible values of \( A \).

### Official Solution
The official solution takes a more mathematical approach to solve the problem efficiently. It leverages properties of numbers and bit manipulation to compute the sum of \( F(i) \) over a range without iterating through each number individually. Here's a breakdown of the key insights:

1. **Summation Formula**: The official solution uses a formula to compute the sum of numbers up to \( x \), which is \( \text{summation\_N} = \frac{x(x+1)}{2} \).

2. **Bit Manipulation**: The solution calculates the sum of \( A \) values using bit manipulation. It iterates over powers of 2, counting how many numbers in the range have a particular bit set.

3. **Efficient Range Calculation**: By calculating the sum for a range \([1, r]\) and subtracting the sum for \([1, l-1]\), the solution efficiently computes \( G(L, R) \).

4. **Logarithmic Calculation**: The use of logarithms helps determine the number of bits needed, which is crucial for the bit manipulation part.

### Insights
The official solution is significantly more efficient, especially for large ranges, due to its mathematical approach and use of bit manipulation. It avoids the need to iterate over each number in the range, reducing the time complexity. This approach is a great example of how understanding the properties of numbers and bitwise operations can lead to more efficient algorithms. In future problems involving large ranges and bitwise operations, considering mathematical properties and efficient range calculations can be highly beneficial.
