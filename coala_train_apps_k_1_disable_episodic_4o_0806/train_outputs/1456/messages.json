The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This approach was straightforward but computationally expensive, especially given the constraints where \\( R \\) can be as large as \\( 10^9 \\).

It leverages properties of numbers and bit manipulation to compute the sum of \\( F(i) \\) over a range without iterating through each number individually. Here's a breakdown of the key insights:\n\n1. **Summation Formula**: The official solution uses a formula to compute the sum of numbers up to \\( x \\), which is \\( \\text{summation\\_N} = \\frac{x(x+1)}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Bit Manipulation**: The solution calculates the sum of \\( A \\) values using bit manipulation.

It avoids the need to iterate over each number in the range, reducing the time complexity. This approach is a great example of how understanding the properties of numbers and bitwise operations can lead to more efficient algorithms. In future problems involving large ranges and bitwise operations, considering mathematical properties and efficient range calculations can be highly beneficial."
