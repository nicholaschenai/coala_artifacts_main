    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nYou are given a list of days on which you plan to travel and the costs of three types of train passes: a 1-day pass, a 7-day pass, and a 30-day pass. Each pass allows you to travel for the specified number of consecutive days. The goal is to determine the minimum cost required to cover all the travel days using these passes.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to calculate the minimum cost to cover travel up to each day in the list. We will maintain a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel up to the `i-th` day in the `days` list.\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with a `dp` array of size equal to the number of travel days, initialized to zero.\n\n2. **Iterate through each travel day**: For each day, calculate the minimum cost by considering the three options:\n   - Buy a 1-day pass for the current day.\n   - Buy a 7-day pass that covers the current day.\n   - Buy a 30-day pass that covers the current day.\n\n3. **Cost Calculation**:\n   - For a 1-day pass, add the cost of a 1-day pass to the cost up to the previous day.\n   - For a 7-day pass, add the cost of a 7-day pass to the cost up to the last day not covered by the 7-day pass.\n   - For a 30-day pass, add the cost of a 30-day pass to the cost up to the last day not covered by the 30-day pass.\n\n4. **Return the result**: The last element in the `dp` array will give the minimum cost to cover all travel days.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction mincostTickets(days, costs):\n    n = length of days\n    dp = array of size n, initialized to 0\n    for i from 0 to n-1:\n        cost1 = cost of 1-day pass + (dp[i-1] if i > 0 else 0)\n        j = find the index of the first day not covered by a 7-day pass\n        cost7 = cost of 7-day pass + (dp[j-1] if j > 0 else 0)\n        k = find the index of the first day not covered by a 30-day pass\n        cost30 = cost of 30-day pass + (dp[k-1] if k > 0 else 0)\n        dp[i] = min(cost1, cost7, cost30)\n    return dp[n-1]\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(days)\n        dp = [0] * n\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            # Cost for 1-day pass\n            cost1 = costs[0] + (dp[i-1] if i > 0 else 0)\n            \n            # Cost for 7-day pass\n            j = i\n            while j >= 0 and days[j] > days[i] - 7:\n                j -= 1\n            cost7 = costs[1] + (dp[j] if j >= 0 else 0)\n            \n            # Cost for 30-day pass\n            k = i\n            while k >= 0 and days[k] > days[i] - 30:\n                k -= 1\n            cost30 = costs[2] + (dp[k] if k >= 0 else 0)\n            \n            # Minimum cost to cover up to the i-th day\n            dp[i] = min(cost1, cost7, cost30)\n        \n        return dp[-1]\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost of covering all travel days with the available passes.",
