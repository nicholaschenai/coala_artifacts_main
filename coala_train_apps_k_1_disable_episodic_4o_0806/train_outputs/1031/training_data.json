    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to determine if a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \\( H \\) and area \\( S \\) could exist, and if so, to find the side lengths. The core concepts involved understanding the properties of right-angled triangles, specifically the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle.\n\nThe main challenge was to derive a mathematical approach to solve for the side lengths \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) using the given \\( H \\) and \\( S \\). By expressing \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\) using the area formula and substituting into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation. Solving this equation allowed us to check for real and positive solutions for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nA key insight was recognizing that the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be non-negative for real solutions to exist. Additionally, ensuring that the calculated side lengths are positive and sorting them in non-decreasing order was crucial for correct output formatting.\n\nThe solution involved careful handling of mathematical operations, especially square roots and divisions, to avoid errors due to negative values or division by zero. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper constraints, processing up to \\( 10^5 \\) test cases with large values for \\( H \\) and \\( S \\). This problem reinforced the importance of mathematical reasoning in algorithm design and the need for precision in floating-point calculations.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse and area, the approach I took was quite similar to the official solution, and both were successful in passing the test cases. Here are some key insights and takeaways from the experience:\n\n1. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - Both solutions correctly identified the need to use the Pythagorean theorem and the area formula to derive a quadratic equation. This was crucial in determining the feasibility of forming a triangle with the given parameters.\n\n2. **Handling the Discriminant**:\n   - The discriminant of the quadratic equation was used to check if real solutions exist. If the discriminant is negative, it indicates that no real triangle can be formed, which both solutions handled by returning -1.\n\n3. **Calculation of Sides**:\n   - The official solution directly calculates the base \\( B \\) and perpendicular \\( P \\) using the derived formulas, ensuring that the sides are calculated accurately. My solution also followed a similar approach but included additional steps to ensure the sides are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n4. **Precision and Output Formatting**:\n   - Both solutions ensure that the output is formatted to a specific precision, which is important for meeting the problem's requirements.\n\n5. **Efficiency**:\n   - Both solutions are efficient in terms of time complexity, as they involve basic arithmetic operations and square root calculations, which are manageable even for the upper constraint limits.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of translating mathematical equations into code and handling edge cases, such as when no valid triangle can be formed. The official solution was concise and effective, and my approach aligned well with it, confirming the correctness of the mathematical reasoning and implementation.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers representing the height and area of a triangle. It then calculates the possible side lengths of the triangle using another function and checks if a valid triangle can be formed. If a valid triangle is found, it formats the side lengths to five decimal places and stores them; otherwise, it stores \"-1\" to indicate an invalid triangle. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the feasibility of constructing a right-angled triangle given specific constraints on the hypotenuse and area. This can be applied in geometry problems, computer graphics, and design where specific triangle dimensions are required. It is also useful in educational settings to test understanding of the Pythagorean theorem and properties of triangles. Additionally, this solution can be adapted to solve similar problems where constraints are given on other properties of geometric shapes."
