INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If no such triangle can exist, we should output \(-1\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Given Conditions**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( A = S \).

3. **Formulate the Problem**:
   - From the area formula: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - From the Pythagorean theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).

4. **Solve for \( a \) and \( b \)**:
   - Express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the area equation: \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Substitute \( b \) in the Pythagorean equation: \( a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2 \).
   - Simplify and solve the resulting quadratic equation in terms of \( a^2 \).

5. **Check for Validity**:
   - Ensure that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is non-negative for real solutions.
   - Calculate \( a \) and \( b \) and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality and area conditions.

6. **Output**:
   - If valid \( a \) and \( b \) are found, output them along with \( H \) in sorted order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output \(-1\).

## Pseudocode

```
function find_triangle_sides(H, S):
    if 4 * S > H^2:
        return -1
    discriminant = H^4 - 16 * S^2
    if discriminant < 0:
        return -1
    a_squared = (H^2 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    b_squared = (H^2 - sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    if a_squared < 0 or b_squared < 0:
        return -1
    a = sqrt(a_squared)
    b = sqrt(b_squared)
    return sorted([a, b, H])

read T
for each test case:
    read H, S
    result = find_triangle_sides(H, S)
    print result
```

## Python Code

```python

def find_triangle_sides(H, S):
    # Check if the area is too large for the given hypotenuse
    if 4 * S > H * H:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation
    discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S
    
    # If the discriminant is negative, no real solutions exist
    if discriminant < 0:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate a^2 and b^2 using the quadratic formula
    a_squared = (H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    b_squared = (H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    
    # If either a^2 or b^2 is negative, no valid triangle sides exist
    if a_squared < 0 or b_squared < 0:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the actual side lengths
    a = math.sqrt(a_squared)
    b = math.sqrt(b_squared)
    
    # Return the sides sorted in non-decreasing order
    return f"{min(a, b):.5f} {max(a, b):.5f} {H:.5f}"

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, I gained several insights that could be useful for future challenges:

    1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The key to solving this problem efficiently was recognizing that the task was essentially about finding perfect squares that could be doubled to fit within the given `N`. This insight allowed for a more direct approach rather than iterating over all possible boxes.

    2. **Efficient Calculation**: The official solution leverages the mathematical property of perfect squares and uses integer division and square root calculations to directly compute the number of rooms that can be tiled. This approach is both time-efficient and straightforward, reducing the complexity from iterating over all numbers up to `N` to simply calculating the integer square root of `N/2`.

    3. **Simplifying the Problem**: By dividing `N` by 2 upfront, the problem is simplified to finding how many perfect squares exist up to `N/2`. This simplification is a powerful technique in problem-solving, where reducing the problem space can lead to more efficient solutions.

    4. **Python Built-ins**: The use of Python's built-in functions like `int()` for floor division and `**0.5` for square root calculations demonstrates the importance of understanding and utilizing language features to write concise and efficient code.

    Overall, the official solution provided a more elegant and efficient approach than my initial attempts, highlighting the importance of mathematical insights and simplification in algorithm design.

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If no such triangle exists, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Given Conditions**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( A = S \).

3. **Formulate the Problem**:
   - From the area formula: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - From the Pythagorean theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).

4. **Solve for \( a \) and \( b \)**:
   - Express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the area equation: \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Substitute \( b \) in the Pythagorean equation: \( a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2 \).
   - Simplify and solve the resulting quadratic equation in terms of \( a \).

5. **Check for Valid Solutions**:
   - Ensure that the solutions for \( a \) and \( b \) are real and positive.
   - If valid, output the sides in non-decreasing order. If not, output -1.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If no such triangle exists, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Given Conditions**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( A = S \).

3. **Formulate the Problem**:
   - From the area formula: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - From the Pythagorean theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).

4. **Solve for \( a \) and \( b \)**:
   - Express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the area equation: \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Substitute \( b \) in the Pythagorean equation: \( a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2 \).
   - Simplify and solve the resulting quadratic equation in terms of \( a \).

5. **Check for Valid Solutions**:
   - Ensure that the solutions for \( a \) and \( b \) are real and positive.
   - If valid, output the sides in non-decreasing order. If not, output -1.

## Pseudocode

        if discriminant < 0:

            a1 = (H^2 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2

                b = 2 * S / a
                return sorted([a, b, H])

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine if a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \) could exist, and if so, to find the side lengths. The core concepts involved understanding the properties of right-angled triangles, specifically the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle.

The main challenge was to derive a mathematical approach to solve for the side lengths \( a \) and \( b \) using the given \( H \) and \( S \). By expressing \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the area formula and substituting into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation. Solving this equation allowed us to check for real and positive solutions for \( a \) and \( b \).

A key insight was recognizing that the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be non-negative for real solutions to exist. Additionally, ensuring that the calculated side lengths are positive and sorting them in non-decreasing order was crucial for correct output formatting.

The solution involved careful handling of mathematical operations, especially square roots and divisions, to avoid errors due to negative values or division by zero. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper constraints, processing up to \( 10^5 \) test cases with large values for \( H \) and \( S \). This problem reinforced the importance of mathematical reasoning in algorithm design and the need for precision in floating-point calculations.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse and area, the approach I took was quite similar to the official solution, and both were successful in passing the test cases. Here are some key insights and takeaways from the experience:

1. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - Both solutions correctly identified the need to use the Pythagorean theorem and the area formula to derive a quadratic equation. This was crucial in determining the feasibility of forming a triangle with the given parameters.

2. **Handling the Discriminant**:
   - The discriminant of the quadratic equation was used to check if real solutions exist. If the discriminant is negative, it indicates that no real triangle can be formed, which both solutions handled by returning -1.

3. **Calculation of Sides**:
   - The official solution directly calculates the base \( B \) and perpendicular \( P \) using the derived formulas, ensuring that the sides are calculated accurately. My solution also followed a similar approach but included additional steps to ensure the sides are sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Precision and Output Formatting**:
   - Both solutions ensure that the output is formatted to a specific precision, which is important for meeting the problem's requirements.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - Both solutions are efficient in terms of time complexity, as they involve basic arithmetic operations and square root calculations, which are manageable even for the upper constraint limits.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of translating mathematical equations into code and handling edge cases, such as when no valid triangle can be formed. The official solution was concise and effective, and my approach aligned well with it, confirming the correctness of the mathematical reasoning and implementation.

The main function is `main`.
INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers representing the height and area of a triangle. It then calculates the possible side lengths of the triangle using another function and checks if a valid triangle can be formed. If a valid triangle is found, it formats the side lengths to five decimal places and stores them; otherwise, it stores "-1" to indicate an invalid triangle. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

[Problem]
    Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
    Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

    -----Input-----
    The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
    For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

    -----Output-----
    Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
    - 1 â‰¤ H â‰¤ 106
    - 1 â‰¤ S â‰¤ 1012
