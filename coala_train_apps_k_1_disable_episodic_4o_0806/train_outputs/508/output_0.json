    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\nWe have a street represented as a number line with several roadworks that block specific points for certain time intervals. Multiple people start walking from the origin (coordinate 0) at different times, moving eastward at a constant speed of 1 unit per time unit. Each person stops walking when they reach a blocked point. We need to determine how far each person walks before stopping or if they walk indefinitely without encountering a blocked point.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n- First, we need to organize the roadworks by their start and end times to efficiently determine when a point is blocked.\n- For each person, calculate the time they reach each roadwork point and check if the point is blocked at that time.\n- If a person reaches a blocked point during its blocked interval, they stop there.\n- If a person never reaches a blocked point, they walk indefinitely.\n- Use a sorted list of events (start and end of blockages) to efficiently determine the status of each point as each person walks.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n```\n1. Parse the input to get the number of roadworks (N) and people (Q).\n2. Create a list of events for each roadwork: (start_time, 'start', X) and (end_time, 'end', X).\n3. Sort the events by time, with 'end' events before 'start' events if they have the same time.\n4. Initialize a set to keep track of currently blocked points.\n5. For each person starting at time D_i:\n   a. Initialize the current position to 0.\n   b. Iterate over the sorted events:\n      i. If the event time is greater than the current time + current position, break the loop.\n      ii. If the event is a 'start', add the point to the blocked set.\n      iii. If the event is an 'end', remove the point from the blocked set.\n      iv. If the current position is in the blocked set, print the current position and break.\n   c. If no blocked point is encountered, print -1.\n```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read number of roadworks and people\n    index = 0\n    N = int(data[index])\n    Q = int(data[index + 1])\n    index += 2\n    \n    # Read roadworks data\n    events = []\n    for _ in range(N):\n        S = int(data[index])\n        T = int(data[index + 1])\n        X = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        # Add start and end events for each roadwork\n        events.append((S - 0.5, 'start', X))\n        events.append((T - 0.5, 'end', X))\n    \n    # Read people's start times\n    D = []\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        D.append(int(data[index]))\n        index += 1\n    \n    # Sort events by time, with 'end' before 'start' if times are equal\n    events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1] == 'start'))\n    \n    # Process each person\n    results = []\n    blocked_points = set()\n    event_index = 0\n    for d in D:\n        current_position = 0\n        # Process events up to the current time\n        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index][0] <= d + current_position:\n            time, event_type, x = events[event_index]\n            if event_type == 'start':\n                blocked_points.add(x)\n            elif event_type == 'end':\n                blocked_points.discard(x)\n            event_index += 1\n        \n        # Check if the current position is blocked\n        while current_position in blocked_points:\n            results.append(current_position)\n            break\n        else:\n            # If no blocked point is encountered, they walk indefinitely\n            results.append(-1)\n    \n    # Print results for each person\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```",
