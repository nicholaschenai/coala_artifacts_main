## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
1 3
5
0 0
2 0
0 4
1 1
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
0
1
2
1
-1

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to help Chef reach Dr. Doof by determining how many walls Chef needs to break through. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, each starting from a point on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis. For each starting position of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are in his path to the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Walls**: Each wall is represented by a line segment from `(a_i, 0)` to `(0, a_i)`. The equation of such a line is `x + y = a_i`.

2. **Chef's Position**: For each query, Chef starts at `(x_j, y_j)`. We need to check:
   - If `x_j + y_j = a_i` for any `a_i`, Chef is on a wall, and we return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, count how many `a_i` are greater than `x_j + y_j` because these are the walls Chef needs to break through.

3. **Efficient Search**: Since the `a_i` values are sorted, we can use binary search to efficiently determine how many walls Chef needs to break through.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_queries(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = number of walls
        a = list of wall positions
        Q = number of queries
        queries = list of starting positions

        for each query (x_j, y_j):
            sum_xy = x_j + y_j

            if sum_xy is in a:
                print -1
            else:
                count = number of a_i greater than sum_xy
                print count

function main():
    read T
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        read N
        read list a of size N
        read Q
        read list of queries of size Q
        test_cases.append((N, a, Q, queries))
    
    process_queries(T, test_cases)
```

### Python Code

```python
def process_queries(T, test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, a, Q, queries = test_case
        
        for x_j, y_j in queries:
            sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
            # Check if sum_xy is on any wall
            if sum_xy in a:
                print(-1)
            else:
                # Use binary search to find the number of walls to break
                # Find the first index where a[i] > sum_xy
                low, high = 0, N
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if a[mid] > sum_xy:
                        high = mid
                    else:
                        low = mid + 1
                
                # The number of walls to break is from index `low` to the end
                print(N - low)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    test_cases = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        Q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        queries = []
        for _ in range(Q):
            x_j = int(data[index])
            y_j = int(data[index + 1])
            queries.append((x_j, y_j))
            index += 2
        test_cases.append((N, a, Q, queries))
    
    process_queries(T, test_cases)

```

This code reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the number of walls Chef needs to break through for each query. It uses binary search to efficiently determine the number of walls in Chef's path.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
1 3
5
0 0
2 0
0 4
1 1
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
0
1
2
1
-1

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

INFO - [Task id] 970 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to help Chef reach Dr. Doof by determining how many walls Chef needs to break through. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, each starting from a point on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis. For each starting position of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are in his path to the origin (0, 0). If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - For each test case, we are given a list of walls, each defined by a coordinate `a_i` which forms a line from `(a_i, 0)` to `(0, a_i)`.
   - For each query, we need to check if the starting point `(x_j, y_j)` lies on any of these walls. If it does, return -1.
   - If not, count how many walls are crossed by the line from `(x_j, y_j)` to `(0, 0)`.
   - A point `(x_j, y_j)` lies on the wall defined by `a_i` if `x_j + y_j == a_i`.
   - To count the walls Chef needs to break, count how many `a_i` are greater than `x_j` and `y_j`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   For each test case:
       Read N (number of walls)

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break to reach the origin from a given starting point. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant, and the task involves checking if a starting point lies on a wall and counting the walls that need to be crossed.

Key strategies included:
- Using a set to quickly check if a starting point lies on any wall. This is efficient because checking membership in a set is generally faster than in a list.
- Iterating through the list of wall coordinates to count how many walls are greater than both the x and y coordinates of the starting point. This ensures that we only count walls that are actually in the path to the origin.

The solution was straightforward, and the use of basic data structures like lists and sets was sufficient to solve the problem efficiently. The constraints were handled by ensuring that operations like membership checks and comparisons were optimized using appropriate data structures. Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structures for efficient computation.

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] In reflecting on the problem and the official solution, there are a few key insights and takeaways:

1. **Binary Search for Efficiency:**
   - The official solution uses a binary search approach to efficiently determine the number of walls Chef needs to break. This is a significant improvement over my initial approach, which involved iterating through the list of walls for each query. The binary search reduces the time complexity from O(N) per query to O(log N), which is crucial given the constraints.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The official solution effectively handles the edge cases where the sum of the coordinates `(x_j + y_j)` is less than the smallest wall coordinate or greater than the largest. This is done by checking these conditions before entering the binary search loop, ensuring that the function returns the correct number of walls to break or `-1` if the point lies on a wall.

3. **Use of Helper Function:**
   - The `posSearch` function is a well-structured helper function that encapsulates the logic for determining the position of the sum `a = x_j + y_j` in the sorted list of wall coordinates. This modular approach makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

4. **Comparison with My Approach:**
   - My initial approach was straightforward but not optimal for large inputs due to its linear search for each query. The official solution's use of binary search is a more scalable approach, especially given the constraints where N and Q can be as large as 200,000.

In summary, the official solution provides a more efficient and scalable approach to solving the problem by leveraging binary search. This experience highlights the importance of considering algorithmic efficiency and the use of appropriate data structures and algorithms, such as binary search, to handle large input sizes effectively.

solve()


The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] The function reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. For each test case, it first reads the number of walls and their respective heights, followed by the number of queries. For each query, it checks if the sum of the given coordinates is on a wall; if so, it appends "-1" to the results. If not, it counts how many walls have heights greater than both coordinates and appends this count to the results. Finally, it outputs the results for all queries across all test cases.

[Problem]
    You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
    Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

    -----Input-----
    - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
    - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
    - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
    - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
    - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

    -----Output-----
    For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
    - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
    - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
    - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
    - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
    - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

    -----Sample Input-----
    1
    2
    1 3
    5
    0 0
    2 0
    0 4
    1 1
    1 2

    -----Sample Output-----
    0
    1
    2
    1
    -1

    -----Explanation-----
    The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

    If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

    If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

    If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

    If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

    As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.
