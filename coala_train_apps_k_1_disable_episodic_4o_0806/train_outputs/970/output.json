    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to help Chef reach Dr. Doof by determining how many walls Chef needs to break through. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, each starting from a point on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis. For each starting position of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are in his path to the origin (0, 0). If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - For each test case, we are given a list of walls, each defined by a coordinate `a_i` which forms a line from `(a_i, 0)` to `(0, a_i)`.\n   - For each query, we need to check if the starting point `(x_j, y_j)` lies on any of these walls. If it does, return -1.\n   - If not, count how many walls are crossed by the line from `(x_j, y_j)` to `(0, 0)`.\n   - A point `(x_j, y_j)` lies on the wall defined by `a_i` if `x_j + y_j == a_i`.\n   - To count the walls Chef needs to break, count how many `a_i` are greater than `x_j` and `y_j`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   For each test case:\n       Read N (number of walls)\n       Read the list of wall coordinates a_i\n       Read Q (number of queries)\n       For each query:\n           Read the starting point (x_j, y_j)\n           If x_j + y_j is in the list of a_i:\n               Print -1\n           Else:\n               Count how many a_i are greater than both x_j and y_j\n               Print the count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        walls = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        Q = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        \n        wall_set = set(walls)  # To quickly check if a point is on a wall\n        \n        for _ in range(Q):\n            x_j = int(data[index])\n            y_j = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            \n            # Check if the point is on any wall\n            if x_j + y_j in wall_set:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                # Count walls that need to be broken\n                count = 0\n                for a_i in walls:\n                    if a_i > x_j and a_i > y_j:\n                        count += 1\n                results.append(str(count))\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nThis solution reads input data, processes each test case, and outputs the number of walls Chef needs to break for each query. It efficiently checks if a starting point is on a wall and counts the walls that need to be broken using simple comparisons.",
