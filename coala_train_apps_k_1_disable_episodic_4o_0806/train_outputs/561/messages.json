There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 102\n- 1 \u2264 K,Ai \u2264 109\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2 \n4 9\n5 2 2 4\n4 9\n5 2 18 3\n\nOutput:\nYES\nNO\n\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.\nExample case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe have a number of test cases. For each test case, we are given:\n- `N`: the number of minions.\n- `K`: the total amount of money Gru has.\n- A list of `N` integers, each representing the amount of money a minion demands.\n\nThe task is to determine if Gru can distribute all his money (`K`) among the minions such that he has no money left. Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount is less than or equal to the money he has left at that point.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. For each test case, we need to check if there is a combination of the minions' demands that sums exactly to `K`.\n2. This is a classic subset sum problem where we need to determine if a subset of the given demands can sum up to `K`.\n3. We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently:\n   - Use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a sum of `j` can be achieved with the given demands.\n   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `True` because a sum of zero can always be achieved with an empty subset.\n   - For each demand, update the `dp` array from back to front to avoid using the same demand multiple times.\n   - After processing all demands, check if `dp[K]` is `True`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction canSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, demands = test_case\n        dp = array of size (K+1) initialized to False\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        for each demand in demands:\n            for j from K down to demand:\n                if dp[j - demand] is True:\n                    dp[j] = True\n        \n        if dp[K] is True:\n            print \"YES\"\n        else:\n            print \"NO\"\n```\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef canSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, demands = test_case\n        # Initialize a dp array of size K+1 with False\n        dp = [False] * (K + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # Base case: sum of 0 is always possible\n        \n        # Process each demand\n        for demand in demands:\n            # Update dp array from back to front\n            for j in range(K, demand - 1, -1):\n                if dp[j - demand]:\n                    dp[j] = True\n        \n        # Check if we can achieve the sum K\n        if dp[K]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    K = int(data[index + 1])\n    demands = list(map(int, data[index + 2:index + 2 + N]))\n    test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n    index += 2 + N\n\n# Call the function\ncanSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case using a dynamic programming approach to solve the subset sum problem, and prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on whether Gru can spend all his money."

Gru has a certain amount of money, and he will only give money to a minion if the amount they request is less than or equal to the money he has left. The task is to determine if Gru can distribute all his money to the minions such that he is left with zero money.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: We need to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, we are given the number of minions and the total amount of money Gru has. We are also given a list of money amounts each minion requests.\n\n2. **Check Feasibility**: For each test case, we need to check if the sum of the money requested by the minions is exactly equal to the amount of money Gru has. If the sum of the requests is equal to Gru's total money, then it's possible for Gru to distribute all his money.\n\n3. **Output**: For each test case, output \"YES\" if Gru can distribute all his money, otherwise output \"NO\".\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K = test_case[0]  # Number of minions and total money Gru has\n        demands = test_case[1]  # List of money demands by each minion\n        \n        if sum(demands) == K:\n            print \"YES\"\n        else:\n            print \"NO\"\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K = test_case[0]  # Number of minions and total money Gru has\n        demands = test_case[1]  # List of money demands by each minion\n        \n        # Check if the sum of demands is equal to the money Gru has\n        if sum(demands) == K:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    K = int(data[index + 1])\n    demands = list(map(int, data[index + 2:index + 2 + N]))\n    test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n    index += 2 + N\n\n# Call the function with parsed input\ncan_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into manageable parts.

This means that the sum of the money requested by the minions should exactly equal the amount of money Gru has.\n\n### Solution Analysis\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read as a single string and split into parts. We then parse the number of test cases and for each test case, extract the number of minions, the total money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n\n2. **Logic**: For each test case, we check if the sum of the demands equals the total money Gru has.

The current solution only checks if the sum of all demands equals the total money Gru has, but it doesn't consider the condition that Gru can only give money to a minion if the requested amount is less than or equal to the money he has left at that point.\n\n### Corrected Approach\n\n1. **Sort the Demands**: Sort the list of demands in ascending order.

This is a classic problem of checking if a subset of numbers can sum up to a specific target, which is a variation of the subset sum problem.\n\n#### Strategies and Errors\nInitially, I attempted to solve the problem by checking if the sum of all demands equaled the total money Gru had. This approach failed because it didn't account for the condition that Gru can only give money to a minion if the requested amount is less than or equal to the money he has left at that point.\n\nI then tried a greedy approach by sorting the demands and attempting to fulfill them in ascending order. This also failed because it didn't ensure that the exact sum of demands matched the total money Gru had.\n\n#### Correct Approach\nThe correct approach is to directly check if the sum of all demands equals the total money Gru has. This ensures that Gru can distribute all his money exactly, without any remaining. The problem was simpler than initially thought, and the solution required a straightforward sum comparison rather than a complex algorithm.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n- Always ensure that the solution directly addresses the problem's requirements.\n- Sometimes, the problem might be simpler than it appears, and a direct approach can be more effective than overcomplicating the solution.\n- Carefully read and understand the problem constraints and requirements to avoid unnecessary complexity."

This means finding a subset of demands that sum up exactly to the total money Gru has. My initial approach focused on checking if the total sum of demands matched the available money, which was incorrect because it didn't consider the need for an exact subset sum.\n\n2. **Subset Sum Problem**: The official solution effectively treats this as a subset sum problem, which is a classic problem in computer science. The solution uses a recursive approach to find all combinations of the demands that sum up to the given amount. This is a more comprehensive approach as it checks all possible subsets, not just the total sum.\n\n3. **Recursive Approach**: The official solution uses recursion to explore all possible combinations of the demands. It checks if excluding or including each demand can lead to a sum that matches the available money. This approach is more aligned with the problem's requirements and ensures that all possibilities are considered.\n\n4. **Sorting for Efficiency**: Although the official solution sorts the demands, the primary purpose of sorting in this context is not explicitly clear from the code. However, sorting can sometimes help in pruning the search space in recursive solutions, though it wasn't leveraged in this particular implementation.\n\n5. **Learning from Mistakes**: The main takeaway from my failed attempts is the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and requirements. It's crucial to ensure that the solution logic aligns with the problem's needs, especially when dealing with subset or combination problems.\n\nIn summary, the official solution provides a more robust approach by leveraging recursion to explore all possible subsets of demands, ensuring that the exact sum can be achieved. This experience highlights the importance of considering all possible scenarios in problems involving combinations or subsets."
