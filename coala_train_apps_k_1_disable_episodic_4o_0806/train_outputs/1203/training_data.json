    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position in a sorted subset of numbers from 1 to N. The key concepts involved were combinatorial mathematics and efficient computation using precomputed factorials and modular arithmetic.\n\n### Core Concepts:\n- **Combinatorial Counting**: The problem required calculating combinations to determine how many ways we can choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers, ensuring `I` is at the `K`-th position.\n- **Subset Counting**: After placing `I`, the remaining numbers in the subset can be any subset of numbers greater than `I`, which can be calculated using powers of 2.\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the results could be large, all calculations were done modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Strategies:\n- **Precomputation**: Precomputing factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N` (4000) allowed for efficient combination calculations.\n- **Efficient Input/Output Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write` for handling large input and output efficiently.\n\n### Errors and Fixes:\n- **Function Call**: Initially, the function `solve()` was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is invoked fixed the issue.\n- **Input/Output Handling**: Properly reading input and writing output was crucial, especially given the large constraints.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of precomputation for efficiency in combinatorial problems and highlighted the need for careful handling of input/output in competitive programming scenarios.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Combinatorial Counting**: Both my solution and the official solution rely on combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position. This involves calculating combinations to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers and using powers of 2 to account for the remaining numbers.\n\n2. **Efficiency in Computation**: My solution precomputes factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations using the formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\). This approach is efficient for large values of `N` and `K`, as it avoids recalculating factorials for each query. The official solution, however, uses a more direct approach with loops to calculate combinations, which might be less efficient for larger inputs but is straightforward and avoids the need for precomputation.\n\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly handle large numbers by using modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.\n\n4. **Function Execution**: A key issue in my initial attempts was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output being produced. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed, especially when using functions to encapsulate the solution.\n\n5. **Input/Output Handling**: The official solution uses `input()` and `print()` for handling input and output, which is straightforward and works well for competitive programming environments. My solution used `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write`, which are efficient for handling large input and output but require careful management of data parsing and function execution.\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations, careful handling of input/output, and ensuring that the main logic is executed. The official solution provides a simpler, albeit potentially less efficient, approach to the problem, which can be useful in scenarios where precomputation is not feasible or necessary.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThe function reads input data for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of elements and a series of queries. For each query, it calculates the number of ways to choose a specific number of elements from a given position in a sequence, considering the constraints of the problem. It uses precomputed factorials and modular inverses to efficiently compute combinations modulo a large prime number. The results for each query are stored and then outputted at the end. The function handles multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the results are computed and printed in the correct order.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to calculate the number of subsets of a set with specific constraints, such as the position of an element in the subset. This is particularly relevant in combinatorial problems where subsets need to be generated in a sorted order, and specific elements must occupy certain positions. The solution involves combinatorial mathematics, specifically the use of combinations and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, which is common in competitive programming and algorithm design. Understanding how to precompute factorials and their modular inverses is also crucial for efficiently solving problems with large constraints."
