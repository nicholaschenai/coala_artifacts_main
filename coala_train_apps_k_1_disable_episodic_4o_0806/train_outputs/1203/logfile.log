-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N. For each query, we need to determine how many subsets exist where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number `I` to be at the `K`-th position in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers smaller than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

2. **Remaining Numbers**: After placing `I` at the `K`-th position, the remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the set `{I+1, I+2, ..., N}`. The number of such numbers is `N-I`.

3. **Combinatorial Counting**:
   - Choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers: This is done using combinations, denoted as `C(I-1, K-1)`.
   - Choose any subset of the remaining `N-I` numbers: This is `2^(N-I)` possible subsets.

4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, every calculation should be done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute combinations and powers of 2, precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

### Pseudocode

1. **Precompute Factorials and Inverses**:
   - Compute factorials and their inverses up to the maximum `N` using Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverses.

2. **Process Each Test Case**:
   - For each query `(I, K)`, check if `K-1` is greater than `I-1`. If true, the result is 0 because we can't choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1`.
   - Otherwise, compute the result as `C(I-1, K-1) * 2^(N-I) % MOD`.

3. **Output Results**:
   - Print the result for each query.

                result = comb * power_of_two % MOD
                results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N. For each query, we need to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Remaining Numbers**: After placing `I` at the `K`-th position, the remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the set `{I+1, I+2, ..., N}`. The number of such subsets is determined by the number of ways to choose any subset from these numbers.

4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, compute all results modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

   - Otherwise, calculate the number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1`.
   - Calculate the number of subsets from the remaining numbers.

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----

- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N. For each query, we need to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number `I` to be at the `K`-th position in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers smaller than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

2. **Remaining Numbers**: After placing `I` at the `K`-th position, the remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the set `{I+1, I+2, ..., N}`. The number of such subsets is determined by the number of ways to choose any subset from these numbers.

3. **Combinatorial Counting**: 
   - Use combinations to count the number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers.
   - Use powers of 2 to count the number of subsets that can be formed from the remaining numbers.

4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, compute all results modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

1. Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to `N` for efficient combination calculations.
2. For each query:
   - If `K > I`, output 0 (since `I` cannot be at the `K`-th position).
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1`.
   - Calculate the number of subsets from the remaining numbers.
   - Multiply these two results and take modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. Output the result for each query.

## Final Python Solution

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def mod_inv(x, mod):
    return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

def precompute_factorials(n, mod):

    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        Q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        for __ in range(Q):
            I = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            if K > I:

            else:
                ways_to_choose_before_I = combination(I - 1, K - 1, fact, inv_fact, MOD)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Reading Input and Output**: The feedback suggests that there is no output detected. This usually indicates an issue with how input is read or how output is written. The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and `sys.stdout.write` to output the results. This approach is correct, but we need to ensure that the function `solve()` is actually called to execute the logic.

2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called anywhere in the code. This is likely the reason why no output is being produced. The function needs to be invoked to process the input and produce the output.

3. **Logic and Computation**: The logic for computing the number of subsets seems correct based on the problem description. It uses combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets for each query. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify if there are any logical errors in the computation.

4. **Output Format**: The output is expected to be a list of results, each on a new line. The current implementation uses `sys.stdout.write` with a newline-separated string, which should be correct if the function is called.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called. Let's update the code to include this function call.

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def mod_inv(x, mod):
    return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

def precompute_factorials(n, mod):
    fact = [1] * (n + 1)
    inv_fact = [1] * (n + 1)

        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i + 1] * (i + 1) % mod

    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    max_n = 4000
    fact, inv_fact = precompute_factorials(max_n, MOD)
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        Q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        for __ in range(Q):
            I = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            if K > I:
                results.append(0)
            else:
                ways_to_choose_before_I = combination(I - 1, K - 1, fact, inv_fact, MOD)
                ways_to_choose_after_I = pow(2, N - I, MOD)

    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the solution
solve()
```

By adding the call to `solve()`, the function will be executed, and the input will be processed to produce the expected output. This should resolve the issue of no output being detected.

2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called anywhere in the code. This is likely the reason why no output is being produced. The function needs to be invoked to process the input and produce the output.

3. **Logic and Computation**: The logic for computing the number of subsets seems correct based on the problem description. It uses combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets for each query. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify if there are any logical errors in the computation.

4. **Output Format**: The output is expected to be a list of results, each on a new line. The current implementation uses `sys.stdout.write` with a newline-separated string, which should be correct if the function is called.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called. Let's update the code to include this function call.

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def mod_inv(x, mod):
    return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

def precompute_factorials(n, mod):
    fact = [1] * (n + 1)
    inv_fact = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % mod
    inv_fact[n] = mod_inv(fact[n], mod)
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i + 1] * (i + 1) % mod
    return fact, inv_fact

def combination(n, k, fact, inv_fact, mod):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % mod * inv_fact[n - k] % mod

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    max_n = 4000
    fact, inv_fact = precompute_factorials(max_n, MOD)
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        Q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        for __ in range(Q):
            I = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            if K > I:
                results.append(0)
            else:
                ways_to_choose_before_I = combination(I - 1, K - 1, fact, inv_fact, MOD)
                ways_to_choose_after_I = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                result = ways_to_choose_before_I * ways_to_choose_after_I % MOD

    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the solution

```

By adding the call to `solve()`, the function will be executed, and the input will be processed to produce the expected output. This should resolve the issue of no output being detected.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N. For each query, we need to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number `I` to be at the `K`-th position in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers smaller than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

2. **Remaining Numbers**: After placing `I` at the `K`-th position, the remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the set `{I+1, I+2, ..., N}`. The number of such subsets is determined by the number of ways to choose any subset from these numbers.

3. **Combinatorial Counting**: 
   - Use combinations to count the number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers.
   - Use powers of 2 to count the number of subsets that can be formed from the remaining numbers.

4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, compute all results modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

1. Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to `N` for efficient combination calculations.
2. For each query:
   - If `K > I`, output 0 (since `I` cannot be at the `K`-th position).
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1`.
   - Calculate the number of subsets from the remaining numbers.
   - Multiply these two results and take modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. Output the result for each query.

            if K > I:

            else:
                ways_to_choose_before_I = combination(I - 1, K - 1, fact, inv_fact, MOD)

                results.append(result)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by precomputing factorials and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets for each query.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

1. **Reading Input and Output**: The feedback suggests that there is no output detected. This usually indicates an issue with how input is read or how output is written. The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and `sys.stdout.write` to output the results. This approach is correct, but we need to ensure that the function `solve()` is actually called to execute the logic.

2. **Function Call**: The function `solve()` is defined but not called anywhere in the code. This is likely the reason why no output is being produced. The function needs to be invoked to process the input and produce the output.

3. **Logic and Computation**: The logic for computing the number of subsets seems correct based on the problem description. It uses combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets for each query. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify if there are any logical errors in the computation.

4. **Output Format**: The output is expected to be a list of results, each on a new line. The current implementation uses `sys.stdout.write` with a newline-separated string, which should be correct if the function is called.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called. Let's update the code to include this function call.

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def mod_inv(x, mod):
    return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position in a sorted subset of numbers from 1 to N. The key concepts involved were combinatorial mathematics and efficient computation using precomputed factorials and modular arithmetic.

### Core Concepts:
- **Combinatorial Counting**: The problem required calculating combinations to determine how many ways we can choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers, ensuring `I` is at the `K`-th position.
- **Subset Counting**: After placing `I`, the remaining numbers in the subset can be any subset of numbers greater than `I`, which can be calculated using powers of 2.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the results could be large, all calculations were done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Strategies:
- **Precomputation**: Precomputing factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N` (4000) allowed for efficient combination calculations.
- **Efficient Input/Output Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write` for handling large input and output efficiently.

### Errors and Fixes:
- **Function Call**: Initially, the function `solve()` was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is invoked fixed the issue.
- **Input/Output Handling**: Properly reading input and writing output was crucial, especially given the large constraints.

This problem reinforced the importance of precomputation for efficiency in combinatorial problems and highlighted the need for careful handling of input/output in competitive programming scenarios.

The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N. For each query, we need to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number `I` to be at the `K`-th position in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers smaller than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

2. **Remaining Numbers**: After placing `I` at the `K`-th position, the remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the set `{I+1, I+2, ..., N}`. The number of such subsets is determined by the number of ways to choose any subset from these numbers.

3. **Combinatorial Counting**: 
   - Use combinations to count the number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers.
   - Use powers of 2 to count the number of subsets that can be formed from the remaining numbers.

4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, compute all results modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

1. Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to `N` for efficient combination calculations.
2. For each query:
   - If `K > I`, output 0 (since `I` cannot be at the `K`-th position).
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1`.
   - Calculate the number of subsets from the remaining numbers.
   - Multiply these two results and take modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. Output the result for each query.

MOD = 10**9 + 7

            I = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            if K > I:
                results.append(0)
            else:
                ways_to_choose_before_I = combination(I - 1, K - 1, fact, inv_fact, MOD)

                results.append(result)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by precomputing factorials and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets for each query.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Combinatorial Counting**: Both my solution and the official solution rely on combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position. This involves calculating combinations to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers and using powers of 2 to account for the remaining numbers.

2. **Efficiency in Computation**: My solution precomputes factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations using the formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \). This approach is efficient for large values of `N` and `K`, as it avoids recalculating factorials for each query. The official solution, however, uses a more direct approach with loops to calculate combinations, which might be less efficient for larger inputs but is straightforward and avoids the need for precomputation.

3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly handle large numbers by using modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.

4. **Function Execution**: A key issue in my initial attempts was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output being produced. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed, especially when using functions to encapsulate the solution.

5. **Input/Output Handling**: The official solution uses `input()` and `print()` for handling input and output, which is straightforward and works well for competitive programming environments. My solution used `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write`, which are efficient for handling large input and output but require careful management of data parsing and function execution.

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations, careful handling of input/output, and ensuring that the main logic is executed. The official solution provides a simpler, albeit potentially less efficient, approach to the problem, which can be useful in scenarios where precomputation is not feasible or necessary.

[Problem]
    Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
    number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
    The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


    -----Input:-----
    - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
    - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
    - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case print required answer.

    -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
    - 1<=T<=5
    - 1<=N, K<=4000
    - 1<=Q<=1000000
    Subtask 3: 5 points
    - 1<=T<=5
    - 1<=N, K<=16
    - 1<=Q<=1000
    Subtask 1: 25 points
    - T=1
    - 1<=N, K<=4000
    - 1<=Q<=100000
    Subtask 2: 70 points
    - Original Constraints.

    -----Example:-----
    Input:

    1

    3 3

    1 2

    2 1

    3 2

    Output:

    0

    2

    2

    -----Explanation:-----
    For N=3

    total subsets are:

    {1}

    {2}

    {3}

    {1,2}

    {1,3}

    {2,3}

    {1,2,3}

    Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

    For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

    Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
