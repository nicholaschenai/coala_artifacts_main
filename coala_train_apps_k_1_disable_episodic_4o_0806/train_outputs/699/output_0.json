    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nChef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Given `N` setters, each with a certain number of problems, Chef wants to know the maximum number of contests he can host over `D` days, with the constraint that only one contest can be hosted per day.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Calculate Total Problems:** Sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.\n2. **Determine Maximum Contests:** Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.\n3. **Limit by Days:** The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_contests(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, D = test_case[0]\n        A = test_case[1]\n        \n        total_problems = sum(A)\n        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K\n        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)\n        \n        print max_contests\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_contests(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for i in range(T):\n        N, K, D = test_cases[i][0]\n        A = test_cases[i][1]\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of problems available\n        total_problems = sum(A)\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed\n        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K\n        \n        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D\n        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(max_contests)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 5\n# test_cases = [\n#     ((1, 5, 31), [4]),\n#     ((1, 10, 3), [23]),\n#     ((2, 5, 7), [20, 36]),\n#     ((2, 5, 10), [19, 2]),\n#     ((3, 3, 300), [1, 1, 1])\n# ]\n# max_contests(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads the number of test cases, processes each test case to calculate the total number of problems, determines how many contests can be formed, and then limits this by the number of days available.
