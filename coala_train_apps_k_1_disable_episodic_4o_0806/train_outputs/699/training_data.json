    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that Chef can host given a set of constraints. The core concept involved calculating the total number of problems available and determining how many full contests could be formed, while also considering the limitation of the number of days available.\n\nInitially, the solution failed because it did not handle input and output correctly for a competitive programming environment. The function was defined but not called, and input was not read from standard input. The key takeaway was the importance of correctly managing input and output, especially in environments where the input is provided all at once and needs to be processed in a structured manner.\n\nThe successful strategy involved reading all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, splitting it into manageable parts, and using an index to track the current position in the input data. This approach ensured that all test cases were processed correctly, and results were printed in the required format. This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the input/output requirements and constraints in competitive programming problems.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, the task was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that Chef can host given a set of constraints. The solution required calculating the total number of problems available, determining how many contests could be formed, and then limiting this by the number of days available.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Input Handling:** The official solution uses a straightforward approach to read input directly from standard input using `input()`. This is typical in competitive programming and ensures that the solution is efficient and concise.\n\n2. **Calculation of Contests:** The solution calculates the total number of problems and then determines the maximum number of contests by dividing the total problems by `K`. This is a direct and efficient way to determine how many full contests can be formed.\n\n3. **Limiting by Days:** The use of `min(P, D)` ensures that the number of contests does not exceed the number of days available, which is a crucial constraint in the problem.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions to handle input and perform calculations. My initial approach was similar in logic but required adjustments in input handling to align with competitive programming standards. The key takeaway is the importance of efficient input/output handling and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement. This experience reinforces the need to carefully manage input and output in a competitive programming context and to ensure that the logic correctly implements all constraints.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: max_contests]\nThe function reads input data for multiple test cases, where each test case includes the number of problems available each day, the number of problems required per contest, and the number of days available. It calculates the total number of problems available for each test case and determines the maximum number of contests that can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest. The function then limits the number of contests to the number of available days and stores the result for each test case. Finally, it prints the maximum number of contests that can be held for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to allocate resources (in this case, problems) to events (contests) under certain constraints, such as a limited number of days or a minimum requirement of resources per event. It can be applied in project management, scheduling, and operations research where you need to maximize the number of events or tasks that can be completed given limited resources and time. This problem also illustrates the use of basic arithmetic operations and the min function to determine the maximum feasible number of events, which is a common pattern in optimization problems."
