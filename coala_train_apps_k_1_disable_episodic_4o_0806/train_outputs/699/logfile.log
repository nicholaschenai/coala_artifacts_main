## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----

- $N = 1$
- $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

1 10 3
23

19 2
3 3 300
1 1 1

-----Sample Output:-----
0
2
7
4
1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan contests for the next `D` days, but he can host at most one contest per day. The task is to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host given these constraints.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.
2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.
3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.
4. **Output the Result**: For each test case, output the maximum number of contests that can be hosted.

### Pseudocode

```
for each test case:
    read N, K, D
    read the list of problems created by each setter
    total_problems = sum of all problems
    max_contests = total_problems // K
    result = min(max_contests, D)
    print result
```

### Python Solution

```python
def max_division_3_contests():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        D = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        problems = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        total_problems = sum(problems)
        max_contests = total_problems // K
        results.append(min(max_contests, D))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, we extract the number of setters `N`, the number of problems needed per contest `K`, and the number of days `D`.
- **Calculate Total Problems**: We sum up the problems from all setters.
- **Determine Maximum Contests**: We calculate how many contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by `K`.
- **Limit by Days**: We take the minimum of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days `D`.
- **Output**: We store the result for each test case and print them at the end.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (40 points):
- $N = 1$
- $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

1 5 31

1 10 3
23
2 5 7
20 36
2 5 10
19 2
3 3 300
1 1 1

-----Sample Output:-----
0
2
7
4
1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Given `N` setters, each with a certain number of problems, Chef wants to know the maximum number of contests he can host over `D` days, with the constraint that only one contest can be hosted per day.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate Total Problems:** Sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.
2. **Determine Maximum Contests:** Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.
3. **Limit by Days:** The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.

### Pseudocode

```
function max_contests(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        total_problems = sum(A)
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        print max_contests
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(T):
        N, K, D = test_cases[i][0]
        A = test_cases[i][1]
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 5
# test_cases = [
#     ((1, 5, 31), [4]),
#     ((1, 10, 3), [23]),
#     ((2, 5, 7), [20, 36]),
#     ((2, 5, 10), [19, 2]),
#     ((3, 3, 300), [1, 1, 1])
# ]
# max_contests(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases, processes each test case to calculate the total number of problems, determines how many contests can be formed, and then limits this by the number of days available. The results are printed for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The problem with the current solution is that it does not handle input and output correctly for competitive programming environments. The function `max_contests` is defined but never called, and the input is not read from standard input. In competitive programming, the input is typically read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Read Input from Standard Input:** Use `input()` to read the number of test cases and the details for each test case.
2. **Call the Function:** Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
3. **Output Results:** Print the results directly after processing each test case.

### Revised Solution

```python
def max_contests():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        D = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute
max_contests()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Reading Input:** The input is read all at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings for easier processing.
- **Index Management:** An index is used to track the current position in the input data list.
- **Function Execution:** The function `max_contests` is called at the end to ensure it runs and processes the input.
- **Output:** Results are collected in a list and printed after processing all test cases. This ensures that the output is in the correct format and order.

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

1 10 3

3 3 300
1 1 1

-----Sample Output:-----
0
2
7
4
1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Given `N` setters, each with a certain number of problems, Chef wants to know the maximum number of contests he can host over `D` days, with the constraint that only one contest can be hosted per day.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate Total Problems:** Sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.
2. **Determine Maximum Contests:** Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.
3. **Limit by Days:** The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.

### Pseudocode

```
function max_contests(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        total_problems = sum(A)
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        print max_contests
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(T):
        N, K, D = test_cases[i][0]
        A = test_cases[i][1]
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 5
# test_cases = [
#     ((1, 5, 31), [4]),
#     ((1, 10, 3), [23]),
#     ((2, 5, 7), [20, 36]),
#     ((2, 5, 10), [19, 2]),
#     ((3, 3, 300), [1, 1, 1])
# ]
# max_contests(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases, processes each test case to calculate the total number of problems, determines how many contests can be formed, and then limits this by the number of days available. The results are printed for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The problem with the current solution is that it does not handle input and output correctly for competitive programming environments. The function `max_contests` is defined but never called, and the input is not read from standard input. In competitive programming, the input is typically read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Read Input from Standard Input:** Use `input()` to read the number of test cases and the details for each test case.
2. **Call the Function:** Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
3. **Output Results:** Print the results directly after processing each test case.

### Revised Solution

```python
def max_contests():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        D = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute
max_contests()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Reading Input:** The input is read all at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings for easier processing.
- **Index Management:** An index is used to track the current position in the input data list.
- **Function Execution:** The function `max_contests` is called at the end to ensure it runs and processes the input.
- **Output:** Results are collected in a list and printed after processing all test cases. This ensures that the output is in the correct format and order.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that Chef can host given a set of constraints. The core concept involved calculating the total number of problems available and determining how many full contests could be formed, while also considering the limitation of the number of days available.

Initially, the solution failed because it did not handle input and output correctly for a competitive programming environment. The function was defined but not called, and input was not read from standard input. The key takeaway was the importance of correctly managing input and output, especially in environments where the input is provided all at once and needs to be processed in a structured manner.

The successful strategy involved reading all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, splitting it into manageable parts, and using an index to track the current position in the input data. This approach ensured that all test cases were processed correctly, and results were printed in the required format. This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the input/output requirements and constraints in competitive programming problems.

#     ((3, 3, 300), [1, 1, 1])
# ]
# max_contests(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases, processes each test case to calculate the total number of problems, determines how many contests can be formed, and then limits this by the number of days available. The results are printed for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The problem with the current solution is that it does not handle input and output correctly for competitive programming environments. The function `max_contests` is defined but never called, and the input is not read from standard input. In competitive programming, the input is typically read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Read Input from Standard Input:** Use `input()` to read the number of test cases and the details for each test case.
2. **Call the Function:** Ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.
3. **Output Results:** Print the results directly after processing each test case.

### Revised Solution

```python
def max_contests():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        D = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        # Calculate the total number of problems available
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        
        # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute
max_contests()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Reading Input:** The input is read all at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings for easier processing.
- **Index Management:** An index is used to track the current position in the input data list.
- **Function Execution:** The function `max_contests` is called at the end to ensure it runs and processes the input.
- **Output:** Results are collected in a list and printed after processing all test cases. This ensures that the output is in the correct format and order.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for T in range(int (eval(input()))):
 N,K,D=list(map(int,input().split()))
 A=list(map(int,input().split()))
 P=sum(A)//K 
 print(min(P,D))


INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that Chef can host given a set of constraints. The solution required calculating the total number of problems available, determining how many contests could be formed, and then limiting this by the number of days available.

### Key Insights:

1. **Input Handling:** The official solution uses a straightforward approach to read input directly from standard input using `input()`. This is typical in competitive programming and ensures that the solution is efficient and concise.

2. **Calculation of Contests:** The solution calculates the total number of problems and then determines the maximum number of contests by dividing the total problems by `K`. This is a direct and efficient way to determine how many full contests can be formed.

3. **Limiting by Days:** The use of `min(P, D)` ensures that the number of contests does not exceed the number of days available, which is a crucial constraint in the problem.

### Reflection:

The official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions to handle input and perform calculations. My initial approach was similar in logic but required adjustments in input handling to align with competitive programming standards. The key takeaway is the importance of efficient input/output handling and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement. This experience reinforces the need to carefully manage input and output in a competitive programming context and to ensure that the logic correctly implements all constraints.

[Problem]
    Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
    A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
    Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
    - The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
    - $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
    - $1 \le D \le 10^9$
    - $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (40 points):
    - $N = 1$
    - $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
    Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    5
    1 5 31
    4
    1 10 3
    23
    2 5 7
    20 36
    2 5 10
    19 2
    3 3 300
    1 1 1

    -----Sample Output:-----
    0
    2
    7
    4
    1

    -----Explanation:-----
    - 
    Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
    - 
    Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
    - 
    Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.
