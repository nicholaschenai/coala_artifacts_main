Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \\leq i \\leq N$.    \nA Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.\nGiven these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.\n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$ respectively. \n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^2$\n- $1 \\le K \\le 10^9$ \n- $1 \\le D \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le A_i \\le 10^7$ for each valid $i$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (40 points):\n- $N = 1$\n- $1 \\le A_1 \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n5\n1 5 31\n4\n1 10 3\n23\n2 5 7\n20 36\n2 5 10\n19 2\n3 3 300\n1 1 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n0\n2\n7\n4\n1\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- \nExample case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.\n- \nExample case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.\n- \nExample case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan contests for the next `D` days, but he can host at most one contest per day. The task is to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host given these constraints.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.\n2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.\n3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.\n4. **Output the Result**: For each test case, output the maximum number of contests that can be hosted.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfor each test case:\n    read N, K, D\n    read the list of problems created by each setter\n    total_problems = sum of all problems\n    max_contests = total_problems // K\n    result = min(max_contests, D)\n    print result\n```\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_division_3_contests():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        D = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        problems = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        \n        total_problems = sum(problems)\n        max_contests = total_problems // K\n        results.append(min(max_contests, D))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, we extract the number of setters `N`, the number of problems needed per contest `K`, and the number of days `D`.\n- **Calculate Total Problems**: We sum up the problems from all setters.\n- **Determine Maximum Contests**: We calculate how many contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by `K`.\n- **Limit by Days**: We take the minimum of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days `D`.\n- **Output**: We store the result for each test case and print them at the end."

The solution required calculating the total number of problems available, determining how many contests could be formed, and then limiting this by the number of days available.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Input Handling:** The official solution uses a straightforward approach to read input directly from standard input using `input()`. This is typical in competitive programming and ensures that the solution is efficient and concise.\n\n2. **Calculation of Contests:** The solution calculates the total number of problems and then determines the maximum number of contests by dividing the total problems by `K`. This is a direct and efficient way to determine how many full contests can be formed.\n\n3. **Limiting by Days:** The use of `min(P, D)` ensures that the number of contests does not exceed the number of days available, which is a crucial constraint in the problem.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions to handle input and perform calculations. My initial approach was similar in logic but required adjustments in input handling to align with competitive programming standards. The key takeaway is the importance of efficient input/output handling and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement. This experience reinforces the need to carefully manage input and output in a competitive programming context and to ensure that the logic correctly implements all constraints."

It calculates the total number of problems available for each test case and determines the maximum number of contests that can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest. The function then limits the number of contests to the number of available days and stores the result for each test case. Finally, it prints the maximum number of contests that can be held for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to allocate resources (in this case, problems) to events (contests) under certain constraints, such as a limited number of days or a minimum requirement of resources per event. It can be applied in project management, scheduling, and operations research where you need to maximize the number of events or tasks that can be completed given limited resources and time. This problem also illustrates the use of basic arithmetic operations and the min function to determine the maximum feasible number of events, which is a common pattern in optimization problems."
