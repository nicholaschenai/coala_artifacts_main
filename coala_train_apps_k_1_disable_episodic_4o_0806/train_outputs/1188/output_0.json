    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to identify all members of a mafia organization who are considered \"minor criminals.\" These are the members who do not have anyone reporting to them. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom a particular member reports. The Don, who is the head of the organization, reports to no one and is represented by a 0 in the list. Our task is to find and list all members who have no subordinates.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to determine which members have subordinates. We can do this by creating a set of all members who are reported to by others.\n   - Then, we iterate through all members and check if they are not in the set of members who have subordinates. If a member is not in this set, they are a \"minor criminal.\"\n   - Finally, we collect all such members and output their indices in ascending order.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Input: N (number of members), R (list of reporting relationships)\n   Initialize an empty set called 'reported_to'\n   For each member i from 1 to N:\n       If R[i-1] is not 0:\n           Add R[i-1] to 'reported_to'\n   Initialize an empty list called 'minor_criminals'\n   For each member i from 1 to N:\n       If i is not in 'reported_to':\n           Add i to 'minor_criminals'\n   Sort 'minor_criminals'\n   Output 'minor_criminals' as a space-separated string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_minor_criminals(N, R):\n    # Step 1: Create a set to track members who are reported to\n    reported_to = set()\n    \n    # Step 2: Populate the set with members who are reported to\n    for i in range(N):\n        if R[i] != 0:  # Ignore the Don who reports to no one\n            reported_to.add(R[i])\n    \n    # Step 3: Identify minor criminals (members not in the reported_to set)\n    minor_criminals = []\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if i not in reported_to:\n            minor_criminals.append(i)\n    \n    # Step 4: Sort the list of minor criminals\n    minor_criminals.sort()\n    \n    # Step 5: Print the result as a space-separated string\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, minor_criminals)))\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nN = int(data[0])\nR = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n\n# Call the function to find and print minor criminals\nfind_minor_criminals(N, R)\n```\n\nThis solution reads the input, processes the reporting relationships to identify members with no subordinates, and outputs their indices in ascending order.",
