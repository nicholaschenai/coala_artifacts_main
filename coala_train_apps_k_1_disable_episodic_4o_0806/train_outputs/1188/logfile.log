## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a mafia organization with a hierarchical structure. Each member reports to exactly one other member, except for the Don, who reports to no one. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom a particular member reports. Our task is to identify all the "minor criminals," which are members that no one reports to. These members are potential killers. We need to output their indices in ascending order.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Don**: The Don is the only member who reports to no one, indicated by a 0 in the list.
2. **Track Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.
3. **Identify Minor Criminals**: A minor criminal is a member who is not in the set of reported members.
4. **Output**: Collect all such minor criminals and output their indices in ascending order.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the integer `N` (number of members).
2. Read the list `R` of size `N` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom member `i+1` reports.
3. Initialize an empty set `reported_to`.
4. Iterate over each `Ri` in `R`:
   - If `Ri` is not 0, add `Ri` to the `reported_to` set.
5. Initialize an empty list `minor_criminals`.
6. Iterate over indices from 1 to `N`:
   - If the index is not in `reported_to`, add it to `minor_criminals`.
7. Sort `minor_criminals`.
8. Print the sorted list of `minor_criminals`.

### Python Code

```python
def find_potential_killers():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    # Set to track members who are reported to
    reported_to = set()
    
    # Fill the set with members who are reported to
    for Ri in R:
        if Ri != 0:
            reported_to.add(Ri)
    
    # List to store potential killers (minor criminals)
    minor_criminals = []
    
    # Check each member if they are not reported to
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to:
            minor_criminals.append(i)
    
    # Sort the list of minor criminals
    minor_criminals.sort()
    
    # Print the result
    print(" ".join(map(str, minor_criminals)))

```

This code reads input, processes the reporting structure to identify members who are not reported to by anyone, and outputs their indices in ascending order.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to identify all members of a mafia organization who are considered "minor criminals." These are the members who do not have anyone reporting to them. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom a particular member reports. The Don, who is the head of the organization, reports to no one and is represented by a 0 in the list. Our task is to find and list all members who have no subordinates.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, we need to determine which members have subordinates. We can do this by creating a set of all members who are reported to by others.
   - Then, we iterate through all members and check if they are not in the set of members who have subordinates. If a member is not in this set, they are a "minor criminal."
   - Finally, we collect all such members and output their indices in ascending order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Input: N (number of members), R (list of reporting relationships)
   Initialize an empty set called 'reported_to'
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If R[i-1] is not 0:
           Add R[i-1] to 'reported_to'
   Initialize an empty list called 'minor_criminals'
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If i is not in 'reported_to':
           Add i to 'minor_criminals'
   Sort 'minor_criminals'
   Output 'minor_criminals' as a space-separated string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_minor_criminals(N, R):
    # Step 1: Create a set to track members who are reported to
    reported_to = set()
    
    # Step 2: Populate the set with members who are reported to
    for i in range(N):
        if R[i] != 0:  # Ignore the Don who reports to no one
            reported_to.add(R[i])
    
    # Step 3: Identify minor criminals (members not in the reported_to set)
    minor_criminals = []
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to:

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to identify "minor criminals" in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. The key concept was to determine which members do not have any subordinates, as these are the potential killers. The problem was essentially about processing a tree-like structure where each node (member) reports to exactly one parent (another member), except for the root (the Don).

The strategy that worked involved using a set to track all members who are reported to by others. By iterating through the list of reporting relationships, we could populate this set. Then, by checking which members are not in this set, we could identify the minor criminals. This approach efficiently handled the constraints, especially with the potential size of the input (up to 100,000 members).

The solution was straightforward and involved basic set operations and list processing. The use of a set was crucial for efficient membership checking, which is a common pattern when dealing with problems that require identifying unique or missing elements in a collection. The final output was sorted to meet the problem's requirements, ensuring the indices were presented in ascending order. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding tree structures and using sets for efficient data processing.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to identify all members of a mafia organization who are considered "minor criminals." These are the members who do not have anyone reporting to them. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom a particular member reports. The Don, who is the head of the organization, reports to no one and is represented by a 0 in the list. Our task is to find and list all members who have no subordinates.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, we need to determine which members have subordinates. We can do this by creating a set of all members who are reported to by others.
   - Then, we iterate through all members and check if they are not in the set of members who have subordinates. If a member is not in this set, they are a "minor criminal."
   - Finally, we collect all such members and output their indices in ascending order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Input: N (number of members), R (list of reporting relationships)
   Initialize an empty set called 'reported_to'
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If R[i-1] is not 0:
           Add R[i-1] to 'reported_to'
   Initialize an empty list called 'minor_criminals'
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If i is not in 'reported_to':
           Add i to 'minor_criminals'
   Sort 'minor_criminals'
   Output 'minor_criminals' as a space-separated string
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution was effective in identifying the minor criminals by leveraging a set to track which members are reported to. This approach efficiently determines which members have no subordinates, as required by the problem statement.

The official solution takes a slightly different approach by constructing a dictionary to represent the reporting structure as a tree. Each member is a key in the dictionary, and the value is a list of members who report to them. This method is insightful as it directly models the hierarchical structure of the mafia organization. The solution then identifies minor criminals by checking which members have an empty list of subordinates in the dictionary.

Key insights from the official solution:
- Using a dictionary to model relationships can be a powerful way to represent hierarchical data structures.
- The dictionary approach allows for easy identification of members with no subordinates by simply checking for empty lists.

Both solutions are efficient, but the dictionary-based approach provides a clear representation of the hierarchy, which could be beneficial for more complex problems involving tree structures.
