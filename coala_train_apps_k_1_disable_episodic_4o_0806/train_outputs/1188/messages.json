He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.\nChef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.\nThere are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.\nNow, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains one integer N.\nNext line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri \u2014 the person whom the ith member reports to.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a list of space-separated integers in ascending order \u2014 the indices of potential killers.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 Ri \u2264 N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.\n- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask #1 [50 points]: N \u2264 10000\n- Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n6\n0 1 1 2 2 3\n\nOutput:\n4 5 6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe reporting structure:\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom a particular member reports. Our task is to identify all the \"minor criminals,\" which are members that no one reports to. These members are potential killers. We need to output their indices in ascending order.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Don**: The Don is the only member who reports to no one, indicated by a 0 in the list.\n2. **Track Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.\n3. **Identify Minor Criminals**: A minor criminal is a member who is not in the set of reported members.\n4. **Output**: Collect all such minor criminals and output their indices in ascending order.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the integer `N` (number of members).\n2. Read the list `R` of size `N` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom member `i+1` reports.\n3. Initialize an empty set `reported_to`.\n4. Iterate over each `Ri` in `R`:\n   - If `Ri` is not 0, add `Ri` to the `reported_to` set.\n5. Initialize an empty list `minor_criminals`.\n6. Iterate over indices from 1 to `N`:\n   - If the index is not in `reported_to`, add it to `minor_criminals`.\n7. Sort `minor_criminals`.\n8. Print the sorted list of `minor_criminals`.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n    \n    # Set to track members who are reported to\n    reported_to = set()\n    \n    # Fill the set with members who are reported to\n    for Ri in R:\n        if Ri != 0:\n            reported_to.add(Ri)\n    \n    # List to store potential killers (minor criminals)\n    minor_criminals = []\n    \n    # Check each member if they are not reported to\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if i not in reported_to:\n            minor_criminals.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the list of minor criminals\n    minor_criminals.sort()\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, minor_criminals)))\n\n```\n\nThis code reads input, processes the reporting structure to identify members who are not reported to by anyone, and outputs their indices in ascending order."

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The key concept was to determine which members do not have any subordinates, as these are the potential killers. The problem was essentially about processing a tree-like structure where each node (member) reports to exactly one parent (another member), except for the root (the Don).\n\nThe strategy that worked involved using a set to track all members who are reported to by others. By iterating through the list of reporting relationships, we could populate this set. Then, by checking which members are not in this set, we could identify the minor criminals. This approach efficiently handled the constraints, especially with the potential size of the input (up to 100,000 members).\n\nThe solution was straightforward and involved basic set operations and list processing. The use of a set was crucial for efficient membership checking, which is a common pattern when dealing with problems that require identifying unique or missing elements in a collection. The final output was sorted to meet the problem's requirements, ensuring the indices were presented in ascending order. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding tree structures and using sets for efficient data processing."

This approach efficiently determines which members have no subordinates, as required by the problem statement.\n\nThe official solution takes a slightly different approach by constructing a dictionary to represent the reporting structure as a tree. Each member is a key in the dictionary, and the value is a list of members who report to them. This method is insightful as it directly models the hierarchical structure of the mafia organization. The solution then identifies minor criminals by checking which members have an empty list of subordinates in the dictionary.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n- Using a dictionary to model relationships can be a powerful way to represent hierarchical data structures.\n- The dictionary approach allows for easy identification of members with no subordinates by simply checking for empty lists.\n\nBoth solutions are efficient, but the dictionary-based approach provides a clear representation of the hierarchy, which could be beneficial for more complex problems involving tree structures."

This is common in organizational structures, project management, and even in family trees where one might want to find individuals who do not have descendants. The problem-solving approach of using a set to track dependencies and then identifying elements not in this set is a general technique that can be applied to any acyclic graph or tree structure to find leaf nodes or independent elements. This is particularly useful in computer science for tasks such as garbage collection, dependency resolution, and network analysis."
