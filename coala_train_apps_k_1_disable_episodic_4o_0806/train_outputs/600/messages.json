For each test case, we are given an integer \\( N \\), which represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to consider. The task is to determine the last remaining number after performing the described process.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \\( F_0 = 0 \\), \\( F_1 = 1 \\), and \\( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Last Decimal Digit**: For each Fibonacci number, we are interested in its last decimal digit, which is the number modulo 10.\n\n3. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly remove all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last decimal digits until only one element remains.\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition**: The sequence of last decimal digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.\n\n5. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the periodicity, for any \\( N \\), we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers to determine the sequence of last digits. We can then simulate the reduction process on this sequence.\n\n6. **Reduction Process**: For a sequence of length \\( l \\), the new sequence \\( E \\) is formed by taking every second element starting from the second element. This process is repeated until the sequence has only one element.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Precompute the last decimal digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.\n2.

This approach can be applied to other problems involving periodic sequences or when a problem can be reduced to a smaller equivalent problem using modular arithmetic.
