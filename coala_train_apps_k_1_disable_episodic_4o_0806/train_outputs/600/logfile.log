## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of Fibonacci numbers and need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of their last decimal digits. For each test case, we are given an integer \( N \), which represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to consider. The task is to determine the last remaining number after performing the described process.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

2. **Last Decimal Digit**: For each Fibonacci number, we are interested in its last decimal digit, which is the number modulo 10.

3. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly remove all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last decimal digits until only one element remains.

4. **Pattern Recognition**: The sequence of last decimal digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

5. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the periodicity, for any \( N \), we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers to determine the sequence of last digits. We can then simulate the reduction process on this sequence.

6. **Reduction Process**: For a sequence of length \( l \), the new sequence \( E \) is formed by taking every second element starting from the second element. This process is repeated until the sequence has only one element.

## Pseudocode

1. Precompute the last decimal digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. For each test case:
   - Determine the effective length \( N \% 60 \) to use the precomputed sequence.
   - Simulate the reduction process on the sequence of last digits until one element remains.
   - Output the last remaining element.

## Python Solution

```python
def last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(T, test_cases):
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    
    results = []
    for N in test_cases:
        # Find the effective length using the periodicity of 60
        effective_length = N % 60
        if effective_length == 0:
            effective_length = 60
        
        # Start with the sequence of last digits up to the effective length
        D = last_digits[:effective_length]
        
        # Reduce the sequence until one element remains
        while len(D) > 1:
            D = D[1::2]  # Take every second element starting from the second
        
        # The last remaining element
        results.append(D[0])
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# T = number of test cases
# test_cases = list of N values for each test case
# results = last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(T, test_cases)
# for result in results:
#     print(result)
```

This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, allowing us to reduce the problem size significantly and perform the reduction process quickly.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The core concept here was recognizing that the multiples of 10 form an arithmetic sequence, which allowed us to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to efficiently compute the result.

    Key steps included:
    - Identifying the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to "N".
    - Calculating the number of such multiples.
    - Using the arithmetic series sum formula: \( \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{number of terms} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})}{2} \).

    The solution was implemented in Python, reading input from standard input and outputting results for each test case. The approach was efficient, leveraging integer division and arithmetic properties to handle large values of "N" up to 1 billion without performance issues.

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sequences and using mathematical formulas to simplify calculations, especially when dealing with large input sizes.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of Fibonacci numbers and need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. This process is repeated until only one number remains. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence Modulo 10**: The Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeats every 60 numbers.

2. **Reduce the Problem Size**: Given the periodicity, for any N, we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. The sequence of last digits will repeat, so we can reduce N modulo 60 to find the relevant sequence.

3. **Simulate the Process**: For the reduced sequence, simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

4. **Handle Multiple Test Cases Efficiently**: Precompute the result for all possible values of N modulo 60, and use this precomputed result to answer each test case in constant time.

## Pseudocode

1. Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. For each possible length of sequence (1 to 60), simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one element remains.
3. Store the result for each length in a lookup table.
4. For each test case:
   - Compute `N % 60`.
   - Use the lookup table to find the result for this reduced length.

## Python Solution

def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):

4. **Handle Multiple Test Cases Efficiently**: Precompute the result for all possible values of N modulo 60, and use this precomputed result to answer each test case in constant time.

## Pseudocode

1. Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. For each possible length of sequence (1 to 60), simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one element remains.
3. Store the result for each length in a lookup table.
4. For each test case:
   - Compute `N % 60`.
   - Use the lookup table to find the result for this reduced length.

## Python Solution

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each possible length of sequence (1 to 60)
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = sequence[1::2]  # Keep only even-indexed elements
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_fibonacci_problem(T, test_cases):
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    output = []
    for N in test_cases:
        reduced_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[reduced_length - 1])  # -1 because results is 0-indexed
    return output

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

# Solve the problem
output = solve_fibonacci_problem(T, test_cases)

# Print the results
for result in output:
    print(result)
```

This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and precomputing results for all possible sequence lengths up to 60. This allows each test case to be resolved in constant time.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] In this problem, the key insight was recognizing the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10, which repeats every 60 numbers. This allowed us to reduce the problem size significantly by only considering the first 60 Fibonacci numbers for any given N. 

The strategy involved precomputing the last digits of these 60 Fibonacci numbers and then simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements for each possible sequence length from 1 to 60. This precomputation step enabled us to store the results in a lookup table, allowing each test case to be resolved in constant time by simply using the precomputed results.

The solution was efficient due to the use of modular arithmetic to reduce N to a manageable size and the precomputation of results, which is a common technique in problems involving periodic sequences. This approach ensured that even with the maximum constraints, the solution remained performant. 

Overall, this problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns and periodicity in sequences, and how precomputation can be leveraged to handle large input sizes efficiently.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of Fibonacci numbers and need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. This process is repeated until only one number remains. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence Modulo 10**: The Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeats every 60 numbers.

2. **Reduce the Problem Size**: Given the periodicity, for any N, we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. The sequence of last digits will repeat, so we can reduce N modulo 60 to find the relevant sequence.

3. **Simulate the Process**: For the reduced sequence, simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

4. **Handle Multiple Test Cases Efficiently**: Precompute the result for all possible values of N modulo 60, and use this precomputed result to answer each test case in constant time.

## Pseudocode

1. Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. For each possible length of sequence (1 to 60), simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one element remains.
3. Store the result for each length in a lookup table.
4. For each test case:
   - Compute `N % 60`.
   - Use the lookup table to find the result for this reduced length.

## Python Solution

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each possible length of sequence (1 to 60)
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = sequence[1::2]  # Keep only even-indexed elements
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_fibonacci_problem(T, test_cases):
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    output = []
    for N in test_cases:
        reduced_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[reduced_length - 1])  # -1 because results is 0-indexed
    return output

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

# Solve the problem
output = solve_fibonacci_problem(T, test_cases)

# Print the results
for result in output:

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] The problem of finding the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers was insightful due to its reliance on the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10. The key insight is that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeats every 60 numbers, which allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.

### Key Insights:

1. **Periodicity of Fibonacci Modulo 10**: The Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 has a cycle length of 60. This means that for any large N, we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers to determine the sequence of last digits.

2. **Efficient Reduction**: By reducing N modulo 60, we can determine the relevant sequence of last digits without computing all Fibonacci numbers up to N. This drastically reduces the computational complexity.

3. **Binary Representation for Efficient Indexing**: The official solution uses the binary representation of N to determine the largest power of 2 less than or equal to N, which helps in efficiently finding the index in the precomputed sequence.

### Comparison with My Approach:

- **Precomputation**: Both my approach and the official solution precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers. However, the official solution directly uses the binary representation to find the largest power of 2, which is a clever way to determine the index in the sequence.

- **Efficiency**: The official solution is more concise and leverages mathematical properties (binary representation and powers of 2) to achieve the same result with potentially less computational overhead.

### Conclusion:

The problem highlights the importance of recognizing patterns and periodicity in sequences, which can lead to significant optimizations. The use of binary representation to efficiently determine indices is a technique that can be applied to other problems involving powers of 2 or similar structures. This experience reinforces the value of mathematical insights in algorithm design.
