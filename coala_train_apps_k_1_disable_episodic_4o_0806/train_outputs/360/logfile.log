## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4

Example 3:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. We need to ship all these packages within a given number of days, `D`. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded on any day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to find the minimum possible weight capacity of the ship that allows us to ship all packages within `D` days.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - The minimum possible capacity of the ship must be at least the weight of the heaviest package, because we cannot split packages.
   - The maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights, which would allow us to ship all packages in one day.
   - We can use a binary search to find the minimum capacity between these two extremes.
   - For each capacity value in our binary search, we simulate the shipping process to check if it's possible to ship all packages within `D` days.
   - If a capacity allows shipping within `D` days, we try a smaller capacity; otherwise, we increase the capacity.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function canShip(weights, D, capacity):
       Initialize days to 1
       Initialize current_weight to 0
       For each weight in weights:
           If current_weight + weight > capacity:
               Increment days
               Set current_weight to 0
           Add weight to current_weight
       Return whether days <= D

   Define function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
       Set left to max(weights)
       Set right to sum(weights)
       While left < right:
           Set mid to (left + right) // 2
           If canShip(weights, D, mid):
               Set right to mid
           Else:
               Set left to mid + 1
       Return left
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    # Helper function to determine if we can ship within D days with given capacity
    def canShip(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:
        days = 1  # Start with the first day
        current_weight = 0  # Current weight on the ship for the current day
        
        for weight in weights:
            # If adding this package exceeds capacity, we need a new day
            if current_weight + weight > capacity:
                days += 1  # Increment the day count
                current_weight = 0  # Reset current weight for the new day
            
            current_weight += weight  # Add the package to the current day's load
        
        # Check if the number of days used is within the allowed days
        return days <= D

    # Main function to find the minimum ship capacity to ship within D days
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        left = max(weights)  # Minimum capacity must be at least the heaviest package
        right = sum(weights)  # Maximum capacity is the sum of all weights
        
        # Binary search for the minimum capacity
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2  # Midpoint of current capacity range
            
            # Check if we can ship with this capacity
            if self.canShip(weights, D, mid):
                right = mid  # Try a smaller capacity
            else:
                left = mid + 1  # Increase capacity
        
        return left  # The minimum capacity that works
```

This solution uses a binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity needed to ship all packages within the given number of days. The `canShip` helper function checks if a given capacity is sufficient to meet the requirement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that Chef can host given a set of constraints. The solution required calculating the total number of problems available, determining how many contests could be formed, and then limiting this by the number of days available.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Input Handling:** The official solution uses a straightforward approach to read input directly from standard input using `input()`. This is typical in competitive programming and ensures that the solution is efficient and concise.

    2. **Calculation of Contests:** The solution calculates the total number of problems and then determines the maximum number of contests by dividing the total problems by `K`. This is a direct and efficient way to determine how many full contests can be formed.

    3. **Limiting by Days:** The use of `min(P, D)` ensures that the number of contests does not exceed the number of days available, which is a crucial constraint in the problem.

    ### Reflection:

    The official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions to handle input and perform calculations. My initial approach was similar in logic but required adjustments in input handling to align with competitive programming standards. The key takeaway is the importance of efficient input/output handling and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement. This experience reinforces the need to carefully manage input and output in a competitive programming context and to ensure that the logic correctly implements all constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. These packages need to be shipped from one port to another within a given number of days, D. The packages must be loaded onto a ship in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, and the ship has a maximum weight capacity that cannot be exceeded. Our task is to determine the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows all packages to be shipped within the specified number of days.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Constraints**: 
   - The ship must carry packages in the order they appear.
   - The ship's capacity must be enough to ship all packages within D days.

2. **Determine the Range for Capacity**:
   - The minimum possible capacity is the weight of the heaviest package (since the ship must at least carry the heaviest package).
   - The maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights (if we ship all packages in one day).

3. **Binary Search for Optimal Capacity**:
   - Use binary search to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within D days.
   - For each capacity in the search, simulate the shipping process to check if it can be done within D days.

4. **Simulation of Shipping**:
   - Start with the first package and keep adding packages to the current day's load until adding another package would exceed the current capacity.
   - If the current day's load is full, move to the next day.
   - Count the number of days used and check if it exceeds D.

## Pseudocode

```
function canShip(weights, D, capacity):
    days = 1
    currentLoad = 0
    for weight in weights:
        if currentLoad + weight > capacity:
            days += 1
            currentLoad = 0
        currentLoad += weight
    return days <= D

function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
    left = max(weights)
    right = sum(weights)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canShip(weights, D, mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```

            else:
                left = mid + 1  # Increase capacity
        return left  # The minimum capacity that works
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **canShip Function**: This helper function checks if it's possible to ship all packages within D days given a specific ship capacity. It iterates through the weights, simulating the loading process, and counts the number of days required.

- **shipWithinDays Function**: This function uses binary search to find the minimum ship capacity that allows all packages to be shipped within D days. It adjusts the search range based on whether the current capacity can ship the packages within the given days.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6

INFO - [Task id] 360 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. These packages need to be shipped from one port to another within a given number of days, D. The packages must be loaded onto a ship in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, and the ship has a maximum weight capacity that cannot be exceeded. Our task is to determine the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows all packages to be shipped within the specified number of days.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Constraints**: 
   - The ship must carry packages in the order they appear.
   - The ship's capacity must be enough to ship all packages within D days.

2. **Determine the Range for Capacity**:
   - The minimum possible capacity is the weight of the heaviest package (since the ship must at least carry the heaviest package).
   - The maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights (if we ship all packages in one day).

3. **Binary Search for Optimal Capacity**:
   - Use binary search to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within D days.
   - For each capacity in the search, simulate the shipping process to check if it can be done within D days.

4. **Simulation of Shipping**:
   - Start with the first package and keep adding packages to the current day's load until adding another package would exceed the current capacity.
   - If the current day's load is full, move to the next day.
   - Count the number of days used and check if it exceeds D.

## Pseudocode

```
function canShip(weights, D, capacity):
    days = 1
    currentLoad = 0
    for weight in weights:
        if currentLoad + weight > capacity:
            days += 1
            currentLoad = 0
        currentLoad += weight
    return days <= D

function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
    left = max(weights)
    right = sum(weights)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canShip(weights, D, mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def canShip(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:
        days = 1
        currentLoad = 0
        for weight in weights:
            if currentLoad + weight > capacity:
                days += 1
                currentLoad = 0
            currentLoad += weight
        return days <= D

    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        left = max(weights)  # Minimum capacity must be at least the heaviest package
        right = sum(weights)  # Maximum capacity is the sum of all weights
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if self.canShip(weights, D, mid):
                right = mid  # Try a smaller capacity
            else:
                left = mid + 1  # Increase capacity
        return left  # The minimum capacity that works
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **canShip Function**: This helper function checks if it's possible to ship all packages within D days given a specific ship capacity. It iterates through the weights, simulating the loading process, and counts the number of days required.

- **shipWithinDays Function**: This function uses binary search to find the minimum ship capacity that allows all packages to be shipped within D days. It adjusts the search range based on whether the current capacity can ship the packages within the given days.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum ship capacity required to transport packages within a specified number of days, adhering to the order of packages. The core concept involved using a binary search strategy to efficiently find this minimum capacity. The problem tested understanding of binary search and simulation of constraints.

The key insight was recognizing that the minimum capacity must be at least the weight of the heaviest package, and the maximum capacity could be the sum of all package weights. This defined the search space for the binary search. The binary search was used to iteratively narrow down the potential capacities by simulating the shipping process with a helper function `canShip`, which checked if a given capacity could ship all packages within the allowed days.

The solution was straightforward once the binary search approach was identified. The helper function `canShip` was crucial for simulating the shipping process and determining if a given capacity was feasible. This approach efficiently reduced the problem's complexity from a potential brute-force solution to a more optimal one.

Overall, this problem reinforced the utility of binary search in optimization problems where a decision can be made based on a threshold value, and it highlighted the importance of simulating constraints to validate potential solutions.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] The problem of determining the minimum ship capacity to transport packages within a given number of days is a classic example of using binary search to optimize a solution. Here are some key insights and reflections from the problem-solving process:

### Key Insights

1. **Binary Search on Capacity**:
   - Both my solution and the official solution use binary search to find the minimum capacity. This is efficient because it reduces the problem space logarithmically, which is crucial given the constraints.

2. **Range of Capacity**:
   - My solution set the upper bound of the search range to the sum of all weights, which is a safe but potentially large upper bound.
   - The official solution optimizes this by setting the upper bound to `max(weights) * len(weights) // D`, which is a tighter bound. This is based on the idea that if we distribute the weights evenly across D days, this would be the maximum capacity needed.

3. **Simulation of Shipping**:
   - Both solutions simulate the shipping process by iterating through the weights and counting the number of days required for a given capacity. This is a straightforward approach to verify if a certain capacity is feasible.

4. **Adjusting the Search Range**:
   - In both solutions, if the current capacity results in more days than allowed, the lower bound is increased. Otherwise, the upper bound is decreased. This ensures that we converge on the minimum feasible capacity.

### Reflection

The official solution provides a more optimized upper bound for the binary search, which can lead to faster convergence in some cases. This is a valuable insight for similar problems where the search space can be intelligently reduced based on problem constraints. The core logic of simulating the shipping process remains consistent across both solutions, highlighting the importance of accurately modeling the problem constraints in the solution. Overall, the problem reinforces the utility of binary search in optimization problems and the importance of setting appropriate bounds for the search space.
