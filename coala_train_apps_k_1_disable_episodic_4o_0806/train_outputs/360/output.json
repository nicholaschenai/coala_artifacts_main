    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. These packages need to be shipped from one port to another within a given number of days, D. The packages must be loaded onto a ship in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, and the ship has a maximum weight capacity that cannot be exceeded. Our task is to determine the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows all packages to be shipped within the specified number of days.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - The ship must carry packages in the order they appear.\n   - The ship's capacity must be enough to ship all packages within D days.\n\n2. **Determine the Range for Capacity**:\n   - The minimum possible capacity is the weight of the heaviest package (since the ship must at least carry the heaviest package).\n   - The maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights (if we ship all packages in one day).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Optimal Capacity**:\n   - Use binary search to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within D days.\n   - For each capacity in the search, simulate the shipping process to check if it can be done within D days.\n\n4. **Simulation of Shipping**:\n   - Start with the first package and keep adding packages to the current day's load until adding another package would exceed the current capacity.\n   - If the current day's load is full, move to the next day.\n   - Count the number of days used and check if it exceeds D.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction canShip(weights, D, capacity):\n    days = 1\n    currentLoad = 0\n    for weight in weights:\n        if currentLoad + weight > capacity:\n            days += 1\n            currentLoad = 0\n        currentLoad += weight\n    return days <= D\n\nfunction shipWithinDays(weights, D):\n    left = max(weights)\n    right = sum(weights)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if canShip(weights, D, mid):\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    return left\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canShip(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:\n        days = 1\n        currentLoad = 0\n        for weight in weights:\n            if currentLoad + weight > capacity:\n                days += 1\n                currentLoad = 0\n            currentLoad += weight\n        return days <= D\n\n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:\n        left = max(weights)  # Minimum capacity must be at least the heaviest package\n        right = sum(weights)  # Maximum capacity is the sum of all weights\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if self.canShip(weights, D, mid):\n                right = mid  # Try a smaller capacity\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1  # Increase capacity\n        return left  # The minimum capacity that works\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **canShip Function**: This helper function checks if it's possible to ship all packages within D days given a specific ship capacity. It iterates through the weights, simulating the loading process, and counts the number of days required.\n\n- **shipWithinDays Function**: This function uses binary search to find the minimum ship capacity that allows all packages to be shipped within D days. It adjusts the search range based on whether the current capacity can ship the packages within the given days.",
