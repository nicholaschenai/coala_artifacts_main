    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. We can smash two rocks together, and the result depends on their weights. If the weights are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If they are different, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the lighter rock's weight. We repeat this process until at most one rock is left. Our goal is to find the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock, or 0 if no rocks are left.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. The idea is to partition the rocks into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. This is similar to the subset sum problem, where we try to find a subset of numbers that sum up to a target value. Here, the target is half of the total weight of all rocks. We will use a dynamic programming table to keep track of achievable sums and find the closest sum to half of the total weight. The smallest possible weight of the last stone is the difference between the total weight and twice this closest sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function lastStoneWeightII(stones):\n       total_weight = sum of all stones\n       target = total_weight // 2\n       dp = array of size (target + 1) initialized to False\n       dp[0] = True\n\n       for each stone in stones:\n           for j from target down to stone:\n               dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n\n       for j from target down to 0:\n           if dp[j] is True:\n               return total_weight - 2 * j\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Calculate the total weight of all stones\n        total_weight = sum(stones)\n        # The target is half of the total weight\n        target = total_weight // 2\n        \n        # Initialize a DP array to track achievable sums\n        dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # Base case: zero sum is always achievable\n        \n        # Update the DP array for each stone\n        for stone in stones:\n            # Traverse backwards to avoid overwriting results of the current iteration\n            for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n        \n        # Find the largest j such that dp[j] is True\n        # This represents the closest sum to half of the total weight\n        for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n            if dp[j]:\n                # The smallest possible weight of the last stone\n                return total_weight - 2 * j\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the smallest possible weight of the last stone by minimizing the difference between two groups of stones.",
