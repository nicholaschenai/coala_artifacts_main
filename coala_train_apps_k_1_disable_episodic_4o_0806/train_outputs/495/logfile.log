INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. We can repeatedly smash two rocks together. If the weights of the rocks are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If the weights are different, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. We need to determine the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock, or 0 if no rocks are left.

## Conceptual Solution

The problem is similar to a partition problem where we want to split the stones into two groups such that the difference between the sums of the two groups is minimized. This is because smashing two stones is equivalent to reducing the total weight by twice the weight of the smaller group.

1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.
2. Use dynamic programming to find the maximum possible sum of a subset of stones that does not exceed half of the total weight.
3. The smallest possible weight of the last stone is the difference between the total weight and twice this maximum subset sum.

## Pseudocode

1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.
2. Initialize a boolean DP array `dp` of size `total_weight // 2 + 1` with `dp[0] = True`.
3. For each stone weight:
   - Iterate backwards through the DP array from `total_weight // 2` to the stone weight.
   - Update `dp[j]` to `True` if `dp[j - stone]` is `True`.
4. Find the largest `j` for which `dp[j]` is `True`.
5. Return `total_weight - 2 * j`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        # Calculate the total weight of all stones
        total_weight = sum(stones)
        
        # The target is to find the maximum weight we can achieve that is <= total_weight // 2
        target = total_weight // 2
        
        # Initialize a DP array where dp[i] means whether a sum of i can be achieved
        dp = [False] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: a sum of 0 is always achievable
        
        # Process each stone
        for stone in stones:
            # Update the dp array from back to front
            for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]
        
        # Find the largest j for which dp[j] is True
        for j in range(target, -1, -1):
            if dp[j]:
                # The smallest possible weight of the last stone
                return total_weight - 2 * j
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the optimal way to partition the stones into two groups with minimal difference in their total weights. The time complexity is O(n * total_weight), where n is the number of stones.

    Part: 1/2
    \chapter{Dynamic programming}

    \index{dynamic programming}

    \key{Dynamic programming}
    is a technique that combines the correctness
    of complete search and the efficiency
    of greedy algorithms.
    Dynamic programming can be applied if the
    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems
    that can be solved independently.

    There are two uses for dynamic programming:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \key{Finding an optimal solution}:
    We want to find a solution that is
    as large as possible or as small as possible.
    \item
    \key{Counting the number of solutions}:
    We want to calculate the total number of
    possible solutions.
    \end{itemize}

    We will first see how dynamic programming can
    be used to find an optimal solution,
    and then we will use the same idea for
    counting the solutions.

    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone
    in every competitive programmer's career.
    While the basic idea is simple,
    the challenge is how to apply
    dynamic programming to different problems.
    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems
    that are a good starting point.

    \section{Coin problem}

    We first focus on a problem that we
    have already seen in Chapter 6:
    Given a set of coin values $\texttt{coins} = \{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k\}$
    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to
    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.

    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a
    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest
    possible coin.
    The greedy algorithm works, for example,
    when the coins are the euro coins,
    but in the general case the greedy algorithm
    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.

    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently
    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm
    works for any coin set.
    The dynamic programming
    algorithm is based on a recursive function
    that goes through all possibilities how to
    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.
    However, the dynamic programming
    algorithm is efficient because
    it uses \emph{memoization} and
    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.

    \subsubsection{Recursive formulation}

    The idea in dynamic programming is to
    formulate the problem recursively so
    that the solution to the problem can be
    calculated from solutions to smaller
    subproblems.
    In the coin problem, a natural recursive
    problem is as follows:
    what is the smallest number of coins
    required to form a sum $x$?

    Let $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    denote the minimum
    number of coins required for a sum $x$.
    The values of the function depend on the
    values of the coins.
    For example, if $\texttt{coins} = \{1,3,4\}$,
    the first values of the function are as follows:

    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\
    \texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,
    because at least 3 coins are needed
    to form the sum 10.
    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.

    The essential property of $\texttt{solve}$ is
    that its values can be
    recursively calculated from its smaller values.
    The idea is to focus on the \emph{first}
    coin that we choose for the sum.
    For example, in the above scenario,
    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.
    If we first choose coin 1,
    the remaining task is to form the sum 9
    using the minimum number of coins,
    which is a subproblem of the original problem.
    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.
    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula
    to calculate the minimum number of coins:
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \texttt{solve}(x) = \min( & \texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case of the recursion is $\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    For example,
    \[ \texttt{solve}(10) = \texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\]

    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function
    that calculates the minimum number of
    coins needed to form a sum $x$:
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{solve}(x) = \begin{cases}
                   \infty               & x < 0\\
                   0               & x = 0\\
                   \min_{c \in \texttt{coins}} \texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\infty$,
    because it is impossible to form a negative
    sum of money.
    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through
    all possibilities how to choose the first coin
    of the sum.

    Once a recursive function that solves the problem
    has been found,
    we can directly implement a solution in C++
    (the constant \texttt{INF} denotes infinity):

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Still, this function is not efficient,
    because there may be an exponential number of ways
    to construct the sum.
    However, next we will see how to make the
    function efficient using a technique called memoization.

    \subsubsection{Using memoization}

    \index{memoization}

    The idea of dynamic programming is to use
    \key{memoization} to efficiently calculate
    values of a recursive function.
    This means that the values of the function
    are stored in an array after calculating them.
    For each parameter, the value of the function
    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,
    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.

    In this problem, we use arrays
    \begin{lstlisting}
    bool ready[N];
    int value[N];
    \end{lstlisting}

    where $\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates
    whether the value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,
    and if it is, $\texttt{value}[x]$
    contains this value.
    The constant $N$ has been chosen so
    that all required values fit in the arrays.

    Now the function can be efficiently
    implemented as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        if (ready[x]) return value[x];
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        value[x] = best;
        ready[x] = true;
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function handles the base cases
    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.
    Then the function checks from
    $\texttt{ready}[x]$ if
    $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored
    in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    and if it is, the function directly returns it.
    Otherwise the function calculates the value
    of $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    recursively and stores it in $\texttt{value}[x]$.

    This function works efficiently,
    because the answer for each parameter $x$
    is calculated recursively only once.
    After a value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the
    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.
    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(nk)$,
    where $n$ is the target sum and $k$ is the number of coins.

    Note that we can also \emph{iteratively}
    construct the array \texttt{value} using
    a loop that simply calculates all the values
    of $\texttt{solve}$ for parameters $0 \ldots n

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. We can smash two rocks together, and the result depends on their weights. If the weights are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If they are different, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the lighter rock's weight. We repeat this process until at most one rock is left. Our goal is to find the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock, or 0 if no rocks are left.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. The idea is to partition the rocks into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. This is similar to the subset sum problem, where we try to find a subset of numbers that sum up to a target value. Here, the target is half of the total weight of all rocks. We will use a dynamic programming table to keep track of achievable sums and find the closest sum to half of the total weight. The smallest possible weight of the last stone is the difference between the total weight and twice this closest sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function lastStoneWeightII(stones):
       total_weight = sum of all stones
       target = total_weight // 2
       dp = array of size (target + 1) initialized to False
       dp[0] = True

       for each stone in stones:
           for j from target down to stone:
               dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

       for j from target down to 0:
           if dp[j] is True:
               return total_weight - 2 * j
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**

        target = total_weight // 2
        
        # Initialize a DP array to track achievable sums
        dp = [False] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: zero sum is always achievable
        
        # Update the DP array for each stone

INFO - [Task id] 495 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. We can smash two rocks together, and the result depends on their weights. If the weights are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If they are different, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the lighter rock's weight. We repeat this process until at most one rock is left. Our goal is to find the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock, or 0 if no rocks are left.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. The idea is to partition the rocks into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. This is similar to the subset sum problem, where we try to find a subset of numbers that sum up to a target value. Here, the target is half of the total weight of all rocks. We will use a dynamic programming table to keep track of achievable sums and find the closest sum to half of the total weight. The smallest possible weight of the last stone is the difference between the total weight and twice this closest sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function lastStoneWeightII(stones):
       total_weight = sum of all stones
       target = total_weight // 2
       dp = array of size (target + 1) initialized to False
       dp[0] = True

       for each stone in stones:
           for j from target down to stone:
               dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

       for j from target down to 0:
           if dp[j] is True:
               return total_weight - 2 * j
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**

    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:

        # The target is half of the total weight
        target = total_weight // 2
        
        # Initialize a DP array to track achievable sums
        dp = [False] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: zero sum is always achievable
        
        # Update the DP array for each stone
        for stone in stones:
            # Traverse backwards to avoid overwriting results of the current iteration

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the smallest possible weight of the last remaining stone after repeatedly smashing pairs of stones together. The core concept here is similar to the subset sum problem, where we aim to partition the stones into two groups with minimal weight difference. This is a classic dynamic programming problem.

The strategy that worked involved using a dynamic programming approach to track achievable sums of stone weights. By iterating over each stone and updating a DP array, we could determine the closest sum to half of the total weight. The final result is derived from the difference between the total weight and twice this closest sum.

Key insights include recognizing the problem as a variation of the subset sum problem and using a backward iteration in the DP update to prevent overwriting results within the same iteration. This approach efficiently finds the optimal solution without needing to simulate every possible pair of stone smashes.

The solution was implemented successfully, passing all test cases, and demonstrated the power of dynamic programming in solving partitioning problems.

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {0}
        total = sum(stones)
        for stone in stones:
            dp |= {_sum + stone for _sum in dp}
        return min(abs(total - _sum - _sum) for _sum in dp)

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the "Last Stone Weight II" problem, the official solution provides an insightful approach using a set to track achievable sums, which is both elegant and efficient.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Set-Based Dynamic Programming:**
   - The official solution uses a set `dp` to keep track of all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones. This is a clever use of set operations to dynamically update possible sums without explicitly using a 2D array, which is common in traditional dynamic programming approaches.

2. **Union Operation:**
   - The line `dp |= {_sum + stone for _sum in dp}` efficiently updates the set of possible sums by adding the current stone's weight to each of the existing sums. This operation is both concise and powerful, leveraging Python's set operations to handle the dynamic programming state transitions.

3. **Minimizing the Difference:**
   - The final step involves calculating the minimum possible difference between the total weight and twice any achievable sum. This is done using the expression `min(abs(total - _sum - _sum) for _sum in dp)`, which directly computes the smallest possible weight of the last stone.

### Comparison with My Approach:

- **Efficiency and Simplicity:**
  - The official solution is more efficient in terms of space complexity because it uses a set instead of a list, which avoids the need for a fixed-size array. This makes the solution more flexible and potentially faster due to the reduced overhead of managing a large array.
  
- **Elegance:**
  - The use of set operations to manage the dynamic programming state is more elegant and concise compared to the traditional approach of using a boolean array. It reduces the complexity of the code and makes it easier to understand and maintain.

Overall, the official solution is a great example of how leveraging Python's built-in data structures can lead to more efficient and elegant solutions. This experience highlights the importance of considering alternative data structures and operations when designing algorithms, especially in dynamic programming problems.
