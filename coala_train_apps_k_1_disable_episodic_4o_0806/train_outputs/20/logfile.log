## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature of a restaurant to satisfy all customers based on their preferred temperature ranges at specific times. The restaurant's air conditioner can heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. Each customer has a specific time they visit and a temperature range they prefer. We need to check if we can adjust the temperature to be within each customer's preferred range at their visit time.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial temperature and time at 0.
2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the previous customer (or from time 0 for the first customer).
3. **Temperature Range Calculation**: Determine the possible temperature range at the customer's visit time by considering the time difference and the ability to change the temperature by 1 degree per minute.
4. **Check Satisfaction**: For each customer, check if their preferred temperature range overlaps with the possible temperature range at their visit time.
5. **Update Temperature Range**: Adjust the possible temperature range for the next customer based on the current customer's constraints.
6. **Output Result**: If all customers can be satisfied, output "YES", otherwise "NO".

## Pseudocode

```
function can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read n, m
        current_time = 0
        min_temp = max_temp = m
        
        for each customer:
            read t_i, l_i, h_i
            time_diff = t_i - current_time
            
            # Update possible temperature range
            min_temp -= time_diff
            max_temp += time_diff
            
            # Check if the customer's range is satisfiable
            if max_temp < l_i or min_temp > h_i:
                print "NO"
                break
            
            # Update the possible range for the next customer
            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)
            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)
            
            # Update current time
            current_time = t_i
        else:
            print "YES"
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, m = test_case[0]
        customers = test_case[1]
        
        current_time = 0
        min_temp = max_temp = m
        
        possible = True
        for t_i, l_i, h_i in customers:
            time_diff = t_i - current_time
            
            # Update possible temperature range
            min_temp -= time_diff
            max_temp += time_diff
            
            # Check if the customer's range is satisfiable
            if max_temp < l_i or min_temp > h_i:
                possible = False
                break
            
            # Update the possible range for the next customer
            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)
            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)
            
            # Update current time
            current_time = t_i
        
        if possible:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
index = 0
q = int(data[index])
index += 1
test_cases = []

for _ in range(q):
    n, m = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    customers = []
    for _ in range(n):
        t_i, l_i, h_i = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        customers.append((t_i, l_i, h_i))
    test_cases.append(((n, m), customers))

# Get results
results = can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if all customers can be satisfied by adjusting the temperature within their preferred ranges. It outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input

3 0
5 1 2

-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

    [description for function: main]
    The function reads input data from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and for each test case, a sequence length and the sequence itself. It processes each test case to determine if the sum of the sequence is within a specific range defined by the sequence length. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the sequence is between 0 and the maximum possible reduction, calculated as the sum of the first N natural numbers. It stores "YES" if the sum is within this range and "NO" otherwise. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

    [end of description]
    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a sequence of integers can be transformed into a sequence with a specific property, such as having a sum of zero, through a series of allowed operations. The problem involves understanding how to manipulate sequences using index-based operations, which is a common theme in algorithmic challenges. This can be applied in competitive programming, algorithm design, and problem-solving where constraints and operations need to be carefully considered to achieve a desired outcome. The solution involves calculating the sum of the sequence and comparing it to the maximum possible reduction achievable through the operations, which is a useful technique in optimization problems.

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

Gildong owns a restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is comfortable for all customers who have made reservations. Each customer has a preferred temperature range and a specific time they will arrive. The restaurant's air conditioner can heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. We need to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to satisfy all customers at their respective arrival times.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial temperature and the air conditioner off.
2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the previous customer (or from time 0 for the first customer).
3. **Temperature Range Calculation**: Determine the possible temperature range at the current customer's arrival time by considering the time difference and the air conditioner's ability to change the temperature by 1 degree per minute.
4. **Check Satisfaction**: Ensure that the customer's preferred temperature range overlaps with the possible temperature range. If it does, update the possible temperature range for the next iteration.
5. **Output Result**: If all customers can be satisfied, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".

 ## Problem Restatement

Gildong owns a restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is comfortable for all customers who have made reservations. Each customer has a preferred temperature range and a specific time they will arrive. The restaurant's air conditioner can heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. We need to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to satisfy all customers at their respective arrival times.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial temperature and the air conditioner off.
2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the previous customer (or from time 0 for the first customer).
3. **Temperature Range Calculation**: Determine the possible temperature range at the current customer's arrival time by considering the time difference and the air conditioner's ability to change the temperature by 1 degree per minute.
4. **Check Satisfaction**: Ensure that the customer's preferred temperature range overlaps with the possible temperature range. If it does, update the possible temperature range for the next iteration.
5. **Output Result**: If all customers can be satisfied, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".

## Pseudocode

```
function canSatisfyAllCustomers(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read n, m
        initialize current_temp_range as (m, m)
        initialize current_time as 0
        satisfied = True
        
        for each customer in test_case:
            read t_i, l_i, h_i
            time_diff = t_i - current_time
            min_temp, max_temp = current_temp_range
            
            # Calculate possible temperature range at t_i
            min_possible_temp = min_temp - time_diff
            max_possible_temp = max_temp + time_diff
            
            # Update the possible temperature range to satisfy the current customer
            new_min_temp = max(min_possible_temp, l_i)
            new_max_temp = min(max_possible_temp, h_i)
            
            if new_min_temp > new_max_temp:
                satisfied = False
                break

            current_temp_range = (new_min_temp, new_max_temp)
            current_time = t_i

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to manage a dynamic temperature range to satisfy multiple customers with specific temperature preferences at given times. The challenge was to ensure that the temperature could be adjusted within the constraints of the air conditioner's capabilities (heating or cooling by 1 degree per minute) to meet each customer's requirements at their arrival time.

The successful strategy involved iterating over each customer and calculating the possible temperature range at their arrival time. This was done by considering the time elapsed since the last customer and adjusting the current temperature range accordingly. The key was to ensure that the customer's preferred temperature range overlapped with the possible temperature range. If it did, the range was updated for the next customer; if not, it was impossible to satisfy all customers, and the result was "NO" for that test case.

The solution was implemented efficiently by maintaining a running range of possible temperatures and updating it as each customer was processed. This approach ensured that the solution was both time-efficient and easy to understand. The problem reinforced the importance of managing state and constraints dynamically in algorithmic problems.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 20 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Gildong owns a restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is comfortable for all customers who have made reservations. Each customer has a preferred temperature range and a specific time they will arrive. The restaurant's air conditioner can heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. We need to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to satisfy all customers at their respective arrival times.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial temperature and the air conditioner off.
2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the previous customer (or from time 0 for the first customer).
3. **Temperature Range Calculation**: Determine the possible temperature range at the current customer's arrival time by considering the time difference and the air conditioner's ability to change the temperature by 1 degree per minute.
4. **Check Satisfaction**: Ensure that the customer's preferred temperature range overlaps with the possible temperature range. If it does, update the possible temperature range for the next iteration.
5. **Output Result**: If all customers can be satisfied, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".

            current_temp_range = (new_min_temp, new_max_temp)
            current_time = t_i
        
        if satisfied:
            print "YES"

            print "NO"

    else:
        print("NO")

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution closely mirrored the official solution. Both approaches involved iterating over each customer, calculating the possible temperature range at their arrival time, and checking if it overlaps with their preferred range. If all customers can be satisfied, we output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Key insights from the official solution:
- The official solution uses a similar approach to calculate the possible temperature range at each customer's arrival time by considering the time difference and adjusting the range accordingly.
- It uses a flag to determine if all customers can be satisfied, which is a simple and effective way to handle the logic.
- The solution sorts the customer information, although the problem guarantees that the input is already sorted by time. This step is redundant but does not affect the correctness.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of carefully managing state changes over time and ensuring that constraints are met at each step. The solution is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, which is optimal given the constraints.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the core concept was to manage a dynamic temperature range to satisfy multiple customers with specific temperature preferences at given times. The challenge was to ensure that the temperature could be adjusted within the constraints of the air conditioner's capabilities (heating ...,
