    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to transform a given integer `n` into `0` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:\n   - Change the rightmost bit (0th bit) in the binary representation of `n`.\n   - Change the `i-th` bit if the `(i-1)-th` bit is `1` and all bits from `0` to `(i-2)` are `0`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The problem can be approached by understanding the binary representation of `n`. The operations allowed are essentially flipping bits under certain conditions. The key is to determine the minimum number of such flips required to turn all bits to `0`.\n\n   The solution involves:\n   - Using a recursive approach to determine the number of operations needed to transform `n` to `0`.\n   - If `n` is `0`, no operations are needed.\n   - If `n` is `1`, one operation is needed to flip the 0th bit.\n   - For larger numbers, recursively determine the number of operations needed for the number formed by removing the most significant bit, and adjust based on whether the most significant bit is `1` or `0`.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function minimumOneBitOperations(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 0\n       if n is 1:\n           return 1\n       find the most significant bit position of n\n       let m be the number formed by removing the most significant bit\n       if the most significant bit of n is 1:\n           return (1 << position) - 1 - minimumOneBitOperations(m)\n       else:\n           return minimumOneBitOperations(m)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n        # Helper function to calculate the minimum operations\n        def helper(n):\n            if n == 0:\n                return 0\n            if n == 1:\n                return 1\n            \n            # Find the most significant bit position\n            msb_pos = n.bit_length() - 1\n            \n            # Calculate the number formed by removing the most significant bit\n            m = n ^ (1 << msb_pos)\n            \n            # If the most significant bit is 1, use the formula\n            if n & (1 << msb_pos):\n                return (1 << msb_pos) - 1 - helper(m)\n            else:\n                return helper(m)\n        \n        # Call the helper function with the initial number\n        return helper(n)\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive approach to determine the minimum number of operations needed to transform `n` into `0` by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and bit manipulation.",
