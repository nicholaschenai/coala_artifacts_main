    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\nAlice has a set of cards represented by an array of integers. She wants to rearrange these cards into groups where each group has exactly W cards, and the cards in each group are consecutive numbers. We need to determine if it's possible to rearrange the cards in such a way.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n- First, check if the total number of cards is divisible by W. If not, it's impossible to form groups of size W.\n- Sort the cards to easily find consecutive sequences.\n- Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each card.\n- Iterate through the sorted cards, and for each card, try to form a group of W consecutive cards starting from that card.\n- For each card in the group, decrease its count in the dictionary. If any card needed for the group is not available (count is zero), return false.\n- If we can form all groups successfully, return true.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n```\nfunction isNStraightHand(hand, W):\n    if length of hand is not divisible by W:\n        return false\n    \n    sort the hand array\n    create a dictionary to count occurrences of each card\n    \n    for each card in sorted hand:\n        if count of card is greater than 0:\n            for i from 0 to W-1:\n                if count of card + i is zero:\n                    return false\n                decrease count of card + i by 1\n    \n    return true\n```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], W: int) -> bool:\n        # Check if the total number of cards is divisible by W\n        if len(hand) % W != 0:\n            return False\n        \n        # Sort the hand to easily find consecutive sequences\n        hand.sort()\n        \n        # Dictionary to count occurrences of each card\n        card_count = {}\n        for card in hand:\n            if card in card_count:\n                card_count[card] += 1\n            else:\n                card_count[card] = 1\n        \n        # Try to form groups starting from each card\n        for card in hand:\n            if card_count[card] > 0:  # If this card is still available\n                # Try to form a group of W consecutive cards\n                for i in range(W):\n                    if card_count.get(card + i, 0) == 0:\n                        return False\n                    card_count[card + i] -= 1\n        \n        # If all groups are formed successfully\n        return True\n```",
