INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays within `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

## Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, identify the positions of all odd numbers in the array.
   - Use these positions to determine the subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.
   - For each subarray with exactly `k` odd numbers, calculate the number of possible subarrays by considering the number of even numbers before the first odd number and after the last odd number in the subarray.
   - Use a sliding window approach to efficiently count these subarrays.

## Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a list `odd_indices` to store indices of odd numbers in `nums`.
   Iterate over `nums` and populate `odd_indices` with indices of odd numbers.
   
   Initialize `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of nice subarrays.
   
   Iterate over `odd_indices` with a window of size `k`:
       - For each window, calculate the number of even numbers before the first odd number in the window.
       - Calculate the number of even numbers after the last odd number in the window.
       - The number of nice subarrays for this window is the product of the two calculated numbers.
       - Add this product to `count`.
   
   Return `count`.
   ```

## Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Find all indices of odd numbers in the array
        odd_indices = []
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num % 2 == 1:
                odd_indices.append(i)
        
        # Step 2: Initialize the count of nice subarrays
        count = 0
        
        # Step 3: Iterate over the odd indices with a window of size k
        for i in range(len(odd_indices) - k + 1):
            # Start and end of the current window of k odd numbers
            start = odd_indices[i]
            end = odd_indices[i + k - 1]
            
            # Calculate the number of even numbers before the first odd number in the window
            if i == 0:
                left_even_count = start + 1
            else:
                left_even_count = start - odd_indices[i - 1]
            
            # Calculate the number of even numbers after the last odd number in the window
            if i + k == len(odd_indices):
                right_even_count = len(nums) - end
            else:
                right_even_count = odd_indices[i + k] - end
            
            # Add the number of nice subarrays for this window to the count
            count += left_even_count * right_even_count
        
        # Step 4: Return the total count of nice subarrays
        return count
```

This solution efficiently counts the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by leveraging the positions of odd numbers and calculating possible subarrays using a sliding window approach.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the number of unique results obtained by performing a bitwise OR operation on all possible contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The key concept here is understanding how the bitwise OR operation works and how it can be efficiently applied to subarrays.

    ### Core Concepts:
    - **Bitwise OR Operation**: This operation results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. This property means that the OR result can only increase or stay the same as more elements are included in the subarray.
    - **Set for Uniqueness**: Using a set to store results ensures that each OR result is counted only once, as sets automatically handle duplicates.

    ### Strategy:
    - **Iterative Approach**: For each element in the array, calculate the OR for all subarrays ending at that element. This is done by extending the OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element with the current element.
    - **Efficiency**: Instead of recalculating the OR for each subarray from scratch, leverage the results of previous calculations to build upon them.

    ### Solution:
    The solution involved iterating over the array and maintaining two sets: one for the current OR results (`current`) and another for all unique results (`results`). For each element, update the `current` set with new OR results and add these to the `results` set. Finally, the size of the `results` set gives the number of unique OR results.

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
            results = set()
            current = set()
        
            for x in A:
                current = {y | x for y in current} | {x}
                results.update(current)
        
            return len(results)
    ```

    This approach efficiently calculates the unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the bitwise OR operation and using sets to manage uniqueness. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays (subsequences of consecutive elements) that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify which numbers in the array are odd. This can be done by checking if a number modulo 2 is not zero.

2. **Track Odd Counts**: As we iterate through the array, we will keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.

3. **Use a Dictionary for Prefix Counts**: We will use a dictionary to store the count of subarrays that have a certain number of odd numbers. This will help us quickly determine how many subarrays end at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers.

4. **Calculate Nice Subarrays**: For each position in the array, calculate how many subarrays end at that position with exactly `k` odd numbers by using the prefix counts stored in the dictionary.

5. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the array, updating the count of odd numbers and using the dictionary to count the number of nice subarrays.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a dictionary `prefix_counts` with a default value of 0 and set `prefix_counts[0] = 1` to handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning.
2. Initialize `odd_count` to 0 and `nice_count` to 0.
3. Iterate through each number in `nums`:
   - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.
   - If `odd_count - k` exists in `prefix_counts`, add its value to `nice_count`.
   - Increment the count of `odd_count` in `prefix_counts`.
4. Return `nice_count`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store the count of prefix sums
        prefix_counts = {0: 1}
        odd_count = 0
        nice_count = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            # Check if the number is odd
            if num % 2 == 1:
                odd_count += 1
            
            # If there exists a prefix with odd_count - k, it means there is a subarray
            # ending at the current position with exactly k odd numbers
            if odd_count - k in prefix_counts:
                nice_count += prefix_counts[odd_count - k]
            
            # Update the prefix count for the current number of odd numbers
            if odd_count in prefix_counts:
                prefix_counts[odd_count] += 1
            else:
                prefix_counts[odd_count] = 1
        
        return nice_count
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a dictionary `prefix_counts` to keep track of how many times each count of odd numbers has been seen as we iterate through the array.
- `odd_count` keeps track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.
- For each number in `nums`, we check if it is odd and update `odd_count`.
- We then check if there is a prefix with `odd_count - k` in `prefix_counts`. If it exists, it means there are subarrays ending at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers, and we add the count of such prefixes to `nice_count`.
- Finally, we update the dictionary with the current `odd_count`.

- For each number in `nums`, we check if it is odd and update `odd_count`.
- We then check if there is a prefix with `odd_count - k` in `prefix_counts`. If it exists, it means there are subarrays ending at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers, and we add the count of such prefixes to `nice_count`.

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a dictionary `prefix_counts` to keep track of how many times each count of odd numbers has been seen as we iterate through the array.
- `odd_count` keeps track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.
- For each number in `nums`, we check if it is odd and update `odd_count`.
- We then check if there is a prefix with `odd_count - k` in `prefix_counts`. If it exists, it means there are subarrays ending at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers, and we add the count of such prefixes to `nice_count`.
- Finally, we update the dictionary with the current `odd_count`.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within a given array that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums to efficiently count subarrays with specific properties, which is a common pattern in problems involving subarray sums or counts.

The successful strategy involved using a dictionary to track the number of times each count of odd numbers has been encountered as we iterate through the array. This allows us to quickly determine how many subarrays end at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers by checking if there exists a prefix with `odd_count - k`.

Key steps included:
- Initializing a dictionary `prefix_counts` with a default entry for zero odd numbers to handle subarrays starting from the beginning.
- Iterating through the array, updating the count of odd numbers, and using the dictionary to count subarrays with the desired property.
- Incrementing the dictionary entry for the current count of odd numbers to keep track of all possible subarray configurations.

This approach efficiently handles the problem within the constraints, avoiding the need for nested loops that would be computationally expensive for large arrays. The use of prefix sums and a dictionary for counting is a powerful technique for similar problems involving subarray properties.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays (subsequences of consecutive elements) that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify which numbers in the array are odd. This can be done by checking if a number modulo 2 is not zero.

2. **Track Odd Counts**: As we iterate through the array, we will keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.

3. **Use a Dictionary for Prefix Counts**: We will use a dictionary to store the count of subarrays that have a certain number of odd numbers. This will help us quickly determine how many subarrays end at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers.

4. **Calculate Nice Subarrays**: For each position in the array, calculate how many subarrays end at that position with exactly `k` odd numbers by using the prefix counts stored in the dictionary.

5. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the array, updating the count of odd numbers and using the dictionary to count the number of nice subarrays.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a dictionary `prefix_counts` with a default value of 0 and set `prefix_counts[0] = 1` to handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning.
2. Initialize `odd_count` to 0 and `nice_count` to 0.
3. Iterate through each number in `nums`:
   - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.
   - If `odd_count - k` exists in `prefix_counts`, add its value to `nice_count`.
   - Increment the count of `odd_count` in `prefix_counts`.
4. Return `nice_count`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store the count of prefix sums
        prefix_counts = {0: 1}
        odd_count = 0
        nice_count = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            # Check if the number is odd
            if num % 2 == 1:
                odd_count += 1
            
            # If there exists a prefix with odd_count - k, it means there is a subarray
            # ending at the current position with exactly k odd numbers
            if odd_count - k in prefix_counts:
                nice_count += prefix_counts[odd_count - k]
            
            # Update the prefix count for the current number of odd numbers
            if odd_count in prefix_counts:
                prefix_counts[odd_count] += 1
            else:
                prefix_counts[odd_count] = 1
        
        return nice_count
```

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # save all even subarray's length which between odds
        edge = []
        res = 0

        for i in nums:
            # odd
            if i % 2:
                # +1 because range from 0 to count when doing combination
                edge.append(count+1)
                count = 0
            # even
            else:
                count += 1
        edge.append(count+1)
        # no enough odd
        if len(edge)-1 < k:
            return 0
        else:
            # combination
            for i in range(len(edge)-k):
                res += edge[i] * edge[i+k]
            return res

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Different Approach**: The official solution takes a different approach by focusing on the lengths of even subarrays between odd numbers. This is insightful because it simplifies the problem by reducing it to a combination problem, where the number of nice subarrays is determined by the product of the lengths of even subarrays before and after a sequence of `k` odd numbers.

2. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It iterates through the array once to collect the lengths of even subarrays and then uses a simple loop to calculate the number of nice subarrays. This avoids the need for a dictionary to track prefix sums, which can be more memory-intensive.

3. **Edge Handling**: The solution handles edge cases effectively by appending the count of even numbers after the last odd number to the `edge` list. This ensures that all potential subarrays are considered, even those that end at the last element of the array.

4. **Combination Logic**: The use of combination logic (`edge[i] * edge[i+k]`) to calculate the number of nice subarrays is a clever way to leverage the structure of the problem. It directly computes the number of ways to form subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by considering the possible starting and ending points.

Overall, the official solution provides a more elegant and potentially more performant approach to solving the problem by focusing on the structure of the array and leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers. This is a valuable lesson in problem-solving: sometimes, transforming the problem into a different form can lead to simpler and more efficient solutions.
