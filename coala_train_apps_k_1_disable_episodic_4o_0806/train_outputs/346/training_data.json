    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within a given array that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums to efficiently count subarrays with specific properties, which is a common pattern in problems involving subarray sums or counts.\n\nThe successful strategy involved using a dictionary to track the number of times each count of odd numbers has been encountered as we iterate through the array. This allows us to quickly determine how many subarrays end at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers by checking if there exists a prefix with `odd_count - k`.\n\nKey steps included:\n- Initializing a dictionary `prefix_counts` with a default entry for zero odd numbers to handle subarrays starting from the beginning.\n- Iterating through the array, updating the count of odd numbers, and using the dictionary to count subarrays with the desired property.\n- Incrementing the dictionary entry for the current count of odd numbers to keep track of all possible subarray configurations.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem within the constraints, avoiding the need for nested loops that would be computationally expensive for large arrays. The use of prefix sums and a dictionary for counting is a powerful technique for similar problems involving subarray properties.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Different Approach**: The official solution takes a different approach by focusing on the lengths of even subarrays between odd numbers. This is insightful because it simplifies the problem by reducing it to a combination problem, where the number of nice subarrays is determined by the product of the lengths of even subarrays before and after a sequence of `k` odd numbers.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It iterates through the array once to collect the lengths of even subarrays and then uses a simple loop to calculate the number of nice subarrays. This avoids the need for a dictionary to track prefix sums, which can be more memory-intensive.\n\n3. **Edge Handling**: The solution handles edge cases effectively by appending the count of even numbers after the last odd number to the `edge` list. This ensures that all potential subarrays are considered, even those that end at the last element of the array.\n\n4. **Combination Logic**: The use of combination logic (`edge[i] * edge[i+k]`) to calculate the number of nice subarrays is a clever way to leverage the structure of the problem. It directly computes the number of ways to form subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by considering the possible starting and ending points.\n\nOverall, the official solution provides a more elegant and potentially more performant approach to solving the problem by focusing on the structure of the array and leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers. This is a valuable lesson in problem-solving: sometimes, transforming the problem into a different form can lead to simpler and more efficient solutions.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThe function calculates the number of contiguous subarrays within a given list of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the count of prefix sums, where a prefix sum is the cumulative count of odd numbers encountered so far. As it iterates through the list, it updates the count of odd numbers and checks if there exists a prefix sum that would allow for a subarray with exactly `k` odd numbers. If such a prefix sum exists, it increments the count of \"nice\" subarrays. The function returns the total count of these subarrays.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to find subarrays with specific properties, such as a certain number of odd numbers, within a larger array. This problem is a classic example of using prefix sums and hash maps to efficiently count subarrays that meet a given condition, which is a common technique in competitive programming and algorithm design. It can be applied to problems involving counting subarrays with a fixed sum, finding subarrays with a certain number of even numbers, or any similar problem where a specific count of elements is required. Understanding this approach helps in optimizing solutions for large input sizes, as it avoids the need for nested loops and reduces the time complexity significantly."
