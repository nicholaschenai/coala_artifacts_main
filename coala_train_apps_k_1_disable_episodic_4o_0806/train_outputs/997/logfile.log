INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a class of students, each starting with a score of 10. Over a month, the teacher assigns several questions, each with a complexity factor. For each question, a range of students' scores is multiplied by the complexity factor. Our task is to determine the mean of the maximum possible scores for all students after all questions have been applied, and output the floor of this mean for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Apply Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students in the specified range by the complexity factor.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.
4. **Output Result**: Output the floored mean for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for N students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        # Apply the complexity factor k to the scores from index i-1 to j-1
        for index from i-1 to j-1:
            scores[index] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T  # Number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read N, M  # Number of students and number of questions
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k  # Question details
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        # Process the test case and get the result
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        
        # Output the result
        print(result)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for N students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        # Apply the complexity factor k to the scores from index i-1 to j-1
        for index in range(i-1, j):
            scores[index] *= k
    
    # Calculate the mean of the scores
    total_score = sum(scores)
    mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index])
            j = int(data[index + 1])
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        # Process the test case and get the result
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        
        # Store the result
        results.append(result)
    
    # Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input data, processes each test case by updating student scores based on the given questions, calculates the mean of the scores, and outputs the floored mean for each test case.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m 
            def mod_min(r, n, m):
                a = fraction(r, m)
                p, q = convergents(a)
                for i in range(2, len(q)):
                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):
                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]
                        return q[i-1] + t*q[i]

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after they have solved a series of questions. Each student starts with a score of 10. For each question, the scores of students within a specified roll number range are multiplied by the complexity of the question. We need to compute the floor value of the mean of these maximum scores for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity of the question.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.
4. **Output Result**: Output the floor value of the mean for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for roll_number from i to j:
            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, M
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k
            append (i, j, k) to questions
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for all students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        # Update scores for the range of students
        for roll_number in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k
    
    # Calculate the total score
    total_score = sum(scores)
    
    # Calculate the mean score and take the floor
    mean_score = total_score // N
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index])
            j = int(data[index + 1])
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input data, processes each test case by updating student scores based on the given questions, and then calculates and outputs the floor of the mean score for each test case.

 ### Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after they have solved a series of questions. Each student starts with a score of 10. For each question, the scores of students within a specified roll number range are multiplied by the complexity of the question. We need to compute the floor value of the mean of these maximum scores for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity of the question.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.
4. **Output Result**: Output the floor value of the mean for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for roll_number from i to j:
            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, M
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k
            append (i, j, k) to questions
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for all students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        # Update scores for the range of students
        for roll_number in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k
    
    # Calculate the total score
    total_score = sum(scores)
    
    # Calculate the mean score and take the floor
    mean_score = total_score // N
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])

    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])

        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index])
            j = int(data[index + 1])
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))

        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.

- Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The problem seems to be related to the way the input is being read and processed. The code is designed to read from standard input, but it appears that the function `main()` is not being called, which is why no output is being produced. This is a common issue when the main function is defined but not executed.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure the `main()` function is called**: The `main()` function should be invoked to execute the logic of the program. This is a common oversight when defining a main function in a script.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly and that the data is being split and processed as expected.

3. **Check Output**: Make sure that the results are being printed correctly after processing each test case.

### Revised Solution

Let's make sure the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to ensure the program executes as intended.

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for all students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        # Update scores for the range of students
        for roll_number in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k
    
    # Calculate the total score
    total_score = sum(scores)
    
    # Calculate the mean score and take the floor
    mean_score = total_score // N
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index])
            j = int(data[index + 1])
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Ensure the main function is called
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Calling `main()`**: The script now includes a check to call `main()` if the script is executed as the main module. This ensures that the program logic is executed when the script runs.
- **Standard Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming and similar environments. The input is split into a list of strings for processing.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the program will now execute and produce output as expected.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The problem seems to be related to the way the input is being read and processed. The code is designed to read from standard input, but it appears that the function `main()` is not being called, which is why no output is being produced. This is a common issue when the main function is defined but not executed.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure the `main()` function is called**: The `main()` function should be invoked to execute the logic of the program. This is a common oversight when defining a main function in a script.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly and that the data is being split and processed as expected.

3. **Check Output**: Make sure that the results are being printed correctly after processing each test case.

### Revised Solution

Let's make sure the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to ensure the program executes as intended.

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for all students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        # Update scores for the range of students
        for roll_number in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k
    
    # Calculate the total score
    total_score = sum(scores)
    
    # Calculate the mean score and take the floor
    mean_score = total_score // N
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index])
            j = int(data[index + 1])
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Ensure the main function is called
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Calling `main()`**: The script now includes a check to call `main()` if the script is executed as the main module. This ensures that the program logic is executed when the script runs.
- **Standard Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming and similar environments. The input is split into a list of strings for processing.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the program will now execute and produce output as expected.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to iteratively remove a specific substring ("abc") from a given string until it no longer appears. This required understanding how to efficiently search and modify strings in Python. The key function used was `str.replace()`, which allows for the removal of the first occurrence of a substring. This function was used in a loop to ensure all instances of "abc" were removed.

    The main strategy was to use a while loop to repeatedly apply the `replace` method until the string stabilized (i.e., no more "abc" substrings were present). This approach is straightforward and effective for the given constraints, where the maximum string length is 1000 and the number of test cases is small.

    The solution was implemented in a function `remove_abc_pairs`, which encapsulates the logic for removing "abc" substrings. Another function, `process_test_cases`, was used to handle multiple test cases, reading input and outputting results accordingly.

    Overall, the problem reinforced the use of string manipulation techniques in Python and the importance of iterating until a stable state is reached. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
- Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$
- $1 \leq k \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----

Original Constraints 

-----Sample Input:-----
1
5 3
1 3 5
2 5 2
3 4 7

-----Sample Output:-----
202

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Initial score of students will be : $[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$
after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 50, 50, 10, 10]$
after solving question 2 scores will be: $[50, 100, 100, 20, 20]$
after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 100, 700, 140, 20]$
Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will $(50+100+700+140+20)/5 = 202$

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after they have solved a series of questions. Each student starts with a score of 10. For each question, the scores of students within a specified roll number range are multiplied by the complexity of the question. We need to compute the floor value of the mean of these maximum scores for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity of the question.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.
4. **Output Result**: Output the floor value of the mean for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for roll_number from i to j:
            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, M
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k
            append (i, j, k) to questions
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for all students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        # Update scores for the range of students
        for roll_number in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k
    
    # Calculate the total score
    total_score = sum(scores)
    
    # Calculate the mean score and take the floor
    mean_score = total_score // N
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index])
            j = int(data[index + 1])
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of maximum possible scores for students after they solve a series of questions, with each question affecting a range of students' scores. The core concept involved efficiently updating scores for a range of students and calculating the mean of these scores.

Initially, the main issue was that the `main()` function was not being called, which resulted in no output being produced. This is a common oversight when defining a main function in a script. The solution was to ensure that the `main()` function is called by using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct, which is a standard practice in Python to execute code only when the script is run directly.

The strategy that worked involved:
1. Initializing all student scores to 10.
2. Iterating over each question and updating the scores for the specified range of students by multiplying their scores by the question's complexity.
3. Calculating the total score and deriving the floor of the mean score for output.

This problem reinforced the importance of correctly handling input and output in competitive programming environments, especially when dealing with large input sizes. It also highlighted the need to ensure that the main execution logic is properly invoked in scripts.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?

- Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after they have solved a series of questions. Each student starts with a score of 10. For each question, the scores of students within a specified roll number range are multiplied by the complexity of the question. We need to compute the floor value of the mean of these maximum scores for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.
2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity of the question.
3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.
4. **Output Result**: Output the floor value of the mean for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    scores = array of size N initialized to 10
    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:
        for roll_number from i to j:
            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k
    total_score = sum of scores
    mean_score = total_score // N
    return mean_score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, M
        questions = []
        for M times:
            read i, j, k
            append (i, j, k) to questions
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for all students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        # Update scores for the range of students
        for roll_number in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k
    
    # Calculate the total score
    total_score = sum(scores)
    
    # Calculate the mean score and take the floor
    mean_score = total_score // N
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index])
            j = int(data[index + 1])
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input data, processes each test case by updating student scores based on the given questions, and then calculates and outputs the floor of the mean score for each test case.

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The problem seems to be related to the way the input is being read and processed. The code is designed to read from standard input, but it appears that the function `main()` is not being called, which is why no output is being produced. This is a common issue when the main function is defined but not executed.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure the `main()` function is called**: The `main()` function should be invoked to execute the logic of the program. This is a common oversight when defining a main function in a script.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read correctly and that the data is being split and processed as expected.

3. **Check Output**: Make sure that the results are being printed correctly after processing each test case.

### Revised Solution

Let's make sure the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to ensure the program executes as intended.

```python
def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
    # Initialize scores for all students
    scores = [10] * N
    
    # Process each question
    for i, j, k in questions:
        # Update scores for the range of students
        for roll_number in range(i, j + 1):
            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k
    
    # Calculate the total score
    total_score = sum(scores)
    
    # Calculate the mean score and take the floor
    mean_score = total_score // N
    
    return mean_score

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        M = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        questions = []
        for _ in range(M):
            i = int(data[index])
            j = int(data[index + 1])
            k = int(data[index + 2])
            index += 3
            questions.append((i, j, k))
        
        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Ensure the main function is called
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Calling `main()`**: The script now includes a check to call `main()` if the script is executed as the main module. This ensures that the program logic is executed when the script runs.
- **Standard Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming and similar environments. The input is split into a list of strings for processing.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the program will now execute and produce output as expected.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem involved updating scores for a range of students based on the complexity of questions and then calculating the mean of these scores. My initial approach was correct in terms of logic, but I missed calling the `main()` function, which led to no output being produced. This was a simple oversight that was easily corrected by ensuring the function was called.

#### Key Insights:

1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses a dictionary to store scores, initializing them only when needed. This is efficient in terms of space when not all students are affected by questions. My solution initialized all scores upfront, which is simpler but uses more space.

2. **Looping Over Ranges**: Both solutions correctly loop over the specified range of student roll numbers to update scores. This is crucial for applying the complexity factor correctly.

3. **Mean Calculation**: Both solutions calculate the mean by summing the scores and using integer division to get the floor value. This is a straightforward approach given the problem constraints.

4. **Error Handling**: The official solution includes a try-except block to handle potential input errors gracefully. This is a good practice in competitive programming to avoid runtime errors due to unexpected input.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of ensuring that the main function is executed and highlighted different ways to handle input and data storage efficiently. The official solution's use of a dictionary is a useful technique for handling sparse data updates.
