    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after they have solved a series of questions. Each student starts with a score of 10. For each question, the scores of students within a specified roll number range are multiplied by the complexity of the question. We need to compute the floor value of the mean of these maximum scores for each test case.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize Scores**: Start by initializing the scores of all students to 10.\n2. **Process Questions**: For each question, multiply the scores of students within the specified roll number range by the complexity of the question.\n3. **Calculate Mean**: After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and take the floor of this mean.\n4. **Output Result**: Output the floor value of the mean for each test case.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n    scores = array of size N initialized to 10\n    for each question (i, j, k) in questions:\n        for roll_number from i to j:\n            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k\n    total_score = sum of scores\n    mean_score = total_score // N\n    return mean_score\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read N, M\n        questions = []\n        for M times:\n            read i, j, k\n            append (i, j, k) to questions\n        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n        print result\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n    # Initialize scores for all students\n    scores = [10] * N\n    \n    # Process each question\n    for i, j, k in questions:\n        # Update scores for the range of students\n        for roll_number in range(i, j + 1):\n            scores[roll_number - 1] *= k\n    \n    # Calculate the total score\n    total_score = sum(scores)\n    \n    # Calculate the mean score and take the floor\n    mean_score = total_score // N\n    \n    return mean_score\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        M = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        questions = []\n        for _ in range(M):\n            i = int(data[index])\n            j = int(data[index + 1])\n            k = int(data[index + 2])\n            index += 3\n            questions.append((i, j, k))\n        \n        result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input data, processes each test case by updating student scores based on the given questions, and then calculates and outputs the floor of the mean score for each test case.",
