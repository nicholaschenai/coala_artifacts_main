For each number in the sequence, we need to find its largest prime factor. Then, we determine which of these largest prime factors appears most frequently. If there is a tie, we choose the largest prime factor among the most frequent ones.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**: For each number in the sequence, determine its largest prime factor.\n2. **Frequency Count**: Count the frequency of each largest prime factor across the sequence.\n3. **Determine Result**: Identify the prime factor with the highest frequency. If there is a tie, select the largest prime factor.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. **Precompute Largest Prime Factors**:\n   - Use a sieve-like approach to precompute the largest prime factor for every number up to the maximum possible value (100,000).\n\n2. **Process Each Test Case**:\n   - For each test case, read the sequence of numbers.\n   - For each number, retrieve its largest prime factor using the precomputed data.\n   - Count the frequency of each largest prime factor.\n   - Determine the prime factor with the highest frequency.
