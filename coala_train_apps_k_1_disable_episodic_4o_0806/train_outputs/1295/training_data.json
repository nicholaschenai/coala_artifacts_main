    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n**Core Concepts:**\n- The problem involves computing a sum S(N, K) for each query, where we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number from the first N Fibonacci numbers until only one number remains.\n- The Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 has a periodicity of 60, which allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.\n\n**Strategies and Challenges:**\n- **Precomputation:** The initial strategy was to precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and simulate the removal process for each sequence length from 1 to 60. This was intended to allow each query to be answered in constant time.\n- **Simulating the Removal Process:** The main challenge was correctly simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. The logic needed to ensure that the sequence was reduced correctly to a single number.\n- **Handling Edge Cases:** A critical oversight was not handling the case where `N % 60` results in `0`, which should correspond to using the full cycle of 60.\n\n**Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**\n- The initial implementation incorrectly handled the sequence reduction, leading to incorrect results. The logic was adjusted to ensure that even-indexed elements were retained correctly.\n- The solution was further refined by ensuring that when `N % 60` is `0`, the full cycle of 60 should be used, which was a key fix to align with the problem's requirements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The problem highlighted the importance of understanding periodicity in sequences and correctly simulating iterative processes. The key takeaway is to ensure that edge cases are handled appropriately, especially when dealing with modular arithmetic and periodic sequences.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The task was to compute a sum S(N, K) for each query, where we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number from the first N Fibonacci numbers until only one number remains. My initial approach misunderstood the problem, focusing on the periodicity of Fibonacci numbers modulo 10, which was not directly applicable to the problem's requirements.\n\n2. **Official Solution Insights:**\n   - The official solution uses a mathematical approach to compute the Fibonacci numbers efficiently using matrix exponentiation, which is a well-known technique for calculating Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. This is crucial for handling large values of N efficiently.\n   - The solution also involves modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, which is essential given the constraints (1 <= N, K <= 10^18).\n\n3. **Mistakes in My Approach:**\n   - My approach incorrectly focused on simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements, which was not the correct interpretation of the problem. The problem required a more mathematical approach to compute the sum S(N, K) using properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic.\n   - I did not consider the need for efficient computation of Fibonacci numbers for very large indices, which the official solution addresses with matrix exponentiation.\n\n4. **Key Takeaways:**\n   - When dealing with problems involving large numbers and sequences, consider mathematical techniques like matrix exponentiation for efficient computation.\n   - Ensure a clear understanding of the problem requirements and constraints before diving into implementation.\n   - Modular arithmetic is a powerful tool for handling large numbers in competitive programming, especially when dealing with constraints involving large powers or sums.\n\nOverall, the official solution provided a more efficient and mathematically sound approach to solving the problem, highlighting the importance of understanding the underlying mathematical properties and leveraging efficient algorithms.",
