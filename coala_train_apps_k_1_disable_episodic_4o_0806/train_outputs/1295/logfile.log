INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a number of queries, Q. Each query consists of two integers, N and K. For each query, we need to calculate the sum S(N, K) which is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers modulo K. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2) for i >= 2

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so calculating it directly for large N is inefficient. However, we only need the sum modulo K, which can be simplified using properties of modular arithmetic.

2. **Use Pisano Period**: The Fibonacci sequence modulo any number K is periodic, known as the Pisano period. This means that after a certain number of terms, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo K repeats. We can use this property to reduce the computation for large N.

3. **Calculate Pisano Period**: For each query, calculate the Pisano period for the given K. This will help us determine how the Fibonacci sequence behaves under modulo K.

4. **Sum within Pisano Period**: Once the Pisano period is known, calculate the sum of Fibonacci numbers within one full period. Use this to compute the sum for N terms by considering how many full periods fit into N and the remainder.

5. **Compute Result for Each Query**: For each query, use the Pisano period and the precomputed sums to quickly calculate the result S(N, K).

## Pseudocode

```
function pisano_period(k):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i from 0 to k*k:
        a, b = b, (a + b) % k
        if a == 0 and b == 1:
            return i + 1

function fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):
    period = pisano_period(k)
    full_periods = n // period
    remainder = n % period
    
    fib_mod = [0, 1]
    for i from 2 to period:
        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)
    
    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k
    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k
    
    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k

function main():
    read Q
    for each query:
        read N, K
        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def pisano_period(k):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(k * k):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % k
        if a == 0 and b == 1:
            return i + 1

def fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):
    period = pisano_period(k)
    full_periods = n // period
    remainder = n % period
    
    fib_mod = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, period):
        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)
    
    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k
    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k
    
    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution efficiently calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers modulo K for each query by leveraging the periodic nature of the Fibonacci sequence under modulo operations.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key insight was recognizing the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10, which repeats every 60 numbers. This allowed us to reduce the problem size significantly by only considering the first 60 Fibonacci numbers for any given N. 

    The strategy involved precomputing the last digits of these 60 Fibonacci numbers and then simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements for each possible sequence length from 1 to 60. This precomputation step enabled us to store the results in a lookup table, allowing each test case to be resolved in constant time by simply using the precomputed results.

    The solution was efficient due to the use of modular arithmetic to reduce N to a manageable size and the precomputation of results, which is a common technique in problems involving periodic sequences. This approach ensured that even with the maximum constraints, the solution remained performant. 

    Overall, this problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns and periodicity in sequences, and how precomputation can be leveraged to handle large input sizes efficiently.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate a sum, S(N, K), for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K. The sum S(N, K) is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers, but with a twist: after calculating the first N Fibonacci numbers, we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number until only one number remains. The task is to compute this final number for each query.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Fibonacci sequence has a known periodicity when taken modulo 10, which is 60. This means that the last digit of Fibonacci numbers repeats every 60 numbers. We can use this property to reduce the problem size significantly. For each query, we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. We can precompute the results for all possible sequence lengths from 1 to 60, simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains. This allows us to answer each query in constant time by using precomputed results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   For each possible sequence length from 1 to 60:
       Simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains.
       Store the result in a lookup table.
   
   For each query (N, K):
       Reduce N modulo 60 to get the effective length of the sequence.
       Use the lookup table to get the result for this sequence length.
       Output the result.

   We need to calculate a sum, S(N, K), for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K. The sum S(N, K) is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers, but with a twist: after calculating the first N Fibonacci numbers, we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number until only one number remains. The task is to compute this final number for each query.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Fibonacci sequence has a known periodicity when taken modulo 10, which is 60. This means that the last digit of Fibonacci numbers repeats every 60 numbers. We can use this property to reduce the problem size significantly. For each query, we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. We can precompute the results for all possible sequence lengths from 1 to 60, simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains. This allows us to answer each query in constant time by using precomputed results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   For each possible sequence length from 1 to 60:
       Simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains.
       Store the result in a lookup table.
   
   For each query (N, K):
       Reduce N modulo 60 to get the effective length of the sequence.
       Use the lookup table to get the result for this sequence length.
       Output the result.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

```

This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and precomputing results for all possible sequence lengths up to 60. Each query is resolved in constant time using the precomputed results.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for reading input in a competitive programming context.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The code correctly parses the number of queries and each pair of integers (N, K) from the input data.

3. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and stores them in `last_digits`. This is correct.
   - It then precomputes the results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 by simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. This is also correct.

4. **Solving Queries:**
   - For each query, the code calculates `effective_length = N % 60` and uses this to index into the precomputed results. This logic is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The code appends results to a list and prints each result. This should work, but there might be an issue with how the function is structured and called.

**Potential Issues:**
- The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script intended to run directly, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.
- The environment might expect the script to execute upon running, which means the `main()` function should be invoked at the end of the script.

**Solution:**
- Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.

Let's fix this by adding a call to `main()` at the end of the script:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the script
main()
```

This should resolve the issue by ensuring the script executes the logic when run.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Let's fix the solution by ensuring the `main()` function is called, which will execute the logic for reading input, processing queries, and outputting results. Here is the corrected Python code:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

-----Output-----

Output Q lines with one integer each. The ith line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Q <= 5*104
- 1 <= N <= 1018
- 1 <= K <= 1018

-----Example-----
Input:
1
1 1
Output:
1

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate a sum, S(N, K), for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K. The sum S(N, K) is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers, but with a twist: after calculating the first N Fibonacci numbers, we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number until only one number remains. The task is to compute this final number for each query.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Fibonacci sequence has a known periodicity when taken modulo 10, which is 60. This means that the last digit of Fibonacci numbers repeats every 60 numbers. We can use this property to reduce the problem size significantly. For each query, we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. We can precompute the results for all possible sequence lengths from 1 to 60, simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains. This allows us to answer each query in constant time by using precomputed results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   For each possible sequence length from 1 to 60:
       Simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains.
       Store the result in a lookup table.
   
   For each query (N, K):
       Reduce N modulo 60 to get the effective length of the sequence.
       Use the lookup table to get the result for this sequence length.
       Output the result.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]

        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

```

This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and precomputing results for all possible sequence lengths up to 60. Each query is resolved in constant time using the precomputed results.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for reading input in a competitive programming context.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The code correctly parses the number of queries and each pair of integers (N, K) from the input data.

3. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and stores them in `last_digits`. This is correct.
   - It then precomputes the results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 by simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. This is also correct.

4. **Solving Queries:**
   - For each query, the code calculates `effective_length = N % 60` and uses this to index into the precomputed results. This logic is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The code appends results to a list and prints each result. This should work, but there might be an issue with how the function is structured and called.

**Potential Issues:**
- The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script intended to run directly, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.
- The environment might expect the script to execute upon running, which means the `main()` function should be invoked at the end of the script.

**Solution:**
- Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.

Let's fix this by adding a call to `main()` at the end of the script:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries

    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the script
main()
```

This should resolve the issue by ensuring the script executes the logic when run.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to compute a sum S(N, K) for each query, where we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number from the first N Fibonacci numbers until only one number remains.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers. This is correct because the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 repeats every 60 numbers.
   - The precomputation of results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 is intended to simulate the removal process. However, the logic for simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements might be incorrect.

3. **Simulating the Removal Process:**
   - The current logic removes odd-indexed elements until one number remains, but it seems to be producing incorrect results. The expected output for the test case is `1`, but the code outputs `0`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The removal process might not be correctly implemented. The sequence should be reduced by removing elements at odd indices, but the logic might not be correctly capturing the intended behavior.

5. **Solution:**
   - Re-evaluate the logic for simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. Ensure that the process correctly reduces the sequence to a single number.

Let's fix the logic for simulating the removal process and ensure it correctly computes the final number for each sequence length:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            # Correctly simulate the removal of odd-indexed elements
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 0]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the script

```

This code should now correctly simulate the removal process by keeping even-indexed elements, which aligns with the intended behavior of the problem.

Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

-----Output-----

Output Q lines with one integer each. The ith line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Q <= 5*104
- 1 <= N <= 1018
- 1 <= K <= 1018

-----Example-----
Input:
1
1 1
Output:
1

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate a sum, S(N, K), for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K. The sum S(N, K) is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers, but with a twist: after calculating the first N Fibonacci numbers, we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number until only one number remains. The task is to compute this final number for each query.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Fibonacci sequence has a known periodicity when taken modulo 10, which is 60. This means that the last digit of Fibonacci numbers repeats every 60 numbers. We can use this property to reduce the problem size significantly. For each query, we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. We can precompute the results for all possible sequence lengths from 1 to 60, simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains. This allows us to answer each query in constant time by using precomputed results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   For each possible sequence length from 1 to 60:
       Simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains.
       Store the result in a lookup table.
   
   For each query (N, K):
       Reduce N modulo 60 to get the effective length of the sequence.
       Use the lookup table to get the result for this sequence length.
       Output the result.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

```

This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and precomputing results for all possible sequence lengths up to 60. Each query is resolved in constant time using the precomputed results.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for reading input in a competitive programming context.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The code correctly parses the number of queries and each pair of integers (N, K) from the input data.

3. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and stores them in `last_digits`. This is correct.
   - It then precomputes the results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 by simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. This is also correct.

4. **Solving Queries:**
   - For each query, the code calculates `effective_length = N % 60` and uses this to index into the precomputed results. This logic is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The code appends results to a list and prints each result. This should work, but there might be an issue with how the function is structured and called.

**Potential Issues:**
- The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script intended to run directly, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.
- The environment might expect the script to execute upon running, which means the `main()` function should be invoked at the end of the script.

**Solution:**
- Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.

Let's fix this by adding a call to `main()` at the end of the script:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the script
main()
```

This should resolve the issue by ensuring the script executes the logic when run.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to compute a sum S(N, K) for each query, where we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number from the first N Fibonacci numbers until only one number remains.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers. This is correct because the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 repeats every 60 numbers.
   - The precomputation of results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 is intended to simulate the removal process. However, the logic for simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements might be incorrect.

3. **Simulating the Removal Process:**
   - The current logic removes odd-indexed elements until one number remains, but it seems to be producing incorrect results. The expected output for the test case is `1`, but the code outputs `0`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The removal process might not be correctly implemented. The sequence should be reduced by removing elements at odd indices, but the logic might not be correctly capturing the intended behavior.

5. **Solution:**
   - Re-evaluate the logic for simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. Ensure that the process correctly reduces the sequence to a single number.

Let's fix the logic for simulating the removal process and ensure it correctly computes the final number for each sequence length:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

    return output

    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key insight was recognizing the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10, which repeats every 60 numbers. This allowed us to reduce the problem size significantly by only considering the first 60 Fibonacci numbers for any given N. 

    The strategy involved precomputing the last digits of these 60 Fibonacci numbers and then simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements for each possible sequence length from 1 to 60. This precomputation step enabled us to store the results in a lookup table, allowing each test case to be resolved in constant time by simply using the precomputed results.

    The solution was efficient due to the use of modular arithmetic to reduce N to a manageable size and the precomputation of results, which is a common technique in problems involving periodic sequences. This approach ensured that even with the maximum constraints, the solution remained performant. 

    Overall, this problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns and periodicity in sequences, and how precomputation can be leveraged to handle large input sizes efficiently.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

-----Output-----

Output Q lines with one integer each. The ith line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Q <= 5*104
- 1 <= N <= 1018
- 1 <= K <= 1018

-----Example-----
Input:
1
1 1
Output:
1

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate a sum, S(N, K), for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K. The sum S(N, K) is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers, but with a twist: after calculating the first N Fibonacci numbers, we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number until only one number remains. The task is to compute this final number for each query.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Fibonacci sequence has a known periodicity when taken modulo 10, which is 60. This means that the last digit of Fibonacci numbers repeats every 60 numbers. We can use this property to reduce the problem size significantly. For each query, we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. We can precompute the results for all possible sequence lengths from 1 to 60, simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains. This allows us to answer each query in constant time by using precomputed results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   For each possible sequence length from 1 to 60:
       Simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains.
       Store the result in a lookup table.
   
   For each query (N, K):
       Reduce N modulo 60 to get the effective length of the sequence.
       Use the lookup table to get the result for this sequence length.
       Output the result.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

```

This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and precomputing results for all possible sequence lengths up to 60. Each query is resolved in constant time using the precomputed results.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for reading input in a competitive programming context.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The code correctly parses the number of queries and each pair of integers (N, K) from the input data.

3. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and stores them in `last_digits`. This is correct.
   - It then precomputes the results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 by simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. This is also correct.

4. **Solving Queries:**
   - For each query, the code calculates `effective_length = N % 60` and uses this to index into the precomputed results. This logic is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The code appends results to a list and prints each result. This should work, but there might be an issue with how the function is structured and called.

**Potential Issues:**
- The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script intended to run directly, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.
- The environment might expect the script to execute upon running, which means the `main()` function should be invoked at the end of the script.

**Solution:**
- Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.

Let's fix this by adding a call to `main()` at the end of the script:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the script
main()
```

This should resolve the issue by ensuring the script executes the logic when run.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

-----Output-----

Output Q lines with one integer each. The ith line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Q <= 5*104
- 1 <= N <= 1018
- 1 <= K <= 1018

-----Example-----
Input:
1
1 1
Output:
1

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate a sum, S(N, K), for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K. The sum S(N, K) is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers, but with a twist: after calculating the first N Fibonacci numbers, we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number until only one number remains. The task is to compute this final number for each query.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Fibonacci sequence has a known periodicity when taken modulo 10, which is 60. This means that the last digit of Fibonacci numbers repeats every 60 numbers. We can use this property to reduce the problem size significantly. For each query, we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. We can precompute the results for all possible sequence lengths from 1 to 60, simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains. This allows us to answer each query in constant time by using precomputed results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   For each possible sequence length from 1 to 60:
       Simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains.
       Store the result in a lookup table.
   
   For each query (N, K):
       Reduce N modulo 60 to get the effective length of the sequence.
       Use the lookup table to get the result for this sequence length.
       Output the result.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

```

This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and precomputing results for all possible sequence lengths up to 60. Each query is resolved in constant time using the precomputed results.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for reading input in a competitive programming context.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The code correctly parses the number of queries and each pair of integers (N, K) from the input data.

3. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and stores them in `last_digits`. This is correct.
   - It then precomputes the results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 by simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. This is also correct.

4. **Solving Queries:**
   - For each query, the code calculates `effective_length = N % 60` and uses this to index into the precomputed results. This logic is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The code appends results to a list and prints each result. This should work, but there might be an issue with how the function is structured and called.

**Potential Issues:**
- The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script intended to run directly, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.
- The environment might expect the script to execute upon running, which means the `main()` function should be invoked at the end of the script.

**Solution:**
- Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.

Let's fix this by adding a call to `main()` at the end of the script:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the script
main()
```

This should resolve the issue by ensuring the script executes the logic when run.

2. **Precomputation:**

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key insight was recognizing the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10, which repeats every 60 numbers. This allowed us to reduce the problem size significantly by only considering the first 60 Fibonacci numbers for any given N. 

    The strategy involved precomputing the last digits of these 60 Fibonacci numbers and then simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements for each possible sequence length from 1 to 60. This precomputation step enabled us to store the results in a lookup table, allowing each test case to be resolved in constant time by simply using the precomputed results.

    The solution was efficient due to the use of modular arithmetic to reduce N to a manageable size and the precomputation of results, which is a common technique in problems involving periodic sequences. This approach ensured that even with the maximum constraints, the solution remained performant.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Let's fix the solution by ensuring the logic for simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements is correctly implemented. The key is to keep even-indexed elements in each iteration until only one element remains. Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            # Correctly simulate the removal of odd-indexed elements
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 0]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        if effective_length == 0:
            effective_length = 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the script
main()
```

This code should now correctly simulate the removal process by keeping even-indexed elements, which aligns with the intended behavior of the problem. The `main()` function is called at the end to ensure the script executes properly. The key fix is to handle the case where `N % 60` results in `0`, which should correspond to using the full cycle of 60.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

-----Output-----

Output Q lines with one integer each. The ith line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Q <= 5*104
- 1 <= N <= 1018
- 1 <= K <= 1018

-----Example-----
Input:
1
1 1
Output:
1

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate a sum, S(N, K), for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K. The sum S(N, K) is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers, but with a twist: after calculating the first N Fibonacci numbers, we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number until only one number remains. The task is to compute this final number for each query.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Fibonacci sequence has a known periodicity when taken modulo 10, which is 60. This means that the last digit of Fibonacci numbers repeats every 60 numbers. We can use this property to reduce the problem size significantly. For each query, we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. We can precompute the results for all possible sequence lengths from 1 to 60, simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains. This allows us to answer each query in constant time by using precomputed results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   For each possible sequence length from 1 to 60:
       Simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains.
       Store the result in a lookup table.
   
   For each query (N, K):
       Reduce N modulo 60 to get the effective length of the sequence.
       Use the lookup table to get the result for this sequence length.
       Output the result.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]

        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)

        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results

    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:

This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 and precomputing results for all possible sequence lengths up to 60. Each query is resolved in constant time using the precomputed results.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for reading input in a competitive programming context.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The code correctly parses the number of queries and each pair of integers (N, K) from the input data.

3. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and stores them in `last_digits`. This is correct.
   - It then precomputes the results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 by simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. This is also correct.

4. **Solving Queries:**
   - For each query, the code calculates `effective_length = N % 60` and uses this to index into the precomputed results. This logic is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The code appends results to a list and prints each result. This should work, but there might be an issue with how the function is structured and called.

**Potential Issues:**
- The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script intended to run directly, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.
- The environment might expect the script to execute upon running, which means the `main()` function should be invoked at the end of the script.

**Solution:**
- Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.

Let's fix this by adding a call to `main()` at the end of the script:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2

    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries

    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the script
main()
```

This should resolve the issue by ensuring the script executes the logic when run.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to compute a sum S(N, K) for each query, where we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number from the first N Fibonacci numbers until only one number remains.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers. This is correct because the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 repeats every 60 numbers.
   - The precomputation of results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 is intended to simulate the removal process. However, the logic for simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements might be incorrect.

3. **Simulating the Removal Process:**
   - The current logic removes odd-indexed elements until one number remains, but it seems to be producing incorrect results. The expected output for the test case is `1`, but the code outputs `0`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The removal process might not be correctly implemented. The sequence should be reduced by removing elements at odd indices, but the logic might not be correctly capturing the intended behavior.

5. **Solution:**
   - Re-evaluate the logic for simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. Ensure that the process correctly reduces the sequence to a single number.

Let's fix the logic for simulating the removal process and ensure it correctly computes the final number for each sequence length:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute a sum S(N, K) for each query, where we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number from the first N Fibonacci numbers until only one number remains.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers. This is correct because the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 repeats every 60 numbers.
   - The precomputation of results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 is intended to simulate the removal process. However, the logic for simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements might be incorrect.

3. **Simulating the Removal Process:**
   - The current logic removes odd-indexed elements until one number remains, but it seems to be producing incorrect results. The expected output for the test case is `1`, but the code outputs `0`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The removal process might not be correctly implemented. The sequence should be reduced by removing elements at odd indices, but the logic might not be correctly capturing the intended behavior.
   - The issue might be with how the sequence is being reduced. The logic should ensure that the sequence is reduced correctly to a single number.

5. **Solution:**
   - Re-evaluate the logic for simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. Ensure that the process correctly reduces the sequence to a single number.

**Key Insight:**
- The problem might be with the initial understanding of the sequence reduction. The sequence should be reduced by removing elements at odd indices, but the logic might not be correctly capturing the intended behavior.

Let's fix the logic for simulating the removal process and ensure it correctly computes the final number for each sequence length:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):

        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

**Core Concepts:**
- The problem involves computing a sum S(N, K) for each query, where we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number from the first N Fibonacci numbers until only one number remains.
- The Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 has a periodicity of 60, which allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.

**Strategies and Challenges:**
- **Precomputation:** The initial strategy was to precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and simulate the removal process for each sequence length from 1 to 60. This was intended to allow each query to be answered in constant time.
- **Simulating the Removal Process:** The main challenge was correctly simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. The logic needed to ensure that the sequence was reduced correctly to a single number.
- **Handling Edge Cases:** A critical oversight was not handling the case where `N % 60` results in `0`, which should correspond to using the full cycle of 60.

**Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
- The initial implementation incorrectly handled the sequence reduction, leading to incorrect results. The logic was adjusted to ensure that even-indexed elements were retained correctly.
- The solution was further refined by ensuring that when `N % 60` is `0`, the full cycle of 60 should be used, which was a key fix to align with the problem's requirements.

**Conclusion:**
- The problem highlighted the importance of understanding periodicity in sequences and correctly simulating iterative processes. The key takeaway is to ensure that edge cases are handled appropriately, especially when dealing with modular arithmetic and periodic sequences.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate a sum, S(N, K), for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K. The sum S(N, K) is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers, but with a twist: after calculating the first N Fibonacci numbers, we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number until only one number remains. The task is to compute this final number for each query.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Fibonacci sequence has a known periodicity when taken modulo 10, which is 60. This means that the last digit of Fibonacci numbers repeats every 60 numbers. We can use this property to reduce the problem size significantly. For each query, we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers modulo 10. We can precompute the results for all possible sequence lengths from 1 to 60, simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains. This allows us to answer each query in constant time by using precomputed results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   For each possible sequence length from 1 to 60:
       Simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until one number remains.
       Store the result in a lookup table.
   
   For each query (N, K):
       Reduce N modulo 60 to get the effective length of the sequence.
       Use the lookup table to get the result for this sequence length.
       Output the result.
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for reading input in a competitive programming context.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The code correctly parses the number of queries and each pair of integers (N, K) from the input data.

3. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and stores them in `last_digits`. This is correct.
   - It then precomputes the results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 by simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. This is also correct.

4. **Solving Queries:**
   - For each query, the code calculates `effective_length = N % 60` and uses this to index into the precomputed results. This logic is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The code appends results to a list and prints each result. This should work, but there might be an issue with how the function is structured and called.

**Potential Issues:**
- The `main()` function is defined but not called. In a script intended to run directly, the `main()` function should be called to execute the logic.
- The environment might expect the script to execute upon running, which means the `main()` function should be invoked at the end of the script.

**Solution:**
- Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic.

Let's fix this by adding a call to `main()` at the end of the script:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []

        while len(sequence) > 1:
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 1]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2

    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the script

This should resolve the issue by ensuring the script executes the logic when run.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to compute a sum S(N, K) for each query, where we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number from the first N Fibonacci numbers until only one number remains.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The code precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers. This is correct because the Fibonacci sequence modulo 10 repeats every 60 numbers.
   - The precomputation of results for each sequence length from 1 to 60 is intended to simulate the removal process. However, the logic for simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements might be incorrect.

3. **Simulating the Removal Process:**
   - The current logic removes odd-indexed elements until one number remains, but it seems to be producing incorrect results. The expected output for the test case is `1`, but the code outputs `0`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The removal process might not be correctly implemented. The sequence should be reduced by removing elements at odd indices, but the logic might not be correctly capturing the intended behavior.

5. **Solution:**
   - Re-evaluate the logic for simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. Ensure that the process correctly reduces the sequence to a single number.

Let's fix the logic for simulating the removal process and ensure it correctly computes the final number for each sequence length:

```python
def precompute_fibonacci_last_digits():
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[-1] + last_digits[-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def precompute_results(last_digits):
    # Precompute the result for each sequence length from 1 to 60
    results = []
    for length in range(1, 61):
        sequence = last_digits[:length]
        while len(sequence) > 1:
            # Correctly simulate the removal of odd-indexed elements
            sequence = [sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence)) if i % 2 == 0]
        results.append(sequence[0])
    return results

def solve_queries(queries, results):
    # Solve each query using the precomputed results
    output = []
    for N, K in queries:
        effective_length = N % 60
        output.append(results[effective_length - 1])
    return output

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of queries
    Q = int(data[0])
    
    # Read each query
    queries = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        queries.append((N, K))
        index += 2
    
    # Precompute necessary data
    last_digits = precompute_fibonacci_last_digits()
    results = precompute_results(last_digits)
    
    # Solve the queries
    output = solve_queries(queries, results)
    
    # Print the results
    for result in output:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the script
main()
```

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task was to compute a sum S(N, K) for each query, where we repeatedly remove every odd-indexed number from the first N Fibonacci numbers until only one number remains. My initial approach misunderstood the problem, focusing on the periodicity of Fibonacci numbers modulo 10, which was not directly applicable to the problem's requirements.

2. **Official Solution Insights:**
   - The official solution uses a mathematical approach to compute the Fibonacci numbers efficiently using matrix exponentiation, which is a well-known technique for calculating Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. This is crucial for handling large values of N efficiently.
   - The solution also involves modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, which is essential given the constraints (1 <= N, K <= 10^18).

3. **Mistakes in My Approach:**
   - My approach incorrectly focused on simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements, which was not the correct interpretation of the problem. The problem required a more mathematical approach to compute the sum S(N, K) using properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic.
   - I did not consider the need for efficient computation of Fibonacci numbers for very large indices, which the official solution addresses with matrix exponentiation.

4. **Key Takeaways:**
   - When dealing with problems involving large numbers and sequences, consider mathematical techniques like matrix exponentiation for efficient computation.
   - Ensure a clear understanding of the problem requirements and constraints before diving into implementation.
   - Modular arithmetic is a powerful tool for handling large numbers in competitive programming, especially when dealing with constraints involving large powers or sums.

Overall, the official solution provided a more efficient and mathematically sound approach to solving the problem, highlighting the importance of understanding the underlying mathematical properties and leveraging efficient algorithms.
