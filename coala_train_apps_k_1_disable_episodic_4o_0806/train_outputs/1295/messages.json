        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a number of queries, Q. Each query consists of two integers, N and K. For each query, we need to calculate the sum S(N, K) which is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers modulo K. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n- F(0) = 0\n- F(1) = 1\n- F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2) for i >= 2\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so calculating it directly for large N is inefficient. However, we only need the sum modulo K, which can be simplified using properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n2. **Use Pisano Period**: The Fibonacci sequence modulo any number K is periodic, known as the Pisano period. This means that after a certain number of terms, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo K repeats. We can use this property to reduce the computation for large N.\n\n3. **Calculate Pisano Period**: For each query, calculate the Pisano period for the given K. This will help us determine how the Fibonacci sequence behaves under modulo K.\n\n4. **Sum within Pisano Period**: Once the Pisano period is known, calculate the sum of Fibonacci numbers within one full period. Use this to compute the sum for N terms by considering how many full periods fit into N and the remainder.\n\n5. **Compute Result for Each Query**: For each query, use the Pisano period and the precomputed sums to quickly calculate the result S(N, K).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction pisano_period(k):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i from 0 to k*k:\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % k\n        if a == 0 and b == 1:\n            return i + 1\n\nfunction fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):\n    period = pisano_period(k)\n    full_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    fib_mod = [0, 1]\n    for i from 2 to period:\n        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)\n    \n    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k\n    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k\n    \n    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k\n\nfunction main():\n    read Q\n    for each query:\n        read N, K\n        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)\n        print result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef pisano_period(k):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in range(k * k):\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % k\n        if a == 0 and b == 1:\n            return i + 1\n\ndef fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):\n    period = pisano_period(k)\n    full_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    fib_mod = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, period):\n        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)\n    \n    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k\n    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k\n    \n    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    Q = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers modulo K for each query by leveraging the periodic nature of the Fibonacci sequence under modulo operations."

This was intended to allow each query to be answered in constant time.\n- **Simulating the Removal Process:** The main challenge was correctly simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements. The logic needed to ensure that the sequence was reduced correctly to a single number.\n- **Handling Edge Cases:** A critical oversight was not handling the case where `N % 60` results in `0`, which should correspond to using the full cycle of 60.\n\n**Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**\n- The initial implementation incorrectly handled the sequence reduction, leading to incorrect results. The logic was adjusted to ensure that even-indexed elements were retained correctly.\n- The solution was further refined by ensuring that when `N % 60` is `0`, the full cycle of 60 should be used, which was a key fix to align with the problem's requirements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The problem highlighted the importance of understanding periodicity in sequences and correctly simulating iterative processes. The key takeaway is to ensure that edge cases are handled appropriately, especially when dealing with modular arithmetic and periodic sequences."

My initial approach misunderstood the problem, focusing on the periodicity of Fibonacci numbers modulo 10, which was not directly applicable to the problem's requirements.\n\n2. **Official Solution Insights:**\n   - The official solution uses a mathematical approach to compute the Fibonacci numbers efficiently using matrix exponentiation, which is a well-known technique for calculating Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. This is crucial for handling large values of N efficiently.\n   - The solution also involves modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, which is essential given the constraints (1 <= N, K <= 10^18).\n\n3. **Mistakes in My Approach:**\n   - My approach incorrectly focused on simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements, which was not the correct interpretation of the problem. The problem required a more mathematical approach to compute the sum S(N, K) using properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic.\n   - I did not consider the need for efficient computation of Fibonacci numbers for very large indices, which the official solution addresses with matrix exponentiation.\n\n4. **Key Takeaways:**\n   - When dealing with problems involving large numbers and sequences, consider mathematical techniques like matrix exponentiation for efficient computation.\n   - Ensure a clear understanding of the problem requirements and constraints before diving into implementation.\n   - Modular arithmetic is a powerful tool for handling large numbers in competitive programming, especially when dealing with constraints involving large powers or sums.\n\nOverall, the official solution provided a more efficient and mathematically sound approach to solving the problem, highlighting the importance of understanding the underlying mathematical properties and leveraging efficient algorithms."
