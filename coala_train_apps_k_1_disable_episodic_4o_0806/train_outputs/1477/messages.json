You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.\n\nFind the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.\nThe second line contains the string S.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 50\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 50\n- S will consist of uppercase English letters.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n4\nDCBA\n7\nXYZZYZZ\n\nOutput:\nADCB\nXYYZZZZ\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB\nExample case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters.

We can perform at most one operation where we remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to rearrange the string by moving one character to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order.\n2. **Approach**:\n   - For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.\n   - For each possible new string, check if it is the smallest lexicographically.\n   - Keep track of the smallest string found.\n3. **Optimization Insight**: Since we are allowed only one move, the optimal strategy is to find the smallest character that can be moved to the front or to a position where it results in a smaller string.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the number of test cases `T`.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Read the integer `N` and the string `S`.\n   - Initialize `min_string` as the original string `S`.\n   - For each character in `S`:\n     - Remove the character and try inserting it at every other position.\n     - Form the new string and compare it with `min_string`.\n     - If the new string is smaller, update `min_string`.\n   - After checking all possibilities, store the `min_string` as the result for this test case.\n3. Print the results for all test cases.\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        N, S = test_cases[i]\n        min_string = S\n        \n        # Try removing each character and inserting it at every other position\n        for j in range(N):\n            for k in range(N):\n                if j != k:\n                    # Create a new string by removing S[j] and inserting it at position k\n                    new_string = S[:j] + S[j+1:]\n                    new_string = new_string[:k] + S[j] + new_string[k:]\n                    \n                    # Update min_string if the new string is smaller\n                    if new_string < min_string:\n                        min_string = new_string\n        \n        results.append(min_string)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    S = data[index + 1]\n    test_cases.append((N, S))\n    index += 2\n\n# Get results\nresults = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` processes each test case independently.\n- For each character in the string, it attempts to remove and reinsert it at every other position.\n- It keeps track of the smallest string found during these operations.\n- Finally, it outputs the smallest string for each test case."

The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` is defined but not called, and the input is not being read from standard input. Additionally, the function is designed to take parameters directly, which is not how the problem expects input to be handled.\n\n## Step-by-Step Correction\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The function should read from standard input, as the problem specifies that the input will be provided in a specific format. We need to read the number of test cases and then each test case string.\n\n2. **Function Call**: The function should be called after defining it, and it should handle input/output directly within the function.\n\n3. **Output Handling**: The function should print the results directly, as the problem specifies that the output should be printed for each test case.\n\n4. **Revisiting the Logic**: The logic for finding the smallest character and moving it to the front is correct, but we need to ensure that the function is executed properly with the correct input/output handling.\n\n## Revised Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_lexicographically_smallest_string():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        S = data[index + 1]\n        index += 2\n        \n        # Find the smallest character in the string\n        smallest_char = min(S)\n        \n        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character\n        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)\n        \n        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start\n        if index_of_smallest != 0:\n            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(S)\n    \n    # Output all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Call the function to execute\nfind_lexicographically_smallest_string()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Input Handling**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings.

The challenge was to ensure that the solution explored all possible single-character moves to achieve the smallest lexicographical order.\n\n### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n- **Lexicographical Order**: Understanding how to compare strings based on dictionary order was crucial.\n- **String Manipulation**: The problem required generating new strings by removing and reinserting characters, which involved careful handling of string slicing and concatenation.\n\n### Strategies:\n- Initially, the approach was to move the smallest character to the front, which worked for some cases but not all. This strategy was too simplistic and didn't account for all possible rearrangements.\n- The successful strategy involved iterating over all characters, removing each one, and trying to find the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character. The initial approach was to move the smallest character to the front, but this was insufficient for all cases. The correct approach involved iterating over all possible single-character moves, generating new strings, and comparing them to find the smallest lexicographical order. This approach ensures that all potential rearrangements are considered, leading to the correct solution. The key takeaway is to consider all possible operations when the problem allows for a single move, as the optimal solution might not be immediately obvious."

        "content": "In this problem, the task was to find the lexicographically smallest string by performing at most one operation of removing a character and inserting it at another position. The official solution and my final approach both involved iterating over all possible single-character moves to determine the smallest possible string.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Iterative Character Movement**: Both solutions involve iterating over each character in the string, removing it, and attempting to insert it at every other position. This brute-force approach ensures that all possible single-character rearrangements are considered.\n\n2. **Lexicographical Comparison**: For each rearrangement, the new string is compared to the current smallest string found. This ensures that the smallest possible string is identified.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: Given the constraints (with N up to 50), this approach is feasible. The complexity is manageable because the number of operations is limited to a maximum of the string, and then inserting it at every other position. This approach ensures that all possible single-character moves are considered, and the smallest lexicographical string is found.\n\nThe key insight from this problem is the importance of considering all possible single-character moves to find the optimal solution. Initially, I focused on moving the smallest character to the front, which was a limited approach. The official solution's method of iterating over all possible character removals and insertions is more comprehensive and ensures that the smallest possible string is found. This approach is efficient given the constraints, as the maximum string length is 50, making the O(N^2. **Iterate Over All Possible Moves**: For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position to find the smallest lexicographical order.\n\n3. **Compare All Possible Outcomes**: For each possible move, generate the new string and compare it to the current smallest string found. Update the smallest string if a new smaller one is found.\n\nThe official solution is similar to my final approach, but it is more concise and directly uses the `min` function to keep track of the smallest string found. This approach is efficient given the constraints and ensures that all possible single-character moves are considered to find the 0th index, and the rest of the string is added after it. This results in the string \"ADCB\", which is the lexicographically smallest string possible with one move.\n\n2. **Iterative Approach**: The official solution iterates over each character in the string, removes it, and tries to insert it at every possible position. This approach ensures that all possible single-character moves are considered, which is necessary to find the absolute smallest lexicographical order.\n\n3. **Comparison and Update**: For each possible rearrangement, the solution compares it to the current smallest string and updates the smallest string if a new, smaller one is found. This ensures that the final result is the smallest possible string.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient given the constraints, as it only considers a single move for each character and checks all possible positions for that move. This is feasible within the problem's constraints (N \u2264 50).\n\nOverall, the official solution is effective in ensuring that all possible single-character moves are considered, which is crucial for finding the lexicographically smallest string. My initial approach was too narrow in scope, focusing only on moving the smallest character to the front, which did not account for all possible rearrangements. The final solution I, and many others, have been using for years. The official solution is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that all possible single-character moves are considered to find the lexicographically smallest string. This approach is optimal given the constraints and guarantees that the smallest possible string is found."

For each string, it attempts to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by removing each character and reinserting it at every other position. It compares each newly formed string with the current smallest string and updates it if a smaller one is found. The results for all test cases are collected and printed in sequence.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to rearrange characters in a string to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order with minimal operations. This can be applied in text processing, data sorting, and optimization problems where constraints limit the number of operations. It is particularly relevant in competitive programming and algorithm design, where understanding how to manipulate strings efficiently can lead to optimal solutions. The problem also highlights the importance of considering all possible permutations within given constraints to find the best solution."
