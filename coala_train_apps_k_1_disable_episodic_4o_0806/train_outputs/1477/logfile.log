INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters. We can perform at most one operation where we remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to rearrange the string by moving one character to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order.
2. **Approach**:
   - For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.
   - For each possible new string, check if it is the smallest lexicographically.
   - Keep track of the smallest string found.
3. **Optimization Insight**: Since we are allowed only one move, the optimal strategy is to find the smallest character that can be moved to the front or to a position where it results in a smaller string.

## Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer `N` and the string `S`.
   - Initialize `min_string` as the original string `S`.
   - For each character in `S`:
     - Remove the character and try inserting it at every other position.
     - Form the new string and compare it with `min_string`.
     - If the new string is smaller, update `min_string`.
   - After checking all possibilities, store the `min_string` as the result for this test case.
3. Print the results for all test cases.

## Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    
    for i in range(T):
        N, S = test_cases[i]
        min_string = S
        
        # Try removing each character and inserting it at every other position
        for j in range(N):
            for k in range(N):
                if j != k:
                    # Create a new string by removing S[j] and inserting it at position k
                    new_string = S[:j] + S[j+1:]
                    new_string = new_string[:k] + S[j] + new_string[k:]
                    
                    # Update min_string if the new string is smaller
                    if new_string < min_string:
                        min_string = new_string
        
        results.append(min_string)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []

for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    S = data[index + 1]
    test_cases.append((N, S))
    index += 2

# Get results
results = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` processes each test case independently.
- For each character in the string, it attempts to remove and reinsert it at every other position.
- It keeps track of the smallest string found during these operations.
- Finally, it outputs the smallest string for each test case.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to iteratively remove a specific substring ("abc") from a given string until it no longer appears. This required understanding how to efficiently search and modify strings in Python. The key function used was `str.replace()`, which allows for the removal of the first occurrence of a substring. This function was used in a loop to ensure all instances of "abc" were removed.

    The main strategy was to use a while loop to repeatedly apply the `replace` method until the string stabilized (i.e., no more "abc" substrings were present). This approach is straightforward and effective for the given constraints, where the maximum string length is 1000 and the number of test cases is small.

    The solution was implemented in a function `remove_abc_pairs`, which encapsulates the logic for removing "abc" substrings. Another function, `process_test_cases`, was used to handle multiple test cases, reading input and outputting results accordingly.

    Overall, the problem reinforced the use of string manipulation techniques in Python and the importance of iterating until a stable state is reached. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is related to how the input and output are handled. The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` is defined but not called, and the input is not being read from standard input. Additionally, the function is designed to take parameters directly, which is not how the problem expects input to be handled.

## Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Input Handling**: The function should read from standard input, as the problem specifies that the input will be provided in a specific format. We need to read the number of test cases and then each test case string.

2. **Function Call**: The function should be called after defining it, and it should handle input/output directly within the function.

3. **Output Handling**: The function should print the results directly, as the problem specifies that the output should be printed for each test case.

4. **Revisiting the Logic**: The logic for finding the smallest character and moving it to the front is correct, but we need to ensure that the function is executed properly with the correct input/output handling.

## Revised Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        S = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(S)
    
    # Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute
find_lexicographically_smallest_string()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. This allows us to process each test case in sequence.
- **Loop Through Test Cases**: We loop through each test case, extract the string, and process it to find the lexicographically smallest string.
- **Output**: We store the results in a list and print each result after processing all test cases.

This revised code should correctly handle the input and output as specified by the problem statement.

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string consisting of uppercase English letters. We can perform at most one operation where we remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to rearrange the string by moving one character to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order.

2. **Strategy**:
   - For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.
   - For each possible rearrangement, check if it results in a lexicographically smaller string than the current smallest found.
   - Keep track of the smallest string found during this process.

3. **Optimization Insight**:
   - The best move is often, the best way to achieve this is to move the smallest character to the front of the string. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each test case, read the string.
2. Identify the smallest character in the string.
3. If the smallest character is not already at the beginning of the string, remove it from its current position and insert it at the beginning.
4. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest character, move the first occurrence.
5. Output the modified string for each test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case[0]
        S = test_case[1]
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]
        
        # Output the result for this test case
        print(S)
```

## Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case[0]
        S = test_case[1]
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]

        results.append(S)

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to iteratively remove a specific substring ("abc") from a given string until it no longer appears. This required understanding how to efficiently search and modify strings in Python. The key function used was `str.replace()`, which allows for the removal of the first occurrence of a substring. This function was used in a loop to ensure all instances of "abc" were removed.

    The main strategy was to use a while loop to repeatedly apply the `replace` method until the string stabilized (i.e., no more "abc" substrings were present). This approach is straightforward and effective for the given constraints, where the maximum string length is 1000 and the number of test cases is small.

    The solution was implemented in a function `remove_abc_pairs`, which encapsulates the logic for removing "abc" substrings. Another function, `process_test_cases`, was used to handle multiple test cases, reading input and outputting results accordingly.

    Overall, the problem reinforced the use of string manipulation techniques in Python and the importance of iterating until a stable state is reached. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.

   - The best move is often, the best way to achieve this is to move the smallest character to the front of the string. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each test case, read the string.
2. Identify the smallest character in the string.
3. If the smallest character is not already at the beginning of the string, remove it from its current position and insert it at the beginning.
4. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest character, move the first occurrence.
5. Output the modified string for each test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case[0]
        S = test_case[1]
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]
        
        # Output the result for this test case
        print(S)
```

## Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case[0]
        S = test_case[1]
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(S)
    
    # Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 2
# test_cases = [(4, "DCBA"), (7, "XYZZYZZ")]
# find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases)
```

This code reads the number of test cases and each string, finds the smallest character in each string, and moves it to the front if it's not already there. It then prints the lexicographically smallest string for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is related to how the input and output are handled. The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` is defined but not called, and the input is not being read from standard input. Additionally, the function is designed to take parameters directly, which is not how the problem expects input to be handled.

## Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Input Handling**: The function should read from standard input, as the problem specifies that the input will be provided in a specific format. We need to read the number of test cases and then each test case string.

2. **Function Call**: The function should be called after defining it, and it should handle input/output directly within the function.

3. **Output Handling**: The function should print the results directly, as the problem specifies that the output should be printed for each test case.

4. **Revisiting the Logic**: The logic for finding the smallest character and moving it to the front is correct, but we need to ensure that the function is executed properly with the correct input/output handling.

## Revised Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        S = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(S)
    
    # Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute
find_lexicographically_smallest_string()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. This allows us to process each test case in sequence.
- **Loop Through Test Cases**: We loop through each test case, extract the string, and process it to find the lexicographically smallest string.
- **Output**: We store the results in a list and print each result after processing all test cases.

This revised code should correctly handle the input and output as specified by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] ## Analysis of the Problem

The current solution correctly identifies the smallest character and moves it to the front of the string. However, it does not account for the possibility of rearranging the string in a way that might result in a smaller lexicographical order by moving a character other than the smallest one.

## Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Re-evaluate the Strategy**: The current approach only considers moving the smallest character to the front. However, there might be cases where moving a different character could result in a smaller lexicographical order.

2. **Iterate Over All Possible Moves**: Instead of just moving the smallest character, we should consider removing each character and inserting it at every possible position to find the smallest lexicographical order.

3. **Compare All Possible Outcomes**: For each possible move, generate the new string and compare it to the current smallest string found. Update the smallest string if a new smaller one is found.

## Revised Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        S = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        # Initialize the smallest string as the original string
        smallest_string = S
        
        # Try removing each character and inserting it at every other position
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if i != j:
                    # Create a new string by removing the character at i and inserting it at j
                    new_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]
                    new_string = new_string[:j] + S[i] + new_string[j:]
                    
                    # Update the smallest string if the new string is smaller
                    if new_string < smallest_string:
                        smallest_string = new_string
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(smallest_string)
    
    # Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute
find_lexicographically_smallest_string()
```

### Explanation

- **Iterate Over All Characters**: For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.
- **Generate New Strings**: For each possible move, generate a new string and compare it to the current smallest string.
- **Update Smallest String**: If a new string is lexicographically smaller, update the smallest string.
- **Output**: After processing all test cases, print the smallest string for each test case. 

This approach ensures that we explore all possible single-character moves to find the lexicographically smallest string.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string consisting of uppercase English letters. We can perform at most one operation where we remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to rearrange the string by moving one character to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order.

2. **Strategy**:
   - For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.
   - For each possible rearrangement, check if it results in a lexicographically smaller string than the current smallest found.
   - Keep track of the smallest string found during this process.

3. **Optimization Insight**:
   - The best move is often, the best way to achieve this is to move the smallest character to the front of the string. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each test case, read the string.
2. Identify the smallest character in the string.
3. If the smallest character is not already at the beginning of the string, remove it from its current position and insert it at the beginning.
4. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest character, move the first occurrence.
5. Output the modified string for each test case.

### Explanation

- **Iterate Over All Characters**: For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.
- **Generate New Strings**: For each possible move, generate a new string and compare it to the current smallest string.
- **Update Smallest String**: If a new string is lexicographically smaller, update the smallest string.
- **Output**: After processing all test cases, print the smallest string for each test case. 

This approach ensures that we explore all possible single-character moves to find the lexicographically smallest string.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to iteratively remove a specific substring ("abc") from a given string until it no longer appears. This required understanding how to efficiently search and modify strings in Python. The key function used was `str.replace()`, which allows for the removal of the first occurrence of a substring. This function was used in a loop to ensure all instances of "abc" were removed.

    The main strategy was to use a while loop to repeatedly apply the `replace` method until the string stabilized (i.e., no more "abc" substrings were present). This approach is straightforward and effective for the given constraints, where the maximum string length is 1000 and the number of test cases is small.

    The solution was implemented in a function `remove_abc_pairs`, which encapsulates the logic for removing "abc" substrings. Another function, `process_test_cases`, was used to handle multiple test cases, reading input and outputting results accordingly.

    Overall, the problem reinforced the use of string manipulation techniques in Python and the importance of iterating until a stable state is reached. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string consisting of uppercase English letters. We can perform at most one operation where we remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to rearrange the string by moving one character to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order.

2. **Strategy**:
   - For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.
   - For each possible rearrangement, check if it results in a lexicographically smaller string than the current smallest found.
   - Keep track of the smallest string found during this process.

3. **Optimization Insight**:
   - The best move is often, the best way to achieve this is to move the smallest character to the front of the string. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each test case, read the string.
2. Identify the smallest character in the string.
3. If the smallest character is not already at the beginning of the string, remove it from its current position and insert it at the beginning.
4. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest character, move the first occurrence.
5. Output the modified string for each test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case[0]
        S = test_case[1]
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]
        
        # Output the result for this test case
        print(S)
```

## Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case[0]
        S = test_case[1]
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(S)
    
    # Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 2
# test_cases = [(4, "DCBA"), (7, "XYZZYZZ")]
# find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases)
```

This code reads the number of test cases and each string, finds the smallest character in each string, and moves it to the front if it's not already there. It then prints the lexicographically smallest string for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is related to how the input and output are handled. The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` is defined but not called, and the input is not being read from standard input. Additionally, the function is designed to take parameters directly, which is not how the problem expects input to be handled.

## Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Input Handling**: The function should read from standard input, as the problem specifies that the input will be provided in a specific format. We need to read the number of test cases and then each test case string.

2. **Function Call**: The function should be called after defining it, and it should handle input/output directly within the function.

3. **Output Handling**: The function should print the results directly, as the problem specifies that the output should be printed for each test case.

4. **Revisiting the Logic**: The logic for finding the smallest character and moving it to the front is correct, but we need to ensure that the function is executed properly with the correct input/output handling.

## Revised Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        S = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(S)
    
    # Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute
find_lexicographically_smallest_string()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. This allows us to process each test case in sequence.
- **Loop Through Test Cases**: We loop through each test case, extract the string, and process it to find the lexicographically smallest string.
- **Output**: We store the results in a list and print each result after processing all test cases.

This revised code should correctly handle the input and output as specified by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The current solution correctly identifies the smallest character and moves it to the front of the string. However, it does not account for the possibility of rearranging the string in a way that might result in a smaller lexicographical order by moving a character other than the smallest one.

## Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Re-evaluate the Strategy**: The current approach only considers moving the smallest character to the front. However, there might be cases where moving a different character could result in a smaller lexicographical order.

2. **Iterate Over All Possible Moves**: Instead of just moving the smallest character, we should consider removing each character and inserting it at every possible position to find the smallest lexicographical order.

3. **Compare All Possible Outcomes**: For each possible move, generate the new string and compare it to the current smallest string found. Update the smallest string if a new smaller one is found.

def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read

### Explanation

- **Iterate Over All Characters**: For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.
- **Generate New Strings**: For each possible move, generate a new string and compare it to the current smallest string.
- **Update Smallest String**: If a new string is lexicographically smaller, update the smallest string.
- **Output**: After processing all test cases, print the smallest string for each test case. 

This approach ensures that we explore all possible single-character moves to find the lexicographically smallest string.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing at most one operation of removing a character from any position in the string and inserting it back at any other position. The challenge was to ensure that the solution explored all possible single-character moves to achieve the smallest lexicographical order.

### Key Concepts and Patterns:
- **Lexicographical Order**: Understanding how to compare strings based on dictionary order was crucial.
- **String Manipulation**: The problem required generating new strings by removing and reinserting characters, which involved careful handling of string slicing and concatenation.

### Strategies:
- Initially, the approach was to move the smallest character to the front, which worked for some cases but not all. This strategy was too simplistic and didn't account for all possible rearrangements.
- The successful strategy involved iterating over all characters, removing each one, and trying to find the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character. The initial approach was to move the smallest character to the front, but this was insufficient for all cases. The correct approach involved iterating over all possible single-character moves, generating new strings, and comparing them to find the smallest lexicographical order. This approach ensures that all potential rearrangements are considered, leading to the correct solution. The key takeaway is to consider all possible operations when the problem allows for a single move, as the optimal solution might not be immediately obvious.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string consisting of uppercase English letters. We can perform at most one operation where we remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to rearrange the string by moving one character to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order.

2. **Strategy**:
   - For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.
   - For each possible rearrangement, check if it results in a lexicographically smaller string than the current smallest found.
   - Keep track of the smallest string found during this process.

3. **Optimization Insight**:
   - The best move is often, the best way to achieve this is to move the smallest character to the front of the string. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each test case, read the string.
2. Identify the smallest character in the string.
3. If the smallest character is not already at the beginning of the string, remove it from its current position and insert it at the beginning.
4. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest character, move the first occurrence.
5. Output the modified string for each test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case[0]
        S = test_case[1]
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]
        
        # Output the result for this test case
        print(S)
```

## Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N = test_case[0]
        S = test_case[1]
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(S)
    
    # Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 2
# test_cases = [(4, "DCBA"), (7, "XYZZYZZ")]
# find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases)
```

This code reads the number of test cases and each string, finds the smallest character in each string, and moves it to the front if it's not already there. It then prints the lexicographically smallest string for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is related to how the input and output are handled. The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` is defined but not called, and the input is not being read from standard input. Additionally, the function is designed to take parameters directly, which is not how the problem expects input to be handled.

## Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Input Handling**: The function should read from standard input, as the problem specifies that the input will be provided in a specific format. We need to read the number of test cases and then each test case string.

2. **Function Call**: The function should be called after defining it, and it should handle input/output directly within the function.

3. **Output Handling**: The function should print the results directly, as the problem specifies that the output should be printed for each test case.

4. **Revisiting the Logic**: The logic for finding the smallest character and moving it to the front is correct, but we need to ensure that the function is executed properly with the correct input/output handling.

## Revised Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        S = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        # Find the smallest character in the string
        smallest_char = min(S)
        
        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character
        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)
        
        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start
        if index_of_smallest != 0:
            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(S)
    
    # Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute
find_lexicographically_smallest_string()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. This allows us to process each test case in sequence.
- **Loop Through Test Cases**: We loop through each test case, extract the string, and process it to find the lexicographically smallest string.
- **Output**: We store the results in a list and print each result after processing all test cases.

This revised code should correctly handle the input and output as specified by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Problem

The current solution correctly identifies the smallest character and moves it to the front of the string. However, it does not account for the possibility of rearranging the string in a way that might result in a smaller lexicographical order by moving a character other than the smallest one.

## Step-by-Step Correction

1. **Re-evaluate the Strategy**: The current approach only considers moving the smallest character to the front. However, there might be cases where moving a different character could result in a smaller lexicographical order.

2. **Iterate Over All Possible Moves**: Instead of just moving the smallest character, we should consider removing each character and inserting it at every possible position to find the smallest lexicographical order.

3. **Compare All Possible Outcomes**: For each possible move, generate the new string and compare it to the current smallest string found. Update the smallest string if a new smaller one is found.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find the lexicographically smallest string by performing at most one operation of removing a character and inserting it at another position. The official solution and my final approach both involved iterating over all possible single-character moves to determine the smallest possible string.

### Key Insights:

1. **Iterative Character Movement**: Both solutions involve iterating over each character in the string, removing it, and attempting to insert it at every other position. This brute-force approach ensures that all possible single-character rearrangements are considered.

2. **Lexicographical Comparison**: For each rearrangement, the new string is compared to the current smallest string found. This ensures that the smallest possible string is identified.

3. **Efficiency**: Given the constraints (with N up to 50), this approach is feasible. The complexity is manageable because the number of operations is limited to a maximum of the string, and then inserting it at every other position. This approach ensures that all possible single-character moves are considered, and the smallest lexicographical string is found.

The key insight from this problem is the importance of considering all possible single-character moves to find the optimal solution. Initially, I focused on moving the smallest character to the front, which was a limited approach. The official solution's method of iterating over all possible character removals and insertions is more comprehensive and ensures that the smallest possible string is found. This approach is efficient given the constraints, as the maximum string length is 50, making the O(N^2. **Iterate Over All Possible Moves**: For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position to find the smallest lexicographical order.

3. **Compare All Possible Outcomes**: For each possible move, generate the new string and compare it to the current smallest string found. Update the smallest string if a new smaller one is found.

The official solution is similar to my final approach, but it is more concise and directly uses the `min` function to keep track of the smallest string found. This approach is efficient given the constraints and ensures that all possible single-character moves are considered to find the 0th index, and the rest of the string is added after it. This results in the string "ADCB", which is the lexicographically smallest string possible with one move.

2. **Iterative Approach**: The official solution iterates over each character in the string, removes it, and tries to insert it at every possible position. This approach ensures that all possible single-character moves are considered, which is necessary to find the absolute smallest lexicographical order.

3. **Comparison and Update**: For each possible rearrangement, the solution compares it to the current smallest string and updates the smallest string if a new, smaller one is found. This ensures that the final result is the smallest possible string.

4. **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient given the constraints, as it only considers a single move for each character and checks all possible positions for that move. This is feasible within the problem's constraints (N â‰¤ 50).

Overall, the official solution is effective in ensuring that all possible single-character moves are considered, which is crucial for finding the lexicographically smallest string. My initial approach was too narrow in scope, focusing only on moving the smallest character to the front, which did not account for all possible rearrangements. The final solution I, and many others, have been using for years. The official solution is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that all possible single-character moves are considered to find the lexicographically smallest string. This approach is optimal given the constraints and guarantees that the smallest possible string is found.

[Problem]
    You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

    Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

    -----Input-----
    The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
    The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
    The second line contains the string S.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
    - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
    - S will consist of uppercase English letters.

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    2
    4
    DCBA
    7
    XYZZYZZ

    Output:
    ADCB
    XYYZZZZ

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
    Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ
