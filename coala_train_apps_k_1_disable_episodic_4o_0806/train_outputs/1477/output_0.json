    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a string consisting of uppercase English letters. We can perform at most one operation where we remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to rearrange the string by moving one character to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order.\n\n2. **Strategy**:\n   - For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.\n   - For each possible rearrangement, check if it results in a lexicographically smaller string than the current smallest found.\n   - Keep track of the smallest string found during this process.\n\n3. **Optimization Insight**:\n   - The best move is often, the best way to achieve this is to move the smallest character to the front of the string. \n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. For each test case, read the string.\n2. Identify the smallest character in the string.\n3. If the smallest character is not already at the beginning of the string, remove it from its current position and insert it at the beginning.\n4. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest character, move the first occurrence.\n5. Output the modified string for each test case.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N = test_case[0]\n        S = test_case[1]\n        \n        # Find the smallest character in the string\n        smallest_char = min(S)\n        \n        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character\n        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)\n        \n        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start\n        if index_of_smallest != 0:\n            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]\n        \n        # Output the result for this test case\n        print(S)\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N = test_case[0]\n        S = test_case[1]\n        \n        # Find the smallest character in the string\n        smallest_char = min(S)\n        \n        # Find the first occurrence of the smallest character\n        index_of_smallest = S.index(smallest_char)\n        \n        # If the smallest character is not at the start, move it to the start\n        if index_of_smallest != 0:\n            S = smallest_char + S[:index_of_smallest] + S[index_of_smallest+1:]\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(S)\n    \n    # Output all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 2\n# test_cases = [(4, \"DCBA\"), (7, \"XYZZYZZ\")]\n# find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis code reads the number of test cases and each string, finds the smallest character in each string, and moves it to the front if it's not already there. It then prints the lexicographically smallest string for each test case.",
