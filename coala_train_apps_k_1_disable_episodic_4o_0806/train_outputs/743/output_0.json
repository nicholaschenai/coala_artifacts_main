    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe have two candidates who can distribute apples into boxes in different ways. Given `N` apples and `K` boxes, where `N` is divisible by `K`, we need to determine if the final distribution of apples in the boxes can differ based on which candidate is hired. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate places all apples into a single box at a time. We need to decide if these two methods can result in different distributions.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Distribution Methods:**\n   - **First Candidate:** Distributes apples evenly, so each box will have `N/K` apples.\n   - **Second Candidate:** Places all `K` apples into one box at a time, potentially leading to one box having all `N` apples and others having none.\n\n2. **Determine When Distributions Differ:**\n   - If `K` equals `N`, the second candidate can place all apples into one box, resulting in a different distribution than the first candidate.\n   - If `K` is less than `N`, the second candidate will eventually fill all boxes evenly, matching the distribution of the first candidate.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The distributions will differ if and only if `K` equals `N`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction determine_distribution_difference(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K = test_case\n        if K == N:\n            print \"YES\"\n        else:\n            print \"NO\"\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef determine_distribution_difference():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        # If K equals N, the distributions can be different\n        if K == N:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input directly from standard input, processes each test case, and determines if the distributions can differ based on the described logic. The results are then printed for each test case.",
