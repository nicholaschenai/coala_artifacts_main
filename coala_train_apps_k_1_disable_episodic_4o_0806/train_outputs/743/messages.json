He ordered $N$ apples, where $N$ is a multiple of $K$. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. \nOnly two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put $K$ apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts $K$ apples in it.\nChef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?\nNote: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. \n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \"YES\" if the final distributions of apples can be different or \"NO\" if they will be the same (without quotes).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 250$\n- $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^{18}$\n- $N$ is divisible by $K$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (30 points): $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\n5 1\n4 2\n10 10\n\n-----Example Output-----\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: No matter who is hired, all apples will be in the only box at the end.\nExample case 2: At the end, there will be two apples in each box.\nExample case 3: If we hire the first candidate, there will be one apple in each box, but if we hire the second one, there will be $10$ apples in one box and none in all other boxes.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

If \\( N \\) is divisible by \\( K \\), each box will have \\( \\frac{N}{K} \\) apples.\n   - The second candidate will put all \\( K \\) apples into one box at a time.

Thus, the distributions will be different.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - If \\( K = 1 \\), output \"NO\".\n   - If \\( K > 1 \\), output \"YES\".\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction determine_distribution_difference(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K = test_case\n        if K == 1:\n            print \"NO\"\n        else:\n            print \"YES\"\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef determine_distribution_difference(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate over each test case\n    for N, K in test_cases:\n        # If there is only one box, both candidates will result in the same distribution\n        if K == 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            # If there are more than one box, the distributions will be different\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# First value is the number of test cases\nT = int(data[0])\n\n# Prepare the test cases\ntest_cases = []\nindex = 1\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    K = int(data[index + 1])\n    test_cases.append((N, K))\n    index += 2\n\n# Determine the distribution difference for each test case\ndetermine_distribution_difference(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case, and determines if the distribution of apples can be different based on the candidate hired.

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output.
