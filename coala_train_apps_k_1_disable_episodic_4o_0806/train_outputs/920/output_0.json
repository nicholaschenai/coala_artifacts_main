    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a line of students represented by a string where 'b' stands for a boy and 'g' stands for a girl. The awkwardness of the line is defined as the sum of distances between each boy and girl. We need to rearrange the students to minimize this awkwardness. We are given multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to find the minimum possible awkwardness.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To minimize the awkwardness, we should group all boys together and all girls together. This way, the distance between any boy and any girl is minimized. The minimum awkwardness can be calculated by multiplying the number of boys by the number of girls, as each boy will be paired with each girl exactly once.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n       count_boys = count of 'b' in s\n       count_girls = count of 'g' in s\n       return count_boys * count_girls\n\n   function main():\n       read T (number of test cases)\n       for each test case:\n           read string s\n           result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    # Count the number of boys ('b') in the string\n    count_boys = s.count('b')\n    # Count the number of girls ('g') in the string\n    count_girls = s.count('g')\n    # The minimum awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and girls\n    return count_boys * count_girls\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each test case\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        s = data[i]\n        # Calculate the minimum awkwardness for the current test case\n        result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n        # Store the result\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Output all results, one per line\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the minimum awkwardness by counting the number of boys and girls and using their product, which is optimal for minimizing the awkwardness. The solution handles multiple test cases and outputs the result for each.",
