    "raw_msg": "Let's address the issue with the solution for minimizing awkwardness. The key insight is that the minimum awkwardness is achieved by grouping all boys together and all girls together, and the awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and the number of girls.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    # Count the number of boys ('b') in the string\n    count_boys = s.count('b')\n    # Count the number of girls ('g') in the string\n    count_girls = s.count('g')\n    # The minimum awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and girls\n    return count_boys * count_girls\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each test case\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        s = data[i]\n        # Calculate the minimum awkwardness for the current test case\n        result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n        # Store the result\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Output all results, one per line\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code reads multiple test cases, calculates the minimum awkwardness for each by counting the number of boys and girls, and outputs the result. The logic is based on the understanding that the optimal arrangement is to group all boys and all girls together, minimizing the pairwise distances.",
