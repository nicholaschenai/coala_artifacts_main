Today, during the morning prayer, all the students are standing in a line. You are given a string $s$ with length $N$; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of this string is 'b' if the $i$-th student in the line is a boy or 'g' if this student is a girl.\nThe awkwardness of this configuration of students is defined as the sum of pairwise distances between each boy and girl. The distance between the $i$-th and $j$-th student in the line is $|i - j|$. Formally, the awkwardness is \u2211i=1N\u2211j=i+1sj\u2260siN(j\u2212i).\u2211i=1N\u2211j=i+1sj\u2260siN(j\u2212i).\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N \\, \\sum\\limits_{j=i+1\\\\ s_j \\neq s_i}^N (j - i)\\,.\nAs the teacher, it is your responsibility to reorder the students in such a way that the awkwardness of the resulting configuration is the smallest possible. You may reorder the students in the line in any way you want. Find the minimum awkwardness that can be achieved.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $s$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum possible awkwardness.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le |s| \\le 10^5$\n- each character of $s$ is either 'b' or 'g'\n- the sum of $|s|$ over all test cases does not exceed $4 \\cdot 10^6$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\ngb\nbgg\nbbgg\n\n-----Example Output-----\n1\n2\n6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: The total awkwardness is $|1 - 0| = 1$, no matter how you arrange the students.\nExample case 2: Initially, the awkwardness is $|1 - 0| + |2 - 0| = 1 + 2 = 3$. However, you can move the boy between the two girls, i.e. choose the configuration \"gbg\". Here, the awkwardness is $|1 - 0| + |2 - 1| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe have a line of students represented by a string where each character is either 'b' (for a boy) or 'g' (for a girl). The awkwardness of this line is defined as the sum of the distances between each boy and each girl. Our task is to reorder the students to minimize this awkwardness. We need to determine the minimum possible awkwardness for each test case.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo minimize the awkwardness, we should aim to place all boys together and all girls together. This is because the distance between any boy and any girl is minimized when they are grouped together. The minimum awkwardness can be calculated by multiplying the number of boys by the number of girls, as each boy will have a distance of 1 to each girl when they are adjacent.\n\n### Steps:\n1. For each test case, count the number of boys ('b') and girls ('g') in the string.\n2. Calculate the minimum awkwardness as the product of the number of boys and the number of girls.\n3. Output the result for each test case.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate_minimum_awkwardness(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each string s in test_cases:\n        count_b = count of 'b' in s\n        count_g = count of 'g' in s\n        minimum_awkwardness = count_b * count_g\n        append minimum_awkwardness to results\n    return results\n\nread number of test cases T\nread each test case string into a list test_cases\nresults = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(test_cases)\nfor each result in results:\n    print result\n```\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for s in test_cases:\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_g = s.count('g')\n        # The minimum awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and girls\n        minimum_awkwardness = count_b * count_g\n        results.append(minimum_awkwardness)\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = data[1:T+1]\n    \n    results = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- The `calculate_minimum_awkwardness` function takes a list of test case strings and calculates the minimum awkwardness for each.\n- For each string, it counts the number of 'b's and 'g's, then calculates the product of these counts to determine the minimum awkwardness.\n- The `main` function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results. It uses `sys.stdin.read` for efficient input handling, especially given the constraints."

The core concept was to optimize the use of white and black buttons to adjust planned and completed tasks, respectively, while adhering to constraints.\n\n    ### Key Learnings:\n\n    1. **Button Usage Logic**: Initially, I attempted to use multiple buttons per day, which was incorrect as the problem constraints allowed only one button per day. The correct approach was to use the largest possible button effect that fits the constraints for each day.\n\n    2. **Constraints Handling**: A critical error was allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, leading to negative uncompleted tasks. This was fixed by ensuring that any increase in completed tasks with a black button did not surpass the planned tasks.\n\n    3. **Iterative Approach**: The solution required iterating over each day and applying the best possible button effect. Sorting the buttons in descending order helped in prioritizing the largest impact first.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n\n    ```python\n    def minimize_uncompleted_tasks():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, M = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n            index += 3\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n            index += N\n            B = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n            index += N\n            C = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+K]), reverse=True)\n            index += K\n            D = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+M]), reverse=True)\n            index += M\n        \n            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n            for i in range(N):\n                for c in C:\n                    if A[i] >= c:\n                        A[i] -= c\n                        break  # Use only one white button per day\n        \n            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n            for i in range(N):\n                for d in D:\n                    if B[i] + d <= A[i]:\n                        B[i] += d\n                        break  # Use only one black button per day\n        \n            total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))\n            results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    minimize_uncompleted_tasks()\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n\n    The problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and optimizing within them. It also highlighted the need for careful handling of input/output and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem's requirements. Future attempts should focus on verifying constraints and iterating through possible solutions efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The core concept was to optimize the use of white and black buttons to adjust planned and completed tasks, respectively, while adhering to constraints.\n\n    ### Key Learnings:\n\n    1. **Button Usage Logic**: Initially, I attempted to use multiple buttons per day, which was incorrect as the problem constraints allowed only one button per day. The correct approach was to use the largest possible button effect that fits the constraints for each day.\n\n    2. **Constraints Handling**: A critical error was allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, leading to negative uncompleted tasks. This was fixed by ensuring that any increase in completed tasks with a black button did not surpass the planned tasks.\n\n    3. **Iterative Approach**: The solution required iterating over each day and applying the best possible button effect. Sorting the buttons in descending order helped in prioritizing the largest impact first.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n\n    ```python\n    def minimize_uncompleted_tasks():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, M = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n            index += 3\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n            index += N\n            B = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n            index += N\n            C = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+K]), reverse=True)\n            index += K\n            D = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+M]), reverse=True)\n            index += M\n        \n            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n            for i in range(N):\n                for c in C:\n                    if A[i] >= c:\n                        A[i] -= c\n                        break  # Use only one white button per day\n        \n            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n            for i in range(N):\n                for d in D:\n                    if B[i] + d <= A[i]:\n                        B[i] += d\n                        break  # Use only one black button per day\n        \n            total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))\n            results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    minimize_uncompleted_tasks()\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n\n    The problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and optimizing within them. It also highlighted the need for careful handling of input/output and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem's requirements. Future attempts should focus on verifying constraints and iterating through possible solutions efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output.

The test case `bbgg` was expected to yield an awkwardness of 6, but the code outputted 4 due to a miscalculation.
