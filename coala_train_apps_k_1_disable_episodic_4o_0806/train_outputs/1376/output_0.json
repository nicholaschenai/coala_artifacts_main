    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nSalmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold a fixed number of ducks, and each box can contain at most two different colors of ducks. Given the number of ducks of each color, we need to determine how to distribute them into the boxes according to these rules.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors (N), the capacity of each box (K), and the list of duck counts for each color.\n\n2. **Distribution Strategy**:\n   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks.\n   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes with as many ducks of that color as possible.\n   - If a box cannot be completely filled with one color, use another color to fill the remaining space, ensuring no more than two colors per box.\n\n3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks of each color in the box.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N, K, and duck_counts\n        initialize a list to store the result for each box\n        while there are ducks left to distribute:\n            find the color with the most ducks\n            fill the current box with as many ducks of this color as possible\n            if the box is not full:\n                find another color to fill the remaining space\n            record the colors and counts for the current box\n        output the result for each box\n```\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K, duck_counts = case\n        boxes = []\n        \n        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs\n        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]\n        \n        # While there are ducks to distribute\n        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:\n            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending\n            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])\n            \n            # Take the color with the most ducks\n            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]\n            if m1 > K:\n                # If we can fill the box with this color alone\n                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))\n                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color\n                remaining_space = K - m1\n                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)\n                \n                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space\n                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]\n                if m2 >= remaining_space:\n                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))\n                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)\n                else:\n                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))\n                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)\n        \n        results.append(boxes)\n    \n    # Output results\n    for boxes in results:\n        for box in boxes:\n            print(f\"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 1\n# test_cases = [(2, 4, [3, 4, 1])]\n# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads the input, processes each test case by distributing ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the configuration of each box. The greedy approach ensures that each box is filled optimally with at most two colors.",
