One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.\nEach rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.\nSalmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.\nPlease help Salmon achieve this goal!\n\nIt can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   \n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   \n- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   \n- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \\leq i \\leq N$\n\n-----Output:-----\n- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. \n- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \\leq m1,m2 \\leq K$ and $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$. \n- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$.\n- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $T=10$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$ \n- $2 \\leq K \\leq 10^5$ \n- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$\n- There can be a color with $0$ ducks\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \\leq N \\leq 10$, $K=2$ \n- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$\n- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n2 4\n3 4 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n2 1 1 3\n1 1 0 3\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   \n- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   \n- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The solution should handle input parsing and output formatting correctly.\n\n2. **Distribution Logic**: The solution should correctly distribute ducks into boxes, ensuring each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity.\n\n### Solution Review\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: The solution should read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of colors, the capacity of each box, and the list of duck counts.\n\n2. **Distribution Logic**:\n   - The solution should iterate over the list of duck counts, filling each box with as many ducks of one color as possible.\n   - If a box cannot be filled with one color, it should use another color to fill the remaining space.\n   - The solution should ensure that no more than two colors are used per box.\n\n3. **Output**: The solution should output the configuration of each box for each test case.\n\n### Issues in the Current Solution\n\n1. **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is defined but not called. This means the logic inside the function is not executed.\n\n2. **Input/Output Handling**: The solution should read from standard input and write to standard output, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.\n\n3. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met.

Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\nLet's revise the solution to address these issues:\n\n```python\ndef distribute_ducks():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))\n        index += N + 1\n        \n        boxes = []\n        \n        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs\n        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]\n        \n        # While there are ducks to distribute\n        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:\n            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending\n            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])\n            \n            # Take the color with the most ducks\n            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]\n            if m1 > 0:\n                if m1 >= K:\n                    # If we can fill the box with this color alone\n                    boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))\n                    color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)\n                else:\n                    # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color\n                    remaining_space = K - m1\n                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)\n                    \n                    # Find the next color to fill the remaining space\n                    c2, m2 = color_counts[1]\n                    if m2 >= remaining_space:\n                        boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))\n                        color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)\n                    else:\n                        boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))\n                        color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)\n        \n        results.append(boxes)\n    \n    # Output results\n    for boxes in results:\n        for box in boxes:\n            print(f\"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}\")\n\n# Call the function to execute\ndistribute_ducks()\n```\n\n### Key Changes\n\n- **Distribution Logic**: The logic now ensures that the boxes are filled optimally by always trying to fill with the most available color first, and then using another color if needed.\n- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each box's configuration is output correctly. This should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement."

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This requires a greedy approach to ensure optimal distribution while respecting the constraints.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\nInitially, the strategy was to sort the colors by the number of ducks available and fill each box with as many ducks of the most abundant color as possible. If a box couldn't be filled with one color, a second color was used to fill the remaining space. This approach seemed logical but failed to produce the expected output due to incorrect handling of the distribution logic and output format.\n\n#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\nThe main issue was the incorrect distribution of ducks into boxes, which did not match the expected output format. The solution failed to ensure that the boxes were filled optimally and that the output was formatted correctly. The function was correctly implemented but needed adjustments in the logic to ensure that the distribution met the problem's requirements. The solution also needed to ensure that the function was called and executed properly.\n\nIn future attempts, it would be beneficial to:\n- Double-check the logic for distributing items to ensure it aligns with the problem's constraints.\n- Verify the output format against the expected results to ensure compliance.\n- Ensure that the function is executed and that input/output handling is correctly implemented."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem requires distributing ducks into boxes such that each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity. The constraints ensure that a solution is always possible, which is crucial for designing the algorithm.\n\n2. **Greedy Approach**: Both my initial attempts and the official solution use a greedy approach to fill the boxes. The idea is to always try to fill a box with as many ducks of one color as possible, and then use another color if needed. This approach is effective given the constraints.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes specific handling for the case where `N=2` and `K=5`. This suggests that certain configurations might require special handling to ensure the solution is valid. My initial solution did not account for such specific cases, which could lead to incorrect outputs.\n\n4. **Index Mapping**: The official solution uses a dictionary to map the original indices of colors after sorting. This ensures that the output reflects the original color indices, which is a detail I overlooked. This mapping is crucial for maintaining the correct output format.\n\n5. **Iterative Filling**: The official solution iteratively fills each box, checking if the current color can fill the box entirely or if another color is needed. This iterative process ensures that all ducks are distributed correctly across the boxes.\n\n### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Attention to Detail**: Ensuring that the output format matches the expected results is crucial. This includes maintaining the original indices of colors, which can be easily overlooked.\n  \n- **Special Cases**: Handling special cases explicitly can be necessary, especially when constraints suggest that certain configurations might be problematic.\n\n- **Greedy Strategy**: A greedy strategy is often effective for distribution problems, but it must be implemented carefully to handle all edge cases and constraints.\n\nIn summary, the official solution provides a robust approach to solving the problem by carefully managing the distribution of ducks and maintaining the correct output format. This experience highlights the importance of considering edge cases and ensuring that all problem constraints are met."
