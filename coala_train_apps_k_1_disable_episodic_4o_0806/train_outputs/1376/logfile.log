[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. There are `N+1` different colors, and Salmon wants to distribute these ducks into `N` boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and each box can contain ducks of at most two different colors. The task is to determine a valid way to distribute the ducks into the boxes according to these rules.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the box capacity `K`, and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a list to keep track of the number of ducks remaining for each color.
   - For each box, try to fill it with ducks from at most two different colors.
   - Prioritize using colors with the most ducks to ensure that we can fill the boxes efficiently.
   - If a color has more ducks than can fit in a box, fill the box with as many as possible and move to the next box.
   - If a color has fewer ducks than needed to fill a box, use another color to fill the remaining space.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors used and the number of ducks of each color.

## Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = test_case
        boxes = []
        remaining_ducks = list of (color, count) pairs from duck_counts
        sort remaining_ducks by count descending
        
        for i from 0 to N-1:
            box = []
            fill_count = 0
            
            while fill_count < K:
                color, count = remaining_ducks[0]
                if count > 0:
                    take = min(count, K - fill_count)
                    box.append((color, take))
                    fill_count += take
                    remaining_ducks[0] = (color, count - take)
                
                if remaining_ducks[0][1] == 0:
                    remove first element from remaining_ducks
            
            if len(box) == 1:
                box.append((0, 0))  # Add a dummy color if only one color is used
            
            boxes.append(box)
        
        for box in boxes:
            output box as four integers: c1, m1, c2, m2

```

## Python Code

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = test_case
        boxes = []
        remaining_ducks = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N+1)]
        remaining_ducks.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])  # Sort by count descending
        
        for _ in range(N):
            box = []
            fill_count = 0
            
            while fill_count < K:
                color, count = remaining_ducks[0]
                if count > 0:
                    take = min(count, K - fill_count)
                    box.append((color, take))
                    fill_count += take
                    remaining_ducks[0] = (color, count - take)
                
                if remaining_ducks[0][1] == 0:
                    remaining_ducks.pop(0)
            
            if len(box) == 1:
                box.append((0, 0))  # Add a dummy color if only one color is used
            
            boxes.append(box)
        
        for box in boxes:
            if len(box) == 1:
                c1, m1 = box[0]
                c2, m2 = 0, 0
            else:
                (c1, m1), (c2, m2) = box
            results.append(f"{c1} {m1} {c2} {m2}")
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    K = int(data[index + 1])
    duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index + 2:index + 2 + N + 1]))
    test_cases.append((N, K, duck_counts))
    index += 2 + N + 1

# Get results
results = distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This code reads input, processes each test case to distribute ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the result for each box. Each box is filled with ducks from at most two colors, ensuring that the constraints are met.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:

        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold a fixed number of ducks, and each box can contain at most two different colors of ducks. Given the number of ducks of each color, we need to determine how to distribute them into the boxes according to these rules.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors (N), the capacity of each box (K), and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes with as many ducks of that color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be completely filled with one color, use another color to fill the remaining space, ensuring no more than two colors per box.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks of each color in the box.

## Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, and duck_counts
        initialize a list to store the result for each box
        while there are ducks left to distribute:
            find the color with the most ducks
            fill the current box with as many ducks of this color as possible
            if the box is not full:
                find another color to fill the remaining space
            record the colors and counts for the current box
        output the result for each box
```

## Python Solution

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = case
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [(2, 4, [3, 4, 1])]
# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case by distributing ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the configuration of each box. The greedy approach ensures that each box is filled optimally with at most two colors.

 ## Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold a fixed number of ducks, and each box can contain at most two different colors of ducks. Given the number of ducks of each color, we need to determine how to distribute them into the boxes according to these rules.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors (N), the capacity of each box (K), and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes with as many ducks of that color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be completely filled with one color, use another color to fill the remaining space, ensuring no more than two colors per box.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks of each color in the box.

## Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, and duck_counts
        initialize a list to store the result for each box
        while there are ducks left to distribute:
            find the color with the most ducks
            fill the current box with as many ducks of this color as possible
            if the box is not full:
                find another color to fill the remaining space
            record the colors and counts for the current box
        output the result for each box
```

## Python Solution

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = case
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [(2, 4, [3, 4, 1])]
# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case by distributing ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the configuration of each box. The greedy approach ensures that each box is filled optimally with at most two colors.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases from standard input and outputting results to standard output. The solution should handle input parsing and output formatting correctly.

2. **Distribution Logic**: The solution should correctly distribute ducks into boxes, ensuring each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity.

### Solution Review

1. **Input Parsing**: The solution should read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of colors, the capacity of each box, and the list of duck counts.

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The solution should iterate over the list of duck counts, filling each box with as many ducks of one color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be filled with one color, it should use another color to fill the remaining space.
   - The solution should ensure that no more than two colors are used per box.

3. **Output**: The solution should output the configuration of each box for each test case.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is defined but not called. This means the logic inside the function is not executed.

2. **Input/Output Handling**: The solution should read from standard input and write to standard output, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python
def distribute_ducks():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))
        index += N + 1
        
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Call the function to execute
distribute_ducks()
```

### Key Changes

- **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is now called at the end of the script to ensure it executes.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`, and the data is split into manageable parts.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each box's configuration is output correctly.

Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold a fixed number of ducks, and each box can contain at most two different colors of ducks. Given the number of ducks of each color, we need to determine how to distribute them into the boxes according to these rules.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors (N), the capacity of each box (K), and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes with as many ducks of that color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be completely filled with one color, use another color to fill the remaining space, ensuring no more than two colors per box.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks of each color in the box.

## Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, and duck_counts
        initialize a list to store the result for each box
        while there are ducks left to distribute:
            find the color with the most ducks
            fill the current box with as many ducks of this color as possible
            if the box is not full:
                find another color to fill the remaining space
            record the colors and counts for the current box
        output the result for each box
```

## Python Solution

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = case
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [(2, 4, [3, 4, 1])]
# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case by distributing ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the configuration of each box. The greedy approach ensures that each box is filled optimally with at most two colors.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases from standard input and outputting results to standard output. The solution should handle input parsing and output formatting correctly.

2. **Distribution Logic**: The solution should correctly distribute ducks into boxes, ensuring each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity.

### Solution Review

1. **Input Parsing**: The solution should read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of colors, the capacity of each box, and the list of duck counts.

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The solution should iterate over the list of duck counts, filling each box with as many ducks of one color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be filled with one color, it should use another color to fill the remaining space.
   - The solution should ensure that no more than two colors are used per box.

3. **Output**: The solution should output the configuration of each box for each test case.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is defined but not called. This means the logic inside the function is not executed.

2. **Input/Output Handling**: The solution should read from standard input and write to standard output, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python
def distribute_ducks():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))
        index += N + 1
        
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Call the function to execute
distribute_ducks()
```

### Key Changes

- **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is now called at the end of the script to ensure it executes.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`, and the data is split into manageable parts.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each box's configuration is output correctly.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

### Key Changes

- **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is now called at the end of the script to ensure it executes.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`, and the data is split into manageable parts.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each box's configuration is output correctly. This should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold a fixed number of ducks, and each box can contain at most two different colors of ducks. Given the number of ducks of each color, we need to determine how to distribute them into the boxes according to these rules.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors (N), the capacity of each box (K), and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes with as many ducks of that color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be completely filled with one color, use another color to fill the remaining space, ensuring no more than two colors per box.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks of each color in the box.

## Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, and duck_counts
        initialize a list to store the result for each box
        while there are ducks left to distribute:
            find the color with the most ducks
            fill the current box with as many ducks of this color as possible
            if the box is not full:
                find another color to fill the remaining space
            record the colors and counts for the current box
        output the result for each box
```

## Python Solution

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = case
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [(2, 4, [3, 4, 1])]
# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case by distributing ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the configuration of each box. The greedy approach ensures that each box is filled optimally with at most two colors.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases from standard input and outputting results to standard output. The solution should handle input parsing and output formatting correctly.

2. **Distribution Logic**: The solution should correctly distribute ducks into boxes, ensuring each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity.

### Solution Review

1. **Input Parsing**: The solution should read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of colors, the capacity of each box, and the list of duck counts.

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The solution should iterate over the list of duck counts, filling each box with as many ducks of one color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be filled with one color, it should use another color to fill the remaining space.
   - The solution should ensure that no more than two colors are used per box.

3. **Output**: The solution should output the configuration of each box for each test case.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is defined but not called. This means the logic inside the function is not executed.

2. **Input/Output Handling**: The solution should read from standard input and write to standard output, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Key Changes

- **Distribution Logic**: The logic now ensures that the boxes are filled optimally by always trying to fill with the most available color first, and then using another color if needed.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each box's configuration is output correctly. This should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold a fixed number of ducks, and each box can contain at most two different colors of ducks. Given the number of ducks of each color, we need to determine how to distribute them into the boxes according to these rules.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors (N), the capacity of each box (K), and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes with as many ducks of that color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be completely filled with one color, use another color to fill the remaining space, ensuring no more than two colors per box.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks of each color in the box.

## Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, and duck_counts
        initialize a list to store the result for each box
        while there are ducks left to distribute:
            find the color with the most ducks
            fill the current box with as many ducks of this color as possible
            if the box is not full:
                find another color to fill the remaining space
            record the colors and counts for the current box
        output the result for each box
```

## Python Solution

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = case
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [(2, 4, [3, 4, 1])]
# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case by distributing ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the configuration of each box. The greedy approach ensures that each box is filled optimally with at most two colors.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases from standard input and outputting results to standard output. The solution should handle input parsing and output formatting correctly.

2. **Distribution Logic**: The solution should correctly distribute ducks into boxes, ensuring each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity.

### Solution Review

1. **Input Parsing**: The solution should read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of colors, the capacity of each box, and the list of duck counts.

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The solution should iterate over the list of duck counts, filling each box with as many ducks of one color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be filled with one color, it should use another color to fill the remaining space.
   - The solution should ensure that no more than two colors are used per box.

3. **Output**: The solution should output the configuration of each box for each test case.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is defined but not called. This means the logic inside the function is not executed.

2. **Input/Output Handling**: The solution should read from standard input and write to standard output, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Key Changes

- **Distribution Logic**: The logic now ensures that the boxes are filled optimally by always trying to fill with the most available color first, and then using another color if needed.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each box's configuration is output correctly. This should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold a fixed number of ducks, and each box can contain at most two different colors of ducks. Given the number of ducks of each color, we need to determine how to distribute them into the boxes according to these rules.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors (N), the capacity of each box (K), and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes with as many ducks of that color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be completely filled with one color, use another color to fill the remaining space, ensuring no more than two colors per box.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks of each color in the box.

## Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, and duck_counts
        initialize a list to store the result for each box
        while there are ducks left to distribute:
            find the color with the most ducks
            fill the current box with as many ducks of this color as possible
            if the box is not full:
                find another color to fill the remaining space
            record the colors and counts for the current box
        output the result for each box
```

## Python Solution

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = case
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [(2, 4, [3, 4, 1])]
# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case by distributing ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the configuration of each box. The greedy approach ensures that each box is filled optimally with at most two colors.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases from standard input and outputting results to standard output. The solution should handle input parsing and output formatting correctly.

2. **Distribution Logic**: The solution should correctly distribute ducks into boxes, ensuring each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity.

### Solution Review

1. **Input Parsing**: The solution should read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of colors, the capacity of each box, and the list of duck counts.

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The solution should iterate over the list of duck counts, filling each box with as many ducks of one color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be filled with one color, it should use another color to fill the remaining space.
   - The solution should ensure that no more than two colors are used per box.

3. **Output**: The solution should output the configuration of each box for each test case.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is defined but not called. This means the logic inside the function is not executed.

2. **Input/Output Handling**: The solution should read from standard input and write to standard output, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python

            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks

                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]

1. **Distribution Logic**: The current logic does not ensure that the boxes are filled in a way that matches the expected output. The order of colors and the number of ducks per color in each box might not be optimal or expected.

2. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python
def distribute_ducks():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))
        index += N + 1
        
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > 0:
                if m1 >= K:
                    # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                    boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
                else:
                    # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                    remaining_space = K - m1
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                    
                    # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                    c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                    if m2 >= remaining_space:
                        boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                        color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                    else:
                        boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                        color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Call the function to execute
distribute_ducks()
```

### Key Changes

- **Distribution Logic**: The logic now ensures that the boxes are filled optimally by always trying to fill with the most available color first, and then using another color if needed.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each box's configuration is output correctly. This should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold a fixed number of ducks, and each box can contain at most two different colors of ducks. Given the number of ducks of each color, we need to determine how to distribute them into the boxes according to these rules.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors (N), the capacity of each box (K), and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes with as many ducks of that color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be completely filled with one color, use another color to fill the remaining space, ensuring no more than two colors per box.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks of each color in the box.

## Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, and duck_counts
        initialize a list to store the result for each box
        while there are ducks left to distribute:
            find the color with the most ducks
            fill the current box with as many ducks of this color as possible
            if the box is not full:
                find another color to fill the remaining space
            record the colors and counts for the current box
        output the result for each box
```

## Python Solution

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = case
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [(2, 4, [3, 4, 1])]
# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case by distributing ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the configuration of each box. The greedy approach ensures that each box is filled optimally with at most two colors.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases from standard input and outputting results to standard output. The solution should handle input parsing and output formatting correctly.

2. **Distribution Logic**: The solution should correctly distribute ducks into boxes, ensuring each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity.

### Solution Review

1. **Input Parsing**: The solution should read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of colors, the capacity of each box, and the list of duck counts.

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The solution should iterate over the list of duck counts, filling each box with as many ducks of one color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be filled with one color, it should use another color to fill the remaining space.
   - The solution should ensure that no more than two colors are used per box.

3. **Output**: The solution should output the configuration of each box for each test case.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is defined but not called. This means the logic inside the function is not executed.

2. **Input/Output Handling**: The solution should read from standard input and write to standard output, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases from standard input and outputting results to standard output. The solution should handle input parsing and output formatting correctly.

2. **Distribution Logic**: The solution should correctly distribute ducks into boxes, ensuring each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity.

### Solution Review

1. **Input Parsing**: The solution should read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of colors, the capacity of each box, and the list of duck counts.

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The solution should iterate over the list of duck counts, filling each box with as many ducks of one color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be filled with one color, it should use another color to fill the remaining space.
   - The solution should ensure that no more than two colors are used per box.

3. **Output**: The solution should output the configuration of each box for each test case.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Distribution Logic**: The current logic does not ensure that the boxes are filled in a way that matches the expected output. The order of colors and the number of ducks per color in each box might not be optimal or expected.

2. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

# Call the function to execute
distribute_ducks()
```

### Key Changes

- **Distribution Logic**: The logic now ensures that the boxes are filled optimally by always trying to fill with the most available color first, and then using another color if needed.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each box's configuration is output correctly. This should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold a fixed number of ducks, and each box can contain at most two different colors of ducks. Given the number of ducks of each color, we need to determine how to distribute them into the boxes according to these rules.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors (N), the capacity of each box (K), and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes with as many ducks of that color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be completely filled with one color, use another color to fill the remaining space, ensuring no more than two colors per box.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks of each color in the box.

## Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, and duck_counts
        initialize a list to store the result for each box
        while there are ducks left to distribute:
            find the color with the most ducks
            fill the current box with as many ducks of this color as possible
            if the box is not full:
                find another color to fill the remaining space
            record the colors and counts for the current box
        output the result for each box
```

## Python Solution

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = case
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [(2, 4, [3, 4, 1])]
# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case by distributing ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the configuration of each box. The greedy approach ensures that each box is filled optimally with at most two colors.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases from standard input and outputting results to standard output. The solution should handle input parsing and output formatting correctly.

2. **Distribution Logic**: The solution should correctly distribute ducks into boxes, ensuring each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity.

### Solution Review

1. **Input Parsing**: The solution should read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of colors, the capacity of each box, and the list of duck counts.

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The solution should iterate over the list of duck counts, filling each box with as many ducks of one color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be filled with one color, it should use another color to fill the remaining space.
   - The solution should ensure that no more than two colors are used per box.

3. **Output**: The solution should output the configuration of each box for each test case.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is defined but not called. This means the logic inside the function is not executed.

2. **Input/Output Handling**: The solution should read from standard input and write to standard output, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python
def distribute_ducks():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))
        index += N + 1
        
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs

        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone

            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)

        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:

            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

2. **Distribution Logic**: The solution should correctly distribute ducks into boxes, ensuring each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity.

### Solution Review

1. **Input Parsing**: The solution should read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of colors, the capacity of each box, and the list of duck counts.

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The solution should iterate over the list of duck counts, filling each box with as many ducks of one color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be filled with one color, it should use another color to fill the remaining space.
   - The solution should ensure that no more than two colors are used per box.

3. **Output**: The solution should output the configuration of each box for each test case.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Distribution Logic**: The current logic does not ensure that the boxes are filled in a way that matches the expected output. The order of colors and the number of ducks per color in each box might not be optimal or expected.

2. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python
def distribute_ducks():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))
        index += N + 1
        
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > 0:
                if m1 >= K:
                    # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                    boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
                else:
                    # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                    remaining_space = K - m1
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                    
                    # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                    c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                    if m2 >= remaining_space:
                        boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                        color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                    else:
                        boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                        color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Call the function to execute
distribute_ducks()
```

### Key Changes

- **Distribution Logic**: The logic now ensures that the boxes are filled optimally by always trying to fill with the most available color first, and then using another color if needed.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each box's configuration is output correctly. This should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Duck Distribution Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem tests the ability to distribute items (ducks) into containers (boxes) under specific constraints: each box can hold a fixed number of items and can contain at most two distinct types of items. This requires a greedy approach to ensure optimal distribution while respecting the constraints.

#### Strategies and Challenges
Initially, the strategy was to sort the colors by the number of ducks available and fill each box with as many ducks of the most abundant color as possible. If a box couldn't be filled with one color, a second color was used to fill the remaining space. This approach seemed logical but failed to produce the expected output due to incorrect handling of the distribution logic and output format.

#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
The main issue was the incorrect distribution of ducks into boxes, which did not match the expected output format. The solution failed to ensure that the boxes were filled optimally and that the output was formatted correctly. The function was correctly implemented but needed adjustments in the logic to ensure that the distribution met the problem's requirements. The solution also needed to ensure that the function was called and executed properly.

In future attempts, it would be beneficial to:
- Double-check the logic for distributing items to ensure it aligns with the problem's constraints.
- Verify the output format against the expected results to ensure compliance.
- Ensure that the function is executed and that input/output handling is correctly implemented.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold a fixed number of ducks, and each box can contain at most two different colors of ducks. Given the number of ducks of each color, we need to determine how to distribute them into the boxes according to these rules.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors (N), the capacity of each box (K), and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes with as many ducks of that color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be completely filled with one color, use another color to fill the remaining space, ensuring no more than two colors per box.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks of each color in the box.

## Pseudocode

            record the colors and counts for the current box
        output the result for each box
```

## Python Solution

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = case
        boxes = []
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) pairs
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        
        # While there are ducks to distribute
        while sum(count for _, count in color_counts) > 0:
            # Sort colors by the number of ducks available, descending
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
            
            # Take the color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 > K:
                # If we can fill the box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill as much as possible with this color
                remaining_space = K - m1
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                
                # Find the next color to fill the remaining space
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m2 >= remaining_space:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, remaining_space))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - remaining_space)
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, 0)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    # Output results
    for boxes in results:
        for box in boxes:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

# Example usage:
# T = 1
# test_cases = [(2, 4, [3, 4, 1])]
# distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case by distributing ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the configuration of each box. The greedy approach ensures that each box is filled optimally with at most two colors.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input/Output Handling**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases from standard input and outputting results to standard output. The solution should handle input parsing and output formatting correctly.

2. **Distribution Logic**: The solution should correctly distribute ducks into boxes, ensuring each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity.

### Solution Review

1. **Input Parsing**: The solution should read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of colors, the capacity of each box, and the list of duck counts.

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The solution should iterate over the list of duck counts, filling each box with as many ducks of one color as possible.
   - If a box cannot be filled with one color, it should use another color to fill the remaining space.
   - The solution should ensure that no more than two colors are used per box.

3. **Output**: The solution should output the configuration of each box for each test case.

### Issues in the Current Solution

1. **Function Call**: The function `distribute_ducks` is defined but not called. This means the logic inside the function is not executed.

2. **Input/Output Handling**: The solution should read from standard input and write to standard output, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format is not being met. The solution should ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Key Changes

- **Distribution Logic**: The logic now ensures that the boxes are filled optimally by always trying to fill with the most available color first, and then using another color if needed.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each box's configuration is output correctly. This should now correctly handle the input and output as expected by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's address the issues in the previous solution and ensure that the ducks are distributed into boxes correctly.

        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))
        index += N + 1

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:

### Key Insights

1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem requires distributing ducks into boxes such that each box contains at most two colors and is filled to its capacity. The constraints ensure that a solution is always possible, which is crucial for designing the algorithm.

2. **Greedy Approach**: Both my initial attempts and the official solution use a greedy approach to fill the boxes. The idea is to always try to fill a box with as many ducks of one color as possible, and then use another color if needed. This approach is effective given the constraints.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes specific handling for the case where `N=2` and `K=5`. This suggests that certain configurations might require special handling to ensure the solution is valid. My initial solution did not account for such specific cases, which could lead to incorrect outputs.

4. **Index Mapping**: The official solution uses a dictionary to map the original indices of colors after sorting. This ensures that the output reflects the original color indices, which is a detail I overlooked. This mapping is crucial for maintaining the correct output format.

5. **Iterative Filling**: The official solution iteratively fills each box, checking if the current color can fill the box entirely or if another color is needed. This iterative process ensures that all ducks are distributed correctly across the boxes.

### Lessons Learned

- **Attention to Detail**: Ensuring that the output format matches the expected results is crucial. This includes maintaining the original indices of colors, which can be easily overlooked.
  
- **Special Cases**: Handling special cases explicitly can be necessary, especially when constraints suggest that certain configurations might be problematic.

- **Greedy Strategy**: A greedy strategy is often effective for distribution problems, but it must be implemented carefully to handle all edge cases and constraints.

In summary, the official solution provides a robust approach to solving the problem by carefully managing the distribution of ducks and maintaining the correct output format. This experience highlights the importance of considering edge cases and ensuring that all problem constraints are met.
