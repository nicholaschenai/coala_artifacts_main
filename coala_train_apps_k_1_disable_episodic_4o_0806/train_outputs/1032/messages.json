The number of particles at time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. We have multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` modulo `10^6 + 3`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Growth**: \n   - At `t=0`, the number of particles is `X`.\n   - At `t=1`, the number of particles is `1 * X`.\n   - At `t=2`, the number of particles is `2 * (1 * X)`.\n   - At `t=3`, the number of particles is `3 * (2 * (1 * X))`, and so on.\n   - This pattern shows that the number of particles at time `N` is `N! * X`.\n\n2. **Handling Large Numbers**:\n   - Direct computation of factorials for large `N` is not feasible due to size.\n   - We need to compute `N! * X % (10^6 + 3)`.\n   - Use modular arithmetic properties to compute the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3`.\n\n3. **Efficient Computation**:\n   - Use a loop to compute the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` iteratively.\n   - Multiply the result by `X` and take modulo `10^6 + 3`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nMOD = 10^6 + 3\n\nfunction compute_particles(N, X):\n    if N == 0:\n        return X % MOD\n    factorial_mod = 1\n    for i from 1 to N:\n        factorial_mod = (factorial_mod * i) % MOD\n    result = (factorial_mod * X) % MOD\n    return result\n\nread T\nfor each test case:\n    read N, X\n    print compute_particles(N, X)\n```\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef compute_particles(N, X):\n    MOD = 10**6 + 3\n    if N == 0:\n        # If N is 0, the number of particles is simply X\n        return X % MOD\n    \n    factorial_mod = 1\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        factorial_mod = (factorial_mod * i) % MOD\n    \n    result = (factorial_mod * X) % MOD\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        X = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        results.append(compute_particles(N, X))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# The main function will be called when the script is executed\n# It reads from standard input and writes to standard output\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the number of particles at time `N` for each test case, using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers."

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This precomputation allows for quick lookup of factorial values during each test case, significantly reducing the time complexity compared to recalculating the factorial for each test case.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Precomputation of Factorials:**\n   - The solution precomputes the factorials modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\) for all numbers up to 1,000,005. This is stored in a list `a`, where `a[i]` represents \\(i!\\) modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\).\n   - This approach leverages the fact that factorials grow very quickly, and for \\(n \\geq 10^6 + 3\\), the factorial modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\) will be zero due to the properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n2. **Handling Large `n`:**\n   - If `n` is greater than or equal to \\(10^6 + 3\\), the result is directly zero because the factorial will include the modulus as a factor, making the result zero.\n\n3. **Efficiency:**\n   - By precomputing the factorials, the solution reduces the time complexity of each test case to \\(O(1)\\) for factorial lookup and multiplication, making it highly efficient for large numbers of test cases.\n\nThis approach is more efficient than recalculating the factorial for each test case, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \\(10^{18}\\).
