        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe have two students, Ram and Shyam, with roll numbers `A` and `B`. They can only cheat if they receive the same set of questions. The sets of questions are distributed based on the roll number modulo `p`, where `p` is the number of different sets. We need to determine how many values of `p` allow Ram and Shyam to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`. This implies that `A-1` and `B-1` must have the same remainder when divided by `p`.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `A - B = k * p`.\n\n3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The above equation implies that `p` must be a divisor of `|A - B|`. Therefore, the number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A - B|`.\n\n4. **Special Case**: If `A == B`, then `A - B = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to an infinite number of solutions. In this case, we return `-1`.\n\n5. **Iterating Over Test Cases**: For each test case, compute `|A - B|` and count its divisors to determine the number of valid `p` values.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_divisors(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return -1\n    count = 0\n    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            if i != n // i:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\nfunction solve(T, test_cases):\n    for each (A, B) in test_cases:\n        diff = abs(A - B)\n        result = count_divisors(diff)\n        print(result)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    # If n is zero, it means A and B are equal, leading to infinite solutions\n    if n == 0:\n        return -1\n    count = 0\n    # Check divisors up to the square root of n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            # If i is not the square root of n, count the complement divisor\n            if i != n // i:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        A = int(data[index])\n        B = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        diff = abs(A - B)\n        result = count_divisors(diff)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the number of valid `p` values for each case. If `A` equals `B`, it outputs `-1` to indicate infinite solutions."

This involves calculating combinations to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers and using powers of 2 to account for the remaining numbers.\n\n    2. **Efficiency in Computation**: My solution precomputes factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations using the formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\). This approach is efficient for large values of `N` and `K`, as it avoids recalculating factorials for each query. The official solution, however, uses a more direct approach with loops to calculate combinations, which might be less efficient for larger inputs but is straightforward and avoids the need for precomputation.\n\n    3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly handle large numbers by using modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.\n\n    4. **Function Execution**: A key issue in my initial attempts was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output being produced. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed, especially when using functions to encapsulate the solution.\n\n    5. **Input/Output Handling**: The official solution uses `input()` and `print()` for handling input and output, which is straightforward and works well for competitive programming environments. My solution used `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write`, which are efficient for handling large input and output but require careful management of data parsing and function execution.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations, careful handling of input/output, and ensuring that the main logic is executed. The official solution provides a simpler, albeit potentially less efficient, approach to the problem, which can be useful in scenarios where precomputation is not feasible or necessary.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
