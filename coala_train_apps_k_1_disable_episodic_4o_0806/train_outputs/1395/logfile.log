INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have two students, Ram and Shyam, with roll numbers `A` and `B`. They can only cheat if they receive the same set of questions. The sets of questions are distributed based on the roll number modulo `p`, where `p` is the number of different sets. We need to determine how many values of `p` allow Ram and Shyam to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`. This implies that `A-1` and `B-1` must have the same remainder when divided by `p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `A - B = k * p`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The above equation implies that `p` must be a divisor of `|A - B|`. Therefore, the number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A - B|`.

4. **Special Case**: If `A == B`, then `A - B = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to an infinite number of solutions. In this case, we return `-1`.

5. **Iterating Over Test Cases**: For each test case, compute `|A - B|` and count its divisors to determine the number of valid `p` values.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_divisors(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve(T, test_cases):
    for each (A, B) in test_cases:
        diff = abs(A - B)
        result = count_divisors(diff)
        print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_divisors(n):
    # If n is zero, it means A and B are equal, leading to infinite solutions
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    # Check divisors up to the square root of n
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            # If i is not the square root of n, count the complement divisor
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        result = count_divisors(diff)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the number of valid `p` values for each case. If `A` equals `B`, it outputs `-1` to indicate infinite solutions.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Combinatorial Counting**: Both my solution and the official solution rely on combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of subsets where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position. This involves calculating combinations to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers and using powers of 2 to account for the remaining numbers.

    2. **Efficiency in Computation**: My solution precomputes factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations using the formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \). This approach is efficient for large values of `N` and `K`, as it avoids recalculating factorials for each query. The official solution, however, uses a more direct approach with loops to calculate combinations, which might be less efficient for larger inputs but is straightforward and avoids the need for precomputation.

    3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly handle large numbers by using modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.

    4. **Function Execution**: A key issue in my initial attempts was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output being produced. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed, especially when using functions to encapsulate the solution.

    5. **Input/Output Handling**: The official solution uses `input()` and `print()` for handling input and output, which is straightforward and works well for competitive programming environments. My solution used `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write`, which are efficient for handling large input and output but require careful management of data parsing and function execution.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations, careful handling of input/output, and ensuring that the main logic is executed. The official solution provides a simpler, albeit potentially less efficient, approach to the problem, which can be useful in scenarios where precomputation is not feasible or necessary.

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions, and students are assigned sets based on their roll numbers.

Given Ram's roll number `A` and Shyam's roll number `B`, we need to find how many values of `p` allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinite such values, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if the sets they receive are the same, i.e., `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This simplifies to `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The above condition implies that `p` must divide the difference `(A-1) - (B-1)`, which simplifies to `A - B`.

3. **Counting Possible Values of `p`**: 
   - If `A == B`, then `A - B = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to an infinite number of solutions.
   - If `A != B`, we need to count the divisors of `|A - B|`.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A - B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1`.
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A - B|` and output this count.

## Pseudocode

```
function countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read A, B
        if A == B:

            diff = abs(A - B)
            result = countDivisors(diff)

```

## Final Python Solution

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] ## Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called after its definition. In Python scripts, especially when reading from standard input, it's crucial to ensure that the main logic is executed. 

## Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure Function Execution**: The `solve()` function should be called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed when the script runs.

2. **Check Input Handling**: Verify that the input is being read correctly. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()`, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments where input is provided all at once.

3. **Output the Results**: Ensure that the results are being printed correctly. The current implementation collects results in a list and prints them at the end, which is correct.

## Revised Solution

The main issue is that the `solve()` function is not being called. Let's fix this by adding a call to `solve()` at the end of the script.

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        if A == B:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            diff = abs(A - B)
            result = countDivisors(diff)
            results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input handling remains the same, using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once, which is suitable for competitive programming environments.
- **Output**: The results are collected in a list and printed at the end, which is efficient for handling multiple test cases. 

This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

-----Example Input-----
1
2 6

-----Example Output-----
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: They can cheat for $p = 1$, $p = 2$ or $p = 4$.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions, and students are assigned sets based on their roll numbers. Given Ram's roll number `A` and Shyam's roll number `B`, we need to find how many values of `p` allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinite such values, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if the sets they receive are the same, i.e., `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This simplifies to `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The above condition implies that `p` must divide the difference `(A-1) - (B-1)`, which simplifies to `A - B`.

3. **Counting Possible Values of `p`**: 
   - If `A == B`, then `A - B = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to an infinite number of solutions.
   - If `A != B`, we need to count the divisors of `|A - B|`.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A - B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1`.
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A - B|` and output this count.

## Pseudocode

```
function countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that Chef can host given a set of constraints. The core concept involved calculating the total number of problems available and determining how many full contests could be formed, while also considering the limitation of the number of days available.

    Initially, the solution failed because it did not handle input and output correctly for a competitive programming environment. The function was defined but not called, and input was not read from standard input. The key takeaway was the importance of correctly managing input and output, especially in environments where the input is provided all at once and needs to be processed in a structured manner.

    The successful strategy involved reading all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, splitting it into manageable parts, and using an index to track the current position in the input data. This approach ensured that all test cases were processed correctly, and results were printed in the required format. This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the input/output requirements and constraints in competitive programming problems.

Given Ram's roll number `A` and Shyam's roll number `B`, we need to find how many values of `p` allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinite such values, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if the sets they receive are the same, i.e., `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This simplifies to `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The above condition implies that `p` must divide the difference `(A-1) - (B-1)`, which simplifies to `A - B`.

3. **Counting Possible Values of `p`**: 
   - If `A == B`, then `A - B = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to an infinite number of solutions.
   - If `A != B`, we need to count the divisors of `|A - B|`.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A - B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1`.
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A - B|` and output this count.

## Pseudocode

```
function countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read A, B
        if A == B:
            print -1
        else:
            diff = abs(A - B)
            result = countDivisors(diff)
            print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] ## Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` is not being called after its definition. In Python scripts, especially when reading from standard input, it's crucial to ensure that the main logic is executed. 

## Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure Function Execution**: The `solve()` function should be called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed when the script runs.

2. **Check Input Handling**: Verify that the input is being read correctly. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()`, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments where input is provided all at once.

3. **Output the Results**: Ensure that the results are being printed correctly. The current implementation collects results in a list and prints them at the end, which is correct.

## Revised Solution

The main issue is that the `solve()` function is not being called. Let's fix this by adding a call to `solve()` at the end of the script.

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        if A == B:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            diff = abs(A - B)
            result = countDivisors(diff)
            results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input handling remains the same, using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once, which is suitable for competitive programming environments.
- **Output**: The results are collected in a list and printed at the end, which is efficient for handling multiple test cases. 

This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output.

The key insight was recognizing that they can cheat if `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`, which simplifies to `p` dividing the difference `A - B`.

The solution involved:
1. Calculating the absolute difference `|A - B|`.
2. Counting the divisors of this difference to determine the possible values of `p`.
3. Handling the special case where `A == B`, which results in an infinite number of solutions.

A common pitfall was forgetting to call the main function `solve()` after defining it, which led to no output being produced. This was resolved by explicitly calling the function at the end of the script.

The experience reinforced the importance of:
- Simplifying mathematical conditions to identify core constraints.
- Handling edge cases, such as when the difference is zero.
- Ensuring that the main logic is executed by calling the function in scripts that rely on standard input/output. 

The final solution efficiently handles multiple test cases and correctly outputs the number of valid `p` values or `-1` for infinite solutions.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

### Key Insights and Learnings:

1. **Understanding the Condition**: The condition `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` simplifies to `p` dividing `|A - B|`. This was correctly identified in both my solution and the official solution.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If `A == B`, any `p` will work, leading to an infinite number of solutions. This was handled by returning `-1`.

3. **Counting Divisors**: Both solutions correctly count the divisors of `|A - B|` to determine the number of valid `p` values. The approach of iterating up to the square root of the number and checking divisibility is efficient and reduces unnecessary computations.

4. **Function Execution**: My initial solution failed because I did not call the `solve()` function. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the script to execute correctly.

5. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient, with a time complexity of approximately `O(sqrt(n))` for counting divisors, which is suitable given the constraints.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of correctly handling input/output in competitive programming and the efficiency of divisor counting using the square root method. The official solution was similar in logic to my corrected version, confirming the approach was sound.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] The function reads input from standard input, which includes a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers, A and B. It checks if A and B are equal, and if so, appends -1 to the results list. If A and B are not equal, it calculates the absolute difference between A and B, determines the number of divisors of this difference, and appends this count to the results list. Finally, it prints each result from the results list.

You are a helpful assistant that extracts important information from problems and solutions to aid in searchability and education.

## Instructions
- Read through the problem and solution carefully.
- Reason out, step by step, in what scenarios this knowledge would be useful.
- Focus on general patterns and situations to help connect this knowledge to new situations.
- Then, include a list of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair.

## Response format
Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"scenarios": {"description": "In what scenarios will this knowledge be useful? Answer in a paragraph.", "title": "Scenarios", "type": "string"}, "keywords": {"description": "List of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Keywords", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["scenarios", "keywords"]}

[Problem]
    Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
    - The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
    - If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
    Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
    You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 100$
    - $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

    -----Example Input-----
    1
    2 6

    -----Example Output-----
    3

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1: They can cheat for $p = 1$, $p = 2$ or $p = 4$.
