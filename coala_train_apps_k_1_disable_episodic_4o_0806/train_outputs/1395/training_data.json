The key insight is that they can cheat if `p` divides the difference `|A - B|`. \n\n### Key Insights and Learnings:\n\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: The condition `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` simplifies to `p` dividing `|A - B|`. This was correctly identified in both my solution and the official solution.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If `A == B`, any `p` will work, leading to an infinite number of solutions. This was handled by returning `-1`.\n\n3. **Counting Divisors**: Both solutions correctly count the divisors of `|A - B|` to determine the number of valid `p` values. The approach of iterating up to the square root of the number and checking divisibility is efficient and reduces unnecessary computations.\n\n4. **Function Execution**: My initial solution failed because I did not call the `solve()` function. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the script to execute correctly.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient, with a time complexity of approximately `O(sqrt(n))` for counting divisors, which is suitable given the constraints.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of correctly handling input/output in competitive programming and the efficiency of divisor counting using the square root method. The official solution was similar in logic to my corrected version, confirming the approach was sound.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers, A and B. It checks if A and B are equal, and if so, appends -1 to the results list. If A and B are not equal, it calculates the absolute difference between A and B, determines the number of divisors of this difference, and appends this count to the results list. Finally, it prints each result from the results list.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the number of ways two entities can be grouped or matched based on a modular arithmetic condition. Specifically, it applies to situations where you have two distinct identifiers (like roll numbers) and you need to find out how many different group sizes (or sets) would allow these identifiers to fall into the same group. This is common in problems involving cyclic patterns, modular arithmetic, and divisors, such as scheduling, resource allocation, or designing systems with periodic constraints. The solution also highlights the importance of understanding the properties of numbers, such as divisors, and how they relate to modular conditions."
