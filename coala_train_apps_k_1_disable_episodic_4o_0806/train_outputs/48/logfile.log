## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

You are playing a game where you start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. Specifically, you can:
- Trade 1 stick to get `x` sticks.
- Trade `y` sticks to get 1 coal.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches. You have `t` test cases to solve.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.
   - You start with 1 stick.

2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed:**
   - You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals.
   - Total sticks needed = `k + k * y`.

3. **Determine Trades for Sticks:**
   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k + k * y - 1` additional sticks.
   - Each trade for sticks gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick in the trade).
   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{trades\_for\_sticks} = \lceil \frac{k + k \cdot y - 1}{x - 1} \rceil
     \]
   - This can be computed using integer arithmetic as:
     \[
     \text{trades\_for\_sticks} = \frac{k + k \cdot y - 1 + (x - 2)}{x - 1}
     \]

4. **Calculate Trades for Coal:**
   - You need exactly `k` trades to get `k` coals.

5. **Total Trades:**
   - The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coal.

### Pseudocode

```
function minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        x, y, k = test_case
        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y
        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)
        trades_for_coal = k
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal
        append total_trades to results
    return results
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        x, y, k = test_cases[i]
        
        # Calculate total sticks needed
        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y
        
        # Calculate trades needed to get enough sticks
        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)
        
        # Calculate trades needed to get enough coal
        trades_for_coal = k
        
        # Total trades is the sum of both
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal
        
        results.append(total_trades)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# t = 5
# test_cases = [(2, 1, 5), (42, 13, 24), (12, 11, 12), (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000), (2, 1000000000, 1000000000)]
# print(minimum_trades(t, test_cases))
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and their respective parameters, calculates the minimum number of trades needed for each test case, and outputs the results.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of minimizing uncompleted tasks using a time machine with buttons, I encountered several challenges related to button usage logic and constraints handling. The core concept was to optimize the use of white and black buttons to adjust planned and completed tasks, respectively, while adhering to constraints.

    ### Key Learnings:

    1. **Button Usage Logic**: Initially, I attempted to use multiple buttons per day, which was incorrect as the problem constraints allowed only one button per day. The correct approach was to use the largest possible button effect that fits the constraints for each day.

    2. **Constraints Handling**: A critical error was allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, leading to negative uncompleted tasks. This was fixed by ensuring that any increase in completed tasks with a black button did not surpass the planned tasks.

    3. **Iterative Approach**: The solution required iterating over each day and applying the best possible button effect. Sorting the buttons in descending order helped in prioritizing the largest impact first.

    ### Code Snippet:

    ```python
    def minimize_uncompleted_tasks():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K, M = map(int, data[index:index+3])
            index += 3
            A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))
            index += N
            B = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))
            index += N
            C = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+K]), reverse=True)
            index += K
            D = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+M]), reverse=True)
            index += M
        
            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
            for i in range(N):
                for c in C:
                    if A[i] >= c:
                        A[i] -= c
                        break  # Use only one white button per day
        
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            for i in range(N):
                for d in D:
                    if B[i] + d <= A[i]:
                        B[i] += d
                        break  # Use only one black button per day
        
            total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))
            results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    minimize_uncompleted_tasks()
    ```

    ### Conclusion:

    The problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and optimizing within them. It also highlighted the need for careful handling of input/output and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem's requirements. Future attempts should focus on verifying constraints and iterating through possible solutions efficiently.

You are playing a game where you start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks with a wandering trader using two offers: 
1. Exchange 1 stick for `x` sticks.
2. Exchange `y` sticks for 1 coal.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches. You have `t` test cases to solve.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Requirements**: To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. You start with 1 stick.
2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed**: You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals. Thus, you need a total of `k + k * y` sticks.
3. **Determine Trades for Sticks**: 
   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k + k * y - 1` additional sticks.
   - Each trade gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick and gain `x` sticks).
   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks: `(k + k * y - 1) // (x - 1)`.
4. **Calculate Trades for Coals**: You need exactly `k` trades to get `k` coals.
5. **Total Trades**: The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coals.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

You are playing a game where you start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks with a wandering trader using two offers: 
1. Exchange 1 stick for `x` sticks.
2. Exchange `y` sticks for 1 coal.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches. You have `t` test cases to solve.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Requirements**: To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. You start with 1 stick.
2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed**: You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals. Thus, you need a total of `k + k * y` sticks.
3. **Determine Trades for Sticks**: 
   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k + k * y - 1` additional sticks.
   - Each trade gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick and gain `x` sticks).
   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks: `(k + k * y - 1) // (x - 1)`.
4. **Calculate Trades for Coals**: You need exactly `k` trades to get `k` coals.
5. **Total Trades**: The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coals.

## Pseudocode

```
function minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        x, y, k = test_case
        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y
        additional_sticks_needed = total_sticks_needed - 1
        trades_for_sticks = (additional_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)
        trades_for_coals = k
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coals
        results.append(total_trades)
    return results
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x, y, k in test_cases:
        # Calculate total sticks needed
        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y
        # Calculate additional sticks needed beyond the initial 1 stick
        additional_sticks_needed = total_sticks_needed - 1
        # Calculate trades needed to get the required sticks
        trades_for_sticks = (additional_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)
        # Calculate trades needed to get the required coals
        trades_for_coals = k
        # Total trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coals
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coals
        results.append(total_trades)
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
t = int(data[0])
test_cases = []
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    x = int(data[index])
    y = int(data[index + 1])
    k = int(data[index + 2])
    test_cases.append((x, y, k))
    index += 3

# Get results
results = minimum_trades(t, test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case to calculate the minimum number of trades needed, and outputs the results.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently calculate the minimum number of trades needed to craft a specified number of torches in a game setting. The problem required understanding the relationship between the number of sticks and coals needed and the trades available to acquire them.

The key insight was to break down the problem into two main parts: acquiring enough sticks and acquiring enough coals. For sticks, the challenge was to determine how many additional sticks were needed beyond the initial one and how many trades were required to achieve that using the given trade offer. For coals, the number of trades was straightforward since each coal required a fixed number of sticks.

The solution involved calculating the total number of sticks needed, determining the additional sticks required, and then using integer division to find the number of trades needed for those sticks. The total number of trades was the sum of trades for sticks and the fixed number of trades for coals.

This problem reinforced the importance of breaking down complex requirements into simpler, manageable calculations and using integer arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently. The solution was implemented successfully, passing all test cases without any errors.

for haaghfj in range(int(input())):
    x,y,k = list(map(int,input().split()))
    print(k + (y * k + k - 1 +x-2) // (x - 1))


INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] The problem was about determining the minimum number of trades needed to craft a certain number of torches given specific trading rules. My approach to solving the problem was quite similar to the official solution, and both passed all test cases successfully.

### Key Insights:

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: Both solutions correctly identified the need for `k` sticks and `k` coals to craft `k` torches. This requires a total of `k + k * y` sticks.

2. **Calculating Trades for Sticks**: The main challenge was to determine how many trades are needed to acquire the necessary sticks. Both solutions used the formula `(total_sticks_needed - 1) // (x - 1)` to calculate the number of trades required to gather the additional sticks, where `total_sticks_needed` is `k + k * y`.

3. **Calculating Trades for Coals**: Both solutions correctly added `k` trades for acquiring `k` coals, as each coal requires a separate trade.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is slightly more concise, using a single line to compute the result for each test case. It combines the calculation of trades for sticks and coals into a single expression, which is efficient and elegant.

### Reflection:

The problem reinforced the importance of breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable parts and using mathematical reasoning to derive the solution. The official solution's concise approach is a good reminder of how mathematical simplification can lead to more elegant code. In future problems, I will aim to simplify expressions where possible to achieve similar conciseness without sacrificing clarity.
