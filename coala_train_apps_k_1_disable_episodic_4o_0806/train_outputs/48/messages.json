You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. Specifically, you can:\n- Trade 1 stick to get `x` sticks.\n- Trade `y` sticks to get 1 coal.\n\nYour goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches. You have `t` test cases to solve.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.\n   - You start with 1 stick.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed:**\n   - You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals.\n   - Total sticks needed = `k + k * y`.\n\n3. **Determine Trades for Sticks:**\n   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k + k * y - 1` additional sticks.\n   - Each trade for sticks gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick in the trade).\n   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{trades\\_for\\_sticks} = \\lceil \\frac{k + k \\cdot y - 1}{x - 1} \\rceil\n     \\]\n   - This can be computed using integer arithmetic as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{trades\\_for\\_sticks} = \\frac{k + k \\cdot y - 1 + (x - 2)}{x - 1}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Trades for Coal:**\n   - You need exactly `k` trades to get `k` coals.\n\n5. **Total Trades:**\n   - The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coal.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        x, y, k = test_case\n        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)\n        trades_for_coal = k\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal\n        append total_trades to results\n    return results\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for i in range(t):\n        x, y, k = test_cases[i]\n        \n        # Calculate total sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y\n        \n        # Calculate trades needed to get enough sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)\n        \n        # Calculate trades needed to get enough coal\n        trades_for_coal = k\n        \n        # Total trades is the sum of both\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal\n        \n        results.append(total_trades)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# t = 5\n# test_cases = [(2, 1, 5), (42, 13, 24), (12, 11, 12), (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000), (2, 1000000000, 1000000000)]\n# print(minimum_trades(t, test_cases))\n```\n\nThis solution reads the number of test cases and their respective parameters, calculates the minimum number of trades needed for each test case, and outputs the results."

The core concept was to optimize the use of white and black buttons to adjust planned and completed tasks, respectively, while adhering to constraints.\n\n    ### Key Learnings:\n\n    1. **Button Usage Logic**: Initially, I attempted to use multiple buttons per day, which was incorrect as the problem constraints allowed only one button per day. The correct approach was to use the largest possible button effect that fits the constraints for each day.\n\n    2. **Constraints Handling**: A critical error was allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, leading to negative uncompleted tasks. This was fixed by ensuring that any increase in completed tasks with a black button did not surpass the planned tasks.\n\n    3. **Iterative Approach**: The solution required iterating over each day and applying the best possible button effect. Sorting the buttons in descending order helped in prioritizing the largest impact first.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n\n    ```python\n    def minimize_uncompleted_tasks():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, M = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n            index += 3\n            A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n            index += N\n            B = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n            index += N\n            C = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+K]), reverse=True)\n            index += K\n            D = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+M]), reverse=True)\n            index += M\n        \n            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n            for i in range(N):\n                for c in C:\n                    if A[i] >= c:\n                        A[i] -= c\n                        break  # Use only one white button per day\n        \n            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n            for i in range(N):\n                for d in D:\n                    if B[i] + d <= A[i]:\n                        B[i] += d\n                        break  # Use only one black button per day\n        \n            total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))\n            results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    minimize_uncompleted_tasks()\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n\n    The problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and optimizing within them. It also highlighted the need for careful handling of input/output and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem's requirements. Future attempts should focus on verifying constraints and iterating through possible solutions efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It computes the number of trades required to acquire these additional sticks and the trades needed for the coals separately.

It involves understanding how to efficiently use limited resources to achieve a goal, which is a common problem in resource management games, supply chain optimization, and economic simulations. The solution demonstrates how to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to reach a target by using a combination of two different types of trades. This can be applied to any situation where you have to balance between acquiring resources and converting them into another form, especially when there are constraints on the number of operations or trades you can perform."
