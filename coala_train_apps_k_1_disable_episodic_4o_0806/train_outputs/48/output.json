    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nYou are playing a game where you start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks with a wandering trader using two offers: \n1. Exchange 1 stick for `x` sticks.\n2. Exchange `y` sticks for 1 coal.\n\nYour goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches. You have `t` test cases to solve.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements**: To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. You start with 1 stick.\n2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed**: You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals. Thus, you need a total of `k + k * y` sticks.\n3. **Determine Trades for Sticks**: \n   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k + k * y - 1` additional sticks.\n   - Each trade gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick and gain `x` sticks).\n   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks: `(k + k * y - 1) // (x - 1)`.\n4. **Calculate Trades for Coals**: You need exactly `k` trades to get `k` coals.\n5. **Total Trades**: The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coals.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        x, y, k = test_case\n        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y\n        additional_sticks_needed = total_sticks_needed - 1\n        trades_for_sticks = (additional_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)\n        trades_for_coals = k\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coals\n        results.append(total_trades)\n    return results\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for x, y, k in test_cases:\n        # Calculate total sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y\n        # Calculate additional sticks needed beyond the initial 1 stick\n        additional_sticks_needed = total_sticks_needed - 1\n        # Calculate trades needed to get the required sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (additional_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)\n        # Calculate trades needed to get the required coals\n        trades_for_coals = k\n        # Total trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coals\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coals\n        results.append(total_trades)\n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nt = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = []\nindex = 1\nfor _ in range(t):\n    x = int(data[index])\n    y = int(data[index + 1])\n    k = int(data[index + 2])\n    test_cases.append((x, y, k))\n    index += 3\n\n# Get results\nresults = minimum_trades(t, test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case to calculate the minimum number of trades needed, and outputs the results.",
