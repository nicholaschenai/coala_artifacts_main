    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number \"N\" for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a different value of \"N\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   For each test case:\n   - Identify all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to \"N\".\n   - These numbers can be represented as 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is \u2264 N.\n   - Calculate the sum of these multiples.\n   - Output the sum for each test case.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Read the number of test cases, T\n   For each test case:\n       Read the integer N\n       Find the largest multiple of 10 that is \u2264 N, call it M\n       Calculate the number of multiples of 10 up to M, which is M // 10\n       Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum:\n           Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2\n           where first term = 10 and last term = M\n       Print the sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n    # Find the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N\n    M = (N // 10) * 10\n    # Calculate the number of multiples of 10 up to M\n    count = M // 10\n    # Calculate the sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series\n    # Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2\n    sum_multiples = count * (10 + M) // 2\n    return sum_multiples\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each test case\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        # Calculate the sum of multiples of 10 for the given N\n        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Output each result on a new line\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code reads multiple test cases, calculates the sum of multiples of 10 for each given \"N\", and outputs the result for each test case. The solution efficiently uses arithmetic series properties to compute the sum.",
