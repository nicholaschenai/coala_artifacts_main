Each test case provides a different value of \"N\". We need to output the sum for each test case on a new line.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   For each test case:\n   - Identify all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to \"N\".\n   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence: 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is \u2264 N.\n   - The largest multiple of 10 that is \u2264 N can be found by calculating `N // 10 * 10`.\n   - The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum} = \\frac{\\text{Number of terms}}{2} \\times (\\text{First term} + \\text{Last term})\n     \\]\n   - The first term is 10, and the last term is the largest multiple of 10 \u2264 N.\n   - The number of terms is the largest multiple of 10 divided by 10.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Read the number of test cases, T\n   For each test case:\n       Read the integer N\n       Calculate the largest multiple of 10 that is \u2264 N: max_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n       Calculate the number of terms: num_terms = max_multiple // 10\n       Calculate the sum using the arithmetic sequence formula:\n           sum = (num_terms / 2) * (10 + max_multiple)\n       Print the sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_multiples_of_10():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each test case\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        # Read the integer N for the current test case\n        N = int(data[i])\n        \n        # Calculate the largest multiple of 10 that is \u2264 N\n        max_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n        \n        # Calculate the number of terms in the sequence\n        num_terms = max_multiple // 10\n        \n        # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence\n        # First term is 10, last term is max_multiple\n        sum_multiples = (num_terms * (10 + max_multiple)) // 2\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(sum_multiples)\n    \n    # Output all results, each on a new line\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code reads input from standard input, processes each test case to calculate the sum of multiples of 10 up to N, and prints the result for each test case. The arithmetic sequence formula is used to efficiently compute the sum."

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "The problem was straightforward, and my solution was similar to the official one. Both approaches efficiently calculate the sum of multiples of 10 up to a given number \"N\" using arithmetic series properties. However, there are a few differences worth noting:\n\n1. **Simplification in Calculation:**\n   - The official solution directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to \"N\" by using `n -= n % 10`. This is a concise way to adjust \"N\" to the nearest lower multiple of 10.\n   - It then divides by 10 to get the count of multiples and uses a single line to compute the sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2 * 10`. This is a more compact expression compared to my approach, which separately calculated the count and then used the arithmetic series formula.\n\n2. **Use of `eval`:**\n   - The official solution uses `eval(input())` to read inputs, which is less safe and generally not recommended due to potential security risks. My solution used `int()` for type conversion, which is safer.\n\n3. **Efficiency and Readability:**\n   - Both solutions are efficient with a time complexity of O(1) per test case, as they perform a constant amount of work regardless of the size of \"N\".\n   - The official solution is slightly more concise, but my solution is arguably more readable due to the explicit steps.\n\nOverall, the problem was simple, and both solutions effectively solve it. The key takeaway is the use of arithmetic series properties to efficiently compute sums of sequences, which is a useful technique in many mathematical problems."
