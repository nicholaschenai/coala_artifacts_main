INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a different value of "N". We need to output the sum for each test case on a new line.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   For each test case:
   - Identify all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to "N".
   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence: 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N.
   - The largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N can be found by calculating `N // 10 * 10`.
   - The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{Number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{First term} + \text{Last term})
     \]
   - The first term is 10, and the last term is the largest multiple of 10 â‰¤ N.
   - The number of terms is the largest multiple of 10 divided by 10.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read the number of test cases, T
   For each test case:
       Read the integer N
       Calculate the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N: max_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
       Calculate the number of terms: num_terms = max_multiple // 10
       Calculate the sum using the arithmetic sequence formula:
           sum = (num_terms / 2) * (10 + max_multiple)
       Print the sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    
    results = []
    
    # Process each test case
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        # Read the integer N for the current test case
        N = int(data[i])
        
        # Calculate the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N
        max_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
        
        # Calculate the number of terms in the sequence
        num_terms = max_multiple // 10
        
        # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence
        # First term is 10, last term is max_multiple
        sum_multiples = (num_terms * (10 + max_multiple)) // 2
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(sum_multiples)
    
    # Output all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads input from standard input, processes each test case to calculate the sum of multiples of 10 up to N, and prints the result for each test case. The arithmetic sequence formula is used to efficiently compute the sum.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The core concept here was recognizing that the multiples of 10 form an arithmetic sequence, which allowed us to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to efficiently compute the result.

Key steps included:
- Identifying the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to "N".
- Calculating the number of such multiples.
- Using the arithmetic series sum formula: \( \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{number of terms} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})}{2} \).

The solution was implemented in Python, reading input from standard input and outputting results for each test case. The approach was efficient, leveraging integer division and arithmetic properties to handle large values of "N" up to 1 billion without performance issues.

This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sequences and using mathematical formulas to simplify calculations, especially when dealing with large input sizes.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 837 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a different value of "N".

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   For each test case:
   - Identify all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to "N".
   - These numbers can be represented as 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N.
   - Calculate the sum of these multiples.
   - Output the sum for each test case.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read the number of test cases, T
   For each test case:
       Read the integer N
       Find the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N, call it M
       Calculate the number of multiples of 10 up to M, which is M // 10
       Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum:
           Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2
           where first term = 10 and last term = M
       Print the sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    # Find the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N
    M = (N // 10) * 10
    # Calculate the number of multiples of 10 up to M
    count = M // 10
    # Calculate the sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series
    # Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2
    sum_multiples = count * (10 + M) // 2
    return sum_multiples

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    # Process each test case
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        # Calculate the sum of multiples of 10 for the given N
        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    # Output each result on a new line
    for res in results:
        print(res)

main()
```

This code reads multiple test cases, calculates the sum of multiples of 10 for each given "N", and outputs the result for each test case. The solution efficiently uses arithmetic series properties to compute the sum.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for t in range(eval(input())):
 n=eval(input())
 n-=n%10
 n/=10
 print(n*(n+1)/2*10)

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution was similar to the official one. Both approaches efficiently calculate the sum of multiples of 10 up to a given number "N" using arithmetic series properties. However, there are a few differences worth noting:

1. **Simplification in Calculation:**
   - The official solution directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to "N" by using `n -= n % 10`. This is a concise way to adjust "N" to the nearest lower multiple of 10.
   - It then divides by 10 to get the count of multiples and uses a single line to compute the sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2 * 10`. This is a more compact expression compared to my approach, which separately calculated the count and then used the arithmetic series formula.

2. **Use of `eval`:**
   - The official solution uses `eval(input())` to read inputs, which is less safe and generally not recommended due to potential security risks. My solution used `int()` for type conversion, which is safer.

3. **Efficiency and Readability:**
   - Both solutions are efficient with a time complexity of O(1) per test case, as they perform a constant amount of work regardless of the size of "N".
   - The official solution is slightly more concise, but my solution is arguably more readable due to the explicit steps.

Overall, the problem was simple, and both solutions effectively solve it. The key takeaway is the use of arithmetic series properties to efficiently compute sums of sequences, which is a useful technique in many mathematical problems.
