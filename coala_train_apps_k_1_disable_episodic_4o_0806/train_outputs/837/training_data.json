    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number \"N\" for multiple test cases. The core concept here was recognizing that the multiples of 10 form an arithmetic sequence, which allowed us to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to efficiently compute the result.\n\nKey steps included:\n- Identifying the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to \"N\".\n- Calculating the number of such multiples.\n- Using the arithmetic series sum formula: \\( \\text{Sum} = \\frac{\\text{number of terms} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})}{2} \\).\n\nThe solution was implemented in Python, reading input from standard input and outputting results for each test case. The approach was efficient, leveraging integer division and arithmetic properties to handle large values of \"N\" up to 1 billion without performance issues.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sequences and using mathematical formulas to simplify calculations, especially when dealing with large input sizes.",
    "reflection": "The problem was straightforward, and my solution was similar to the official one. Both approaches efficiently calculate the sum of multiples of 10 up to a given number \"N\" using arithmetic series properties. However, there are a few differences worth noting:\n\n1. **Simplification in Calculation:**\n   - The official solution directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to \"N\" by using `n -= n % 10`. This is a concise way to adjust \"N\" to the nearest lower multiple of 10.\n   - It then divides by 10 to get the count of multiples and uses a single line to compute the sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2 * 10`. This is a more compact expression compared to my approach, which separately calculated the count and then used the arithmetic series formula.\n\n2. **Use of `eval`:**\n   - The official solution uses `eval(input())` to read inputs, which is less safe and generally not recommended due to potential security risks. My solution used `int()` for type conversion, which is safer.\n\n3. **Efficiency and Readability:**\n   - Both solutions are efficient with a time complexity of O(1) per test case, as they perform a constant amount of work regardless of the size of \"N\".\n   - The official solution is slightly more concise, but my solution is arguably more readable due to the explicit steps.\n\nOverall, the problem was simple, and both solutions effectively solve it. The key takeaway is the use of arithmetic series properties to efficiently compute sums of sequences, which is a useful technique in many mathematical problems.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer. For each test case, it calculates the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to the given integer. It stores the results for each test case in a list and then prints each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to calculate the sum of multiples of a specific number up to a given limit, especially when dealing with large numbers that could cause integer overflow. The problem demonstrates how to efficiently find the sum of multiples of 10 up to a number N using arithmetic series formulas, which can be generalized to other multiples and limits. This is particularly relevant in competitive programming, data analysis, and mathematical computations where performance and accuracy are critical. Understanding how to handle large inputs and avoid overflow is also crucial in software development and algorithm design."
