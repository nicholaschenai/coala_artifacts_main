    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nGiven an array of non-negative integers, we need to find the number of unique results obtained by taking the bitwise OR of all elements in every possible contiguous subarray. Each unique result should be counted only once.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. This means that the result of a bitwise OR operation can only increase or stay the same as we include more elements in the subarray.\n\n2. **Iterative Approach**: We can iterate over the array and for each element, calculate the OR for all subarrays ending at that element. We maintain a set of results to ensure uniqueness.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the OR for each subarray from scratch, we can use the results of previous calculations. For each new element, we can extend the OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element by including the new element.\n\n4. **Set for Uniqueness**: Use a set to store all unique OR results. Sets automatically handle duplicates, so we only need to add each new OR result to the set.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a set `results` to store unique OR results.\n2. Initialize a set `current` to store OR results of subarrays ending at the current element.\n3. For each element `x` in the array:\n   - Update `current` to include OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element extended by `x`.\n   - Add `x` itself to `current` as it represents a subarray of length 1.\n   - Add all elements of `current` to `results`.\n4. Return the size of `results` as the number of unique OR results.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Set to store all unique OR results\n        results = set()\n        # Set to store OR results of subarrays ending at the current element\n        current = set()\n        \n        for x in A:\n            # Update current set with OR results including the new element x\n            current = {y | x for y in current} | {x}\n            # Add all current OR results to the results set\n            results.update(current)\n        \n        # Return the number of unique OR results\n        return len(results)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We use a set `results` to keep track of all unique OR results.\n- For each element `x` in the array, we update the `current` set to include OR results of all subarrays ending at the previous element extended by `x`, and also include `x` itself.\n- We then update the `results` set with all elements from `current`.\n- Finally, we return the size of the `results` set, which gives us the number of unique OR results.",
