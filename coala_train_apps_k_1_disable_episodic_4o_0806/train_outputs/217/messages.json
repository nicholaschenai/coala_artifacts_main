        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given an array `A` of non-negative integers. For every contiguous subarray `B` of `A`, we compute the bitwise OR of all elements in `B`. We need to find out how many unique results we can get from these operations.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. This means that as we extend a subarray, the result of the OR operation can only stay the same or increase.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Subarrays**: We need to consider all possible subarrays. However, instead of recalculating the OR for each subarray from scratch, we can build on the results of previous subarrays.\n\n3. **Use Sets for Uniqueness**: We can use sets to keep track of unique OR results. For each element in the array, we can maintain a set of OR results that can be achieved by extending subarrays ending at that element.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can calculate the OR results by taking the OR of `A[i]` with each result from the previous set of OR results. This way, we efficiently propagate the OR results through the array.\n\n5. **Final Result**: The union of all sets of OR results gives us the unique OR results for all subarrays.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction subarrayBitwiseORs(A):\n    initialize a set `result` to store unique OR results\n    initialize a set `current` to store OR results for subarrays ending at the current element\n\n    for each element `a` in A:\n        initialize a new set `new_current`\n        add `a` to `new_current`\n        for each OR result `x` in `current`:\n            add `x OR a` to `new_current`\n        update `current` to `new_current`\n        add all elements of `current` to `result`\n\n    return the size of `result`\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize a set to store all unique OR results\n        result = set()\n        # Initialize a set to store OR results for subarrays ending at the current element\n        current = set()\n        \n        for a in A:\n            # Start a new set for the current element\n            new_current = {a}\n            # Update the new_current set with OR results from the previous current set\n            for x in current:\n                new_current.add(x | a)\n            # Update the current set to the new_current set\n            current = new_current\n            # Add all elements of the current set to the result set\n            result.update(current)\n        \n        # Return the number of unique OR results\n        return len(result)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to maintain uniqueness. The time complexity is manageable due to the limited number of unique OR results that can be generated from the given constraints."

This is a common technique in competitive programming to handle range sum queries efficiently, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, uses a direct summation approach within each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs due to its O(N) complexity per query.\n\n    2. **Function Execution**: A key mistake in my initial solution was not calling the function that contained the main logic. This oversight led to no output being generated, which is a common pitfall when structuring code in functions without ensuring they are executed.\n\n    3. **Input Handling**: Both my solution and the official solution handle input parsing effectively, but my approach used `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once, which is often more efficient in competitive programming settings where input size can be large.\n\n    4. **Modulo Operation**: The official solution includes a modulo operation with `1000000000` during summation, which was not specified in the problem statement provided. This could be a requirement in some contexts to prevent overflow, but it was not necessary in the problem as I understood it.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient data structures like prefix sums for handling range queries and the necessity of ensuring that all parts of the code, especially function calls, are correctly implemented to produce the desired output.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This means that the result of a bitwise OR operation can only increase or stay the same as we include more elements in the subarray.\n\n2. **Iterative Approach**: We can iterate over the array and for each element, calculate the OR for all subarrays ending at that element.

For each new element, we can extend the OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element by including the new element.\n\n4. **Set for Uniqueness**: Use a set to store all unique OR results. Sets automatically handle duplicates, so we only need to add each new OR result to the set.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a set `results` to store unique OR results.\n2. Initialize a set `current` to store OR results of subarrays ending at the current element.\n3.
