    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine the number of unique results obtained by performing a bitwise OR operation on all possible contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The key concept here is understanding how the bitwise OR operation works and how it can be efficiently applied to subarrays.\n\n### Core Concepts:\n- **Bitwise OR Operation**: This operation results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. This property means that the OR result can only increase or stay the same as more elements are included in the subarray.\n- **Set for Uniqueness**: Using a set to store results ensures that each OR result is counted only once, as sets automatically handle duplicates.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Iterative Approach**: For each element in the array, calculate the OR for all subarrays ending at that element. This is done by extending the OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element with the current element.\n- **Efficiency**: Instead of recalculating the OR for each subarray from scratch, leverage the results of previous calculations to build upon them.\n\n### Solution:\nThe solution involved iterating over the array and maintaining two sets: one for the current OR results (`current`) and another for all unique results (`results`). For each element, update the `current` set with new OR results and add these to the `results` set. Finally, the size of the `results` set gives the number of unique OR results.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n        results = set()\n        current = set()\n        \n        for x in A:\n            current = {y | x for y in current} | {x}\n            results.update(current)\n        \n        return len(results)\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the bitwise OR operation and using sets to manage uniqueness. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency.",
    "reflection": "The problem of finding the number of unique bitwise OR results from all contiguous subarrays of a given array was approached effectively in my initial solution. The official solution provided is quite similar to my approach, with only minor differences in implementation details.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Set Usage for Uniqueness**: Both my solution and the official solution utilize sets to store unique OR results. This is crucial because sets automatically handle duplicates, ensuring that each OR result is counted only once.\n\n2. **Iterative OR Calculation**: The approach of iteratively calculating OR results for subarrays ending at each element is consistent in both solutions. This method efficiently builds upon previous results, avoiding redundant calculations.\n\n3. **Code Simplification**: The official solution uses a slightly more concise way to update the `cur` set by using the `|=` operator, which is a shorthand for updating a set with another set. This is a minor syntactic improvement that makes the code slightly cleaner.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe problem was straightforward, and the solution I devised was aligned with the official solution. The key takeaway is the effective use of sets to manage unique results and the iterative approach to build OR results efficiently. The official solution's use of the `|=` operator is a useful syntactic trick that can make the code more concise without changing its logic. Overall, this problem reinforced the importance of leveraging data structures like sets for problems involving uniqueness and the efficiency of iterative calculations in dynamic scenarios.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThe function calculates the number of distinct bitwise OR results that can be obtained from all possible subarrays of a given list of integers. It iterates through each element in the list, updating a set of current OR results by performing a bitwise OR operation with the current element and all previously computed OR results. This updated set is then added to a results set that accumulates all unique OR outcomes. Finally, the function returns the size of the results set, which represents the count of distinct OR values from all subarrays.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the number of unique results from bitwise operations over subarrays of an array. This can be applied in problems involving bitwise operations, optimization of subarray computations, and understanding the properties of bitwise OR operations. It is particularly relevant in competitive programming and algorithm design where efficient computation of results from subarrays is required, especially given constraints on array size and element values."
