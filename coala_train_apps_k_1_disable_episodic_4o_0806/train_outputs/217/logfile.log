INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array `A` of non-negative integers. For every contiguous subarray `B` of `A`, we compute the bitwise OR of all elements in `B`. We need to find out how many unique results we can get from these operations.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. This means that as we extend a subarray, the result of the OR operation can only stay the same or increase.

2. **Iterate Over Subarrays**: We need to consider all possible subarrays. However, instead of recalculating the OR for each subarray from scratch, we can build on the results of previous subarrays.

3. **Use Sets for Uniqueness**: We can use sets to keep track of unique OR results. For each element in the array, we can maintain a set of OR results that can be achieved by extending subarrays ending at that element.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can calculate the OR results by taking the OR of `A[i]` with each result from the previous set of OR results. This way, we efficiently propagate the OR results through the array.

5. **Final Result**: The union of all sets of OR results gives us the unique OR results for all subarrays.

## Pseudocode

```
function subarrayBitwiseORs(A):
    initialize a set `result` to store unique OR results
    initialize a set `current` to store OR results for subarrays ending at the current element

    for each element `a` in A:
        initialize a new set `new_current`
        add `a` to `new_current`
        for each OR result `x` in `current`:
            add `x OR a` to `new_current`
        update `current` to `new_current`
        add all elements of `current` to `result`

    return the size of `result`
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize a set to store all unique OR results
        result = set()
        # Initialize a set to store OR results for subarrays ending at the current element
        current = set()
        
        for a in A:
            # Start a new set for the current element
            new_current = {a}
            # Update the new_current set with OR results from the previous current set
            for x in current:
                new_current.add(x | a)
            # Update the current set to the new_current set
            current = new_current
            # Add all elements of the current set to the result set
            result.update(current)
        
        # Return the number of unique OR results
        return len(result)
```

This solution efficiently calculates the unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to maintain uniqueness. The time complexity is manageable due to the limited number of unique OR results that can be generated from the given constraints.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, there are several insights and takeaways:

    1. **Prefix Sum Efficiency**: My approach utilized a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of subarrays in constant time. This is a common technique in competitive programming to handle range sum queries efficiently, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, uses a direct summation approach within each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs due to its O(N) complexity per query.

    2. **Function Execution**: A key mistake in my initial solution was not calling the function that contained the main logic. This oversight led to no output being generated, which is a common pitfall when structuring code in functions without ensuring they are executed.

    3. **Input Handling**: Both my solution and the official solution handle input parsing effectively, but my approach used `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once, which is often more efficient in competitive programming settings where input size can be large.

    4. **Modulo Operation**: The official solution includes a modulo operation with `1000000000` during summation, which was not specified in the problem statement provided. This could be a requirement in some contexts to prevent overflow, but it was not necessary in the problem as I understood it.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient data structures like prefix sums for handling range queries and the necessity of ensuring that all parts of the code, especially function calls, are correctly implemented to produce the desired output.

INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

Given an array of non-negative integers, we need to find the number of unique results obtained by taking the bitwise OR of all elements in every possible contiguous subarray. Each unique result should be counted only once.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. This means that the result of a bitwise OR operation can only increase or stay the same as we include more elements in the subarray.

2. **Iterative Approach**: We can iterate over the array and for each element, calculate the OR for all subarrays ending at that element. We maintain a set of results to ensure uniqueness.

3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the OR for each subarray from scratch, we can use the results of previous calculations. For each new element, we can extend the OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element by including the new element.

4. **Set for Uniqueness**: Use a set to store all unique OR results. Sets automatically handle duplicates, so we only need to add each new OR result to the set.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a set `results` to store unique OR results.
2. Initialize a set `current` to store OR results of subarrays ending at the current element.
3. For each element `x` in the array:
   - Update `current` to include OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element extended by `x`.
   - Add `x` itself to `current` as it represents a subarray of length 1.
   - Add all elements of `current` to `results`.
4. Return the size of `results` as the number of unique OR results.

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        # Set to store all unique OR results
        results = set()
        # Set to store OR results of subarrays ending at the current element
        current = set()
        
        for x in A:
            # Update current set with OR results including the new element x

            results.update(current)
        
        # Return the number of unique OR results
        return len(results)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a set `results` to keep track of all unique OR results.
- For each element `x` in the array, we update the `current` set to include OR results of all subarrays ending at the previous element extended by `x`, and also include `x` itself.
- We then update the `results` set with all elements from `current`.

INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the number of unique results obtained by performing a bitwise OR operation on all possible contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The key concept here is understanding how the bitwise OR operation works and how it can be efficiently applied to subarrays.

### Core Concepts:
- **Bitwise OR Operation**: This operation results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. This property means that the OR result can only increase or stay the same as more elements are included in the subarray.
- **Set for Uniqueness**: Using a set to store results ensures that each OR result is counted only once, as sets automatically handle duplicates.

### Strategy:
- **Iterative Approach**: For each element in the array, calculate the OR for all subarrays ending at that element. This is done by extending the OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element with the current element.
- **Efficiency**: Instead of recalculating the OR for each subarray from scratch, leverage the results of previous calculations to build upon them.

### Solution:
The solution involved iterating over the array and maintaining two sets: one for the current OR results (`current`) and another for all unique results (`results`). For each element, update the `current` set with new OR results and add these to the `results` set. Finally, the size of the `results` set gives the number of unique OR results.

```python
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        results = set()

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
We have an array A of non-negative integers.
For every (contiguous) subarray B =Â [A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[j]] (with i <= j), we take the bitwise OR of all the elements in B, obtaining a result A[i] | A[i+1] | ... | A[j].
Return the number of possibleÂ results.Â  (Results that occur more than once are only counted once in the final answer.)
Â 

Example 1:
Input: [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
There is only one possible result: 0.


Example 2:
Input: [1,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The possible subarrays are [1], [1], [2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 1, 2].

INFO - [Task id] 217 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

Given an array of non-negative integers, we need to find the number of unique results obtained by taking the bitwise OR of all elements in every possible contiguous subarray. Each unique result should be counted only once.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1. This means that the result of a bitwise OR operation can only increase or stay the same as we include more elements in the subarray.

2. **Iterative Approach**: We can iterate over the array and for each element, calculate the OR for all subarrays ending at that element. We maintain a set of results to ensure uniqueness.

3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the OR for each subarray from scratch, we can use the results of previous calculations. For each new element, we can extend the OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element by including the new element.

4. **Set for Uniqueness**: Use a set to store all unique OR results. Sets automatically handle duplicates, so we only need to add each new OR result to the set.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a set `results` to store unique OR results.
2. Initialize a set `current` to store OR results of subarrays ending at the current element.
3. For each element `x` in the array:
   - Update `current` to include OR results of subarrays ending at the previous element extended by `x`.
   - Add `x` itself to `current` as it represents a subarray of length 1.
   - Add all elements of `current` to `results`.
4. Return the size of `results` as the number of unique OR results.

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        # Set to store all unique OR results
        results = set()
        # Set to store OR results of subarrays ending at the current element
        current = set()
        
        for x in A:
            # Update current set with OR results including the new element x
            current = {y | x for y in current} | {x}
            # Add all current OR results to the results set
            results.update(current)
        
        # Return the number of unique OR results
        return len(results)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a set `results` to keep track of all unique OR results.
- For each element `x` in the array, we update the `current` set to include OR results of all subarrays ending at the previous element extended by `x`, and also include `x` itself.
- We then update the `results` set with all elements from `current`.
- Finally, we return the size of the `results` set, which gives us the number of unique OR results.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        res = set()
        cur = set()
        for a in A:
            cur = {a | i for i in cur}
            cur |= {a}
            res |= cur
        return len(res)

INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] The problem of finding the number of unique bitwise OR results from all contiguous subarrays of a given array was approached effectively in my initial solution. The official solution provided is quite similar to my approach, with only minor differences in implementation details.

### Key Insights:

1. **Set Usage for Uniqueness**: Both my solution and the official solution utilize sets to store unique OR results. This is crucial because sets automatically handle duplicates, ensuring that each OR result is counted only once.

2. **Iterative OR Calculation**: The approach of iteratively calculating OR results for subarrays ending at each element is consistent in both solutions. This method efficiently builds upon previous results, avoiding redundant calculations.

3. **Code Simplification**: The official solution uses a slightly more concise way to update the `cur` set by using the `|=` operator, which is a shorthand for updating a set with another set. This is a minor syntactic improvement that makes the code slightly cleaner.

### Reflection:

The problem was straightforward, and the solution I devised was aligned with the official solution. The key takeaway is the effective use of sets to manage unique results and the iterative approach to build OR results efficiently. The official solution's use of the `|=` operator is a useful syntactic trick that can make the code more concise without changing its logic. Overall, this problem reinforced the importance of leveraging data structures like sets for problems involving uniqueness and the efficiency of iterative calculations in dynamic scenarios.
