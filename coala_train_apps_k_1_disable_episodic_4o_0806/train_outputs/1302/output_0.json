    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to rooms in two houses. Each box contains a number of tiles equal to its index, and each room has a floor area that is a perfect square. The goal is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, with the constraint that each room must be tiled using tiles from a single box, and the tiles must be distributed equally between two rooms (one in each house).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each box `i`, it contains `i` tiles. We need to find two rooms, one in each house, such that both rooms can be completely tiled using exactly `i/2` tiles each. This means the area of each room must be `i/2`.\n\n2. **Perfect Square Condition**: A room can only be tiled if its area is a perfect square. Therefore, `i/2` must be a perfect square for the tiles from box `i` to be used.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Boxes**: For each box from 1 to N, check if `i/2` is a perfect square. If it is, then two rooms can be tiled (one in each house).\n\n4. **Count the Rooms**: Count the number of such `i` values for which `i/2` is a perfect square. This count will be the number of rooms that can be completely tiled.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction countTiledRooms(T, test_cases):\n    for each N in test_cases:\n        count = 0\n        for i from 1 to N:\n            if i is even:\n                half_i = i / 2\n                if half_i is a perfect square:\n                    count += 2\n        print count\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef countTiledRooms(T, test_cases):\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for t in range(T):\n        N = int(data[t + 1])\n        count = 0\n        i = 2\n        while i * i <= N:\n            count += 2\n            i += 1\n        results.append(count)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `T`, and the subsequent elements are the values of `N` for each test case.\n\n- **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we initialize a count to zero.\n\n- **Iterate Over Possible Perfect Squares**: We iterate over possible perfect squares `i*i` starting from `2*2` (since `1*1` would not allow for two rooms to be tiled) and check if `i*i` is less than or equal to `N`.\n\n- **Count Rooms**: For each valid perfect square, we increment the count by 2 because each perfect square allows for two rooms to be tiled (one in each house).\n\n- **Output Results**: Finally, we print the results for each test case.",
