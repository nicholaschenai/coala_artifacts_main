Today he came with the following problem.\n\nYou are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string \"abacaba\" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?\n\nEach question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string \"a?b?c\" can be transformed into strings \"aabbc\" and \"azbzc\", but can't be transformed into strings \"aabc\", \"a?bbc\" and \"babbc\".\n\nOccurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string \"ababa\" has two occurrences of a string \"aba\" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string \"aba\" in the string \"acba\" as a substring.\n\nPlease help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string \"abacaba\" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \\leq n \\leq 50$), length of a string $s$.\n\nThe second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case output an answer for it.\n\nIn case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string \"abacaba\" in the resulting string as a substring output \"No\".\n\nOtherwise output \"Yes\" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.\n\nYou may print every letter in \"Yes\" and \"No\" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n7\nabacaba\n7\n???????\n11\naba?abacaba\n11\nabacaba?aba\n15\nasdf???f???qwer\n11\nabacabacaba\n\nOutput\nYes\nabacaba\nYes\nabacaba\nYes\nabadabacaba\nYes\nabacabadaba\nNo\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string \"abacaba\" in the string \"abacaba\" as a substring.\n\nIn second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with \"abacaba\" in particular.\n\nIn sixth example there are two occurrences of a string \"abacaba\" as a substring.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Our task is to determine if it's possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string \"abacaba\" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If it's possible, we should output \"Yes\" and provide one such resulting string. If not, we should output \"No\".\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s` where \"abacaba\" could potentially start (i.e., from index 0 to `n-7`), check if it's possible to form \"abacaba\" by replacing question marks or matching existing characters.\n\n2. **Check for Unique Occurrence**: After forming \"abacaba\" at a potential position, ensure that this is the only occurrence of \"abacaba\" in the entire string.\n\n3. **Replace Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all remaining question marks in the string with any arbitrary letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the transformation.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: If a valid transformation is found, output \"Yes\" and the transformed string.

This is a common issue when the function `solve()` is defined but not called. The function needs to be executed to process the input and produce output.\n\n2. **Logic for Checking \"abacaba\" Placement**: The logic for checking if \"abacaba\" can be placed at a given position seems correct. However, we need to ensure that after placing \"abacaba\", the resulting string is checked for exactly one occurrence of \"abacaba\".\n\n3. **Replacing '?' with 'z'**: The replacement of remaining '?' with 'z' is a valid approach to ensure that no additional \"abacaba\" substrings are accidentally formed. This part seems correct.\n\n4. **Output Format**: The output format should match the expected format, which is a sequence of \"Yes\" or \"No\" followed by the resulting string if \"Yes\".\n\n5. **Function Execution**: The function `solve()` must be called to execute the logic.

        "content": "Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:\n\n1. **Multiple Occurrences Check**: The main issue seems to be with the logic that checks for exactly one occurrence of \"abacaba\". The current solution only checks if \"abacaba\" appears exactly once after placing it at a potential position. However, it doesn't account for the possibility that the original string might already contain \"abacaba\" elsewhere, leading to multiple occurrences.\n\n2. **Handling Existing \"abacaba\"**: If the string already contains \"abacaba\" as a substring, we need to ensure that placing another \"abacaba\" doesn't result in more than one occurrence.\n\n3. **Output Format**: The output format is correct, but the logic needs to ensure that the resulting string truly has only one occurrence of \"abacaba\".\n\n### Steps to Fix the Solution:\n\n1. **Count Existing Occurrences**: Before attempting to place \"abacaba\", count how many times it already appears in the string. If it appears more than once, immediately return \"No\".\n\n2. **Simulate Placement**: For each potential position, simulate placing \"abacaba\" and check if it results in exactly one occurrence in the entire string.\n\n3. **Ensure Uniqueness**: After placing \"abacaba\", ensure that the resulting string has exactly one occurrence by counting again.\n\nLet's implement these changes in the code.\n\n```python\ndef can_place_abacaba(s, i):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    for j in range(7):\n        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef count_abacaba(s):\n    return sum(1 for i in range(len(s) - 6) if s[i:i+7] == \"abacaba\")\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        s = data[index + 1]\n        index += 2\n        \n        # Check existing occurrences of \"abacaba\"\n        existing_count = count_abacaba(s)\n        \n        if existing_count > 1:\n            results.append(\"No\")\n            continue\n        \n        found = False\n        for i in range(n - 6):\n            if can_place_abacaba(s, i):\n                # Try placing \"abacaba\" at position i\n                new_s = list(s)\n                for j in range(7):\n                    if new_s[i + j] == '?':\n                        new_s[i + j] = \"abacaba\"[j]\n                \n                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'\n                new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)\n                \n                # Check if \"abacaba\" appears exactly once\n                if count_abacaba(new_s) == 1:\n                    results.append(\"Yes\")\n                    results.append(new_s)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n        \n        if not found:\n            results.append(\"No\")\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the solution\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **Count Existing Occurrences**: Added a function `count_abacaba` to count occurrences of \"abacaba\" in the string.\n- **Check Before Placement**: Before attempting to place \"abacaba\", check if the existing count is more than one.\n- **Ensure Uniqueness**: After placing \"abacaba\", ensure that the resulting string has exactly one occurrence by using `count_abacaba`."

The key insight is to use a loop to repeatedly search for and remove the \"abc\" substring until it no longer exists in the string.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n\n    1. **Iterative Removal**: Both solutions use a loop to continuously remove \"abc\" from the string. This ensures that all occurrences are removed, even if new ones are formed after an initial removal.\n\n    2. **String Replacement**: The use of the `replace` method is crucial. It allows for the efficient removal of the first occurrence of \"abc\" in my solution, and all occurrences in the official solution. The difference is subtle but both achieve the same end result due to the loop.\n\n    3. **Efficiency Considerations**: The official solution uses `s.count(\"abc\")` to check for the presence of \"abc\", which might be slightly less efficient than checking directly with `\"abc\" in s` as in my solution. However, given the constraints, both approaches are acceptable.\n\n    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions are similar in approach and efficiency. The main takeaway is the effective use of string manipulation methods in Python to iteratively transform a string based on specific patterns.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This involves not only placing \"abacaba\" in potential positions but also ensuring that no other occurrences exist after the placement.\n\n2. **Counting Substring Occurrences**: A critical part of the solution was accurately counting occurrences of the substring \"abacaba\". This was achieved using a helper function that iterates over the string and checks for matches. This approach is efficient given the constraints.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution needed to handle cases where the string already contained \"abacaba\" multiple times, which should immediately result in a \"No\". Additionally, it had to handle strings with question marks that could potentially form multiple \"abacaba\" substrings.\n\n4. **Iterative Placement and Validation**: The solution involved iteratively trying to place \"abacaba\" at each possible position and then validating the entire string to ensure only one occurrence. This approach is straightforward and effective for the given problem size.\n\n5. **Replacing Question Marks**: After attempting to place \"abacaba\", any remaining question marks were replaced with a non-conflicting character ('z') to prevent accidental formation of additional \"abacaba\" substrings.\n\nThe official solution provided a clear and structured approach to solving the problem, emphasizing the importance of checking for existing occurrences and validating the final string configuration.

It first counts existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" in the string; if there is more than one, it outputs \"No\". If there is zero or one occurrence, it attempts to place \"abacaba\" in positions where it can fit by replacing '?' characters, ensuring that the modified string contains exactly one \"abacaba\". If successful, it outputs \"Yes\" followed by the modified string; otherwise, it outputs \"No\". The results for all test cases are then printed.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a specific pattern can be formed in a string by replacing wildcard characters, such as question marks, with specific letters. This is common in problems involving pattern matching, string manipulation, and combinatorial generation of strings. It is particularly relevant in competitive programming and algorithm design, where constraints on the number of occurrences of a pattern are important. The solution involves checking possible placements of the pattern, replacing wildcards, and ensuring the pattern appears exactly once, which is a common technique in string processing tasks."
