## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

We are given a string `s` of length `n` that consists of lowercase English letters and question marks. Our task is to determine if it's possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If it's possible, we should output "Yes" and provide one such resulting string. If not, we should output "No".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s` where "abacaba" could potentially start (i.e., from index 0 to `n-7`), check if it's possible to form "abacaba" by replacing question marks or matching existing characters.

2. **Check for Unique Occurrence**: After forming "abacaba" at a potential position, ensure that this is the only occurrence of "abacaba" in the entire string.

3. **Replace Question Marks**: If a valid position is found, replace all remaining question marks in the string with any arbitrary letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the transformation.

4. **Output the Result**: If a valid transformation is found, output "Yes" and the transformed string. Otherwise, output "No".

### Pseudocode

```
function can_form_abacaba(s, n):
    target = "abacaba"
    target_length = 7

    for start in range(n - target_length + 1):
        # Check if we can form "abacaba" starting at index `start`
        can_form = True
        for i in range(target_length):
            if s[start + i] != '?' and s[start + i] != target[i]:
                can_form = False
                break
        
        if can_form:
            # Create a new string with "abacaba" at the current position
            new_s = list(s)
            for i in range(target_length):
                new_s[start + i] = target[i]
            
            # Check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once
            count = 0
            for i in range(n - target_length + 1):
                if new_s[i:i + target_length] == list(target):
                    count += 1
            
            if count == 1:
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                for i in range(n):
                    if new_s[i] == '?':
                        new_s[i] = 'z'
                return "Yes", "".join(new_s)
    
    return "No", None

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        result, transformed_string = can_form_abacaba(s, n)
        if result == "Yes":

            print(transformed_string)
        else:
            print("No")
```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of removing consecutive "abc" substrings from a given string until none remain. The key insight is to use a loop to repeatedly search for and remove the "abc" substring until it no longer exists in the string.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Iterative Removal**: Both solutions use a loop to continuously remove "abc" from the string. This ensures that all occurrences are removed, even if new ones are formed after an initial removal.

    2. **String Replacement**: The use of the `replace` method is crucial. It allows for the efficient removal of the first occurrence of "abc" in my solution, and all occurrences in the official solution. The difference is subtle but both achieve the same end result due to the loop.

    3. **Efficiency Considerations**: The official solution uses `s.count("abc")` to check for the presence of "abc", which might be slightly less efficient than checking directly with `"abc" in s` as in my solution. However, given the constraints, both approaches are acceptable.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions are similar in approach and efficiency. The main takeaway is the effective use of string manipulation methods in Python to iteratively transform a string based on specific patterns.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----

abacaba

-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` that consists of lowercase English letters and question marks. Our task is to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If it's possible, we should output "Yes" and provide one such resulting string. If not, we should output "No".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s`, check if "abacaba" can be placed starting from that position by replacing question marks and without conflicting with existing letters.

2. **Check for Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba" at a potential position, replace all remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') and check if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the entire string.

3. **Output the Result**: If a valid configuration is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. If no valid configuration is found after checking all positions, output "No".

## Pseudocode

```
function solve():
    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        found = False
        for each position i from 0 to n-7:
            if "abacaba" can be placed at position i:
                create a new string by placing "abacaba" at i and replacing other '?' with 'z'
                if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the new string:
                    print "Yes"
                    print the new string
                    found = True
                    break
        if not found:
            print "No"

function can_place_abacaba(s, i):

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input and Output**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from and writing to standard input/output. This is a common issue when the function `solve()` is defined but not called. The function needs to be executed to process the input and produce output.

2. **Logic for Checking "abacaba" Placement**: The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be placed at a given position seems correct. However, we need to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the resulting string is checked for exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Replacing '?' with 'z'**: The replacement of remaining '?' with 'z' is a valid approach to ensure that no additional "abacaba" substrings are accidentally formed. This part seems correct.

4. **Output Format**: The output format should match the expected format, which is a sequence of "Yes" or "No" followed by the resulting string if "Yes".

5. **Function Execution**: The function `solve()` must be called to execute the logic. This is likely the main issue causing no output to be detected.

Let's fix these issues by ensuring the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
            return False
    return True

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        found = False
        for i in range(n - 6):
            if can_place_abacaba(s, i):
                # Try placing "abacaba" at position i
                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    if new_s[i + j] == '?':
                        new_s[i + j] = "abacaba"[j]
                
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)
                
                # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
                if new_s.count("abacaba") == 1:
                    results.append("Yes")
                    results.append(new_s)
                    found = True
                    break
        
        if not found:
            results.append("No")
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the solution
solve()
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Input/Output Handling**: The input is read from `sys.stdin` and output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s`, check if "abacaba" can be placed starting from that position by replacing question marks and without conflicting with existing letters.

2. **Check for Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba" at a potential position, replace all remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') and check if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the entire string.

3. **Output the Result**: If a valid configuration is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. If no valid configuration is found after checking all positions, output "No".

## Pseudocode

```
function solve():
    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        found = False
        for each position i from 0 to n-7:
            if "abacaba" can be placed at position i:
                create a new string by placing "abacaba" at i and replacing other '?' with 'z'
                if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the new string:
                    print "Yes"
                    print the new string
                    found = True
                    break
        if not found:
            print "No"

function can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    for each character in "abacaba":
        if s[i+j] is not '?' and s[i+j] is not equal to the character:
            return False
    return True
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
            return False
    return True

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        found = False
        for i in range(n - 6):
            if can_place_abacaba(s, i):
                # Try placing "abacaba" at position i
                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    if new_s[i + j] == '?':
                        new_s[i + j] = "abacaba"[j]
                
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)
                
                # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
                if new_s.count("abacaba") == 1:
                    results.append("Yes")
                    results.append(new_s)
                    found = True

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input and Output**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from and writing to standard input/output. This is a common issue when the function `solve()` is defined but not called. The function needs to be executed to process the input and produce output.

2. **Logic for Checking "abacaba" Placement**: The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be placed at a given position seems correct. However, we need to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the resulting string is checked for exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Replacing '?' with 'z'**: The replacement of remaining '?' with 'z' is a valid approach to ensure that no additional "abacaba" substrings are accidentally formed. This part seems correct.

4. **Output Format**: The output format should match the expected format, which is a sequence of "Yes" or "No" followed by the resulting string if "Yes".

5. **Function Execution**: The function `solve()` must be called to execute the logic. This is likely the main issue causing no output to be detected.

Let's fix these issues by ensuring the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
            return False
    return True

def solve():

    input = sys.stdin.read

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])

                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    if new_s[i + j] == '?':
                        new_s[i + j] = "abacaba"[j]
                
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)
                
                # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
                if new_s.count("abacaba") == 1:
                    results.append("Yes")
                    results.append(new_s)
                    found = True

Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of removing consecutive "abc" substrings from a given string until none remain. The key insight is to use a loop to repeatedly search for and remove the "abc" substring until it no longer exists in the string.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Iterative Removal**: Both solutions use a loop to continuously remove "abc" from the string. This ensures that all occurrences are removed, even if new ones are formed after an initial removal.

    2. **String Replacement**: The use of the `replace` method is crucial. It allows for the efficient removal of the first occurrence of "abc" in my solution, and all occurrences in the official solution. The difference is subtle but both achieve the same end result due to the loop.

    3. **Efficiency Considerations**: The official solution uses `s.count("abc")` to check for the presence of "abc", which might be slightly less efficient than checking directly with `"abc" in s` as in my solution. However, given the constraints, both approaches are acceptable.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions are similar in approach and efficiency. The main takeaway is the effective use of string manipulation methods in Python to iteratively transform a string based on specific patterns.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Output

Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No

-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

We are given a string `s` of length `n` that consists of lowercase English letters and question marks. Our task is to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If it's possible, we should output "Yes" and provide one such resulting string. If not, we should output "No".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s`, check if "abacaba" can be placed starting from that position by replacing question marks and without conflicting with existing letters.

2. **Check for Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba" at a potential position, replace all remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') and check if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the entire string.

3. **Output the Result**: If a valid configuration is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. If no valid configuration is found after checking all positions, output "No".

## Pseudocode

```
function solve():
    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        found = False
        for each position i from 0 to n-7:
            if "abacaba" can be placed at position i:
                create a new string by placing "abacaba" at i and replacing other '?' with 'z'
                if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the new string:
                    print "Yes"
                    print the new string
                    found = True
                    break
        if not found:
            print "No"

function can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    for each character in "abacaba":
        if s[i+j] is not '?' and s[i+j] is not equal to the character:
            return False
    return True
```

## Final Python Solution

    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input and Output**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from and writing to standard input/output. This is a common issue when the function `solve()` is defined but not called. The function needs to be executed to process the input and produce output.

2. **Logic for Checking "abacaba" Placement**: The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be placed at a given position seems correct. However, we need to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the resulting string is checked for exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Replacing '?' with 'z'**: The replacement of remaining '?' with 'z' is a valid approach to ensure that no additional "abacaba" substrings are accidentally formed. This part seems correct.

4. **Output Format**: The output format should match the expected format, which is a sequence of "Yes" or "No" followed by the resulting string if "Yes".

5. **Function Execution**: The function `solve()` must be called to execute the logic. This is likely the main issue causing no output to be detected.

Let's fix these issues by ensuring the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:

                        new_s[i + j] = "abacaba"[j]
                
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Multiple Occurrences Check**: The main issue seems to be with the logic that checks for exactly one occurrence of "abacaba". The current solution only checks if "abacaba" appears exactly once after placing it at a potential position. However, it doesn't account for the possibility that the original string might already contain "abacaba" elsewhere, leading to multiple occurrences.

2. **Handling Existing "abacaba"**: If the string already contains "abacaba" as a substring, we need to ensure that placing another "abacaba" doesn't result in more than one occurrence.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is correct, but the logic needs to ensure that the resulting string truly has only one occurrence of "abacaba".

### Steps to Fix the Solution:

1. **Count Existing Occurrences**: Before attempting to place "abacaba", count how many times it already appears in the string. If it appears more than once, immediately return "No".

2. **Simulate Placement**: For each potential position, simulate placing "abacaba" and check if it results in exactly one occurrence in the entire string.

3. **Ensure Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba", ensure that the resulting string has exactly one occurrence by counting again.

Let's implement these changes in the code.

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` that consists of lowercase English letters and question marks. Our task is to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If it's possible, we should output "Yes" and provide one such resulting string. If not, we should output "No".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s`, check if "abacaba" can be placed starting from that position by replacing question marks and without conflicting with existing letters.

2. **Check for Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba" at a potential position, replace all remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') and check if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the entire string.

3. **Output the Result**: If a valid configuration is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. If no valid configuration is found after checking all positions, output "No".

## Pseudocode

```
function solve():
    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        found = False
        for each position i from 0 to n-7:
            if "abacaba" can be placed at position i:
                create a new string by placing "abacaba" at i and replacing other '?' with 'z'
                if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the new string:
                    print "Yes"
                    print the new string
                    found = True
                    break
        if not found:
            print "No"

function can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    for each character in "abacaba":
        if s[i+j] is not '?' and s[i+j] is not equal to the character:
            return False
    return True
```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input and Output**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from and writing to standard input/output. This is a common issue when the function `solve()` is defined but not called. The function needs to be executed to process the input and produce output.

2. **Logic for Checking "abacaba" Placement**: The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be placed at a given position seems correct. However, we need to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the resulting string is checked for exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Replacing '?' with 'z'**: The replacement of remaining '?' with 'z' is a valid approach to ensure that no additional "abacaba" substrings are accidentally formed. This part seems correct.

4. **Output Format**: The output format should match the expected format, which is a sequence of "Yes" or "No" followed by the resulting string if "Yes".

5. **Function Execution**: The function `solve()` must be called to execute the logic. This is likely the main issue causing no output to be detected.

Let's fix these issues by ensuring the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):

                    if new_s[i + j] == '?':
                        new_s[i + j] = "abacaba"[j]

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Multiple Occurrences Check**: The main issue seems to be with the logic that checks for exactly one occurrence of "abacaba". The current solution only checks if "abacaba" appears exactly once after placing it at a potential position. However, it doesn't account for the possibility that the original string might already contain "abacaba" elsewhere, leading to multiple occurrences.

2. **Handling Existing "abacaba"**: If the string already contains "abacaba" as a substring, we need to ensure that placing another "abacaba" doesn't result in more than one occurrence.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is correct, but the logic needs to ensure that the resulting string truly has only one occurrence of "abacaba".

### Steps to Fix the Solution:

1. **Count Existing Occurrences**: Before attempting to place "abacaba", count how many times it already appears in the string. If it appears more than once, immediately return "No".

2. **Simulate Placement**: For each potential position, simulate placing "abacaba" and check if it results in exactly one occurrence in the entire string.

3. **Ensure Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba", ensure that the resulting string has exactly one occurrence by counting again.

Let's implement these changes in the code.

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:

        existing_count = count_abacaba(s)
        
        if existing_count > 1:

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Count Existing Occurrences**: Added a function `count_abacaba` to count occurrences of "abacaba" in the string.

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of removing consecutive "abc" substrings from a given string until none remain. The key insight is to use a loop to repeatedly search for and remove the "abc" substring until it no longer exists in the string.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Iterative Removal**: Both solutions use a loop to continuously remove "abc" from the string. This ensures that all occurrences are removed, even if new ones are formed after an initial removal.

    2. **String Replacement**: The use of the `replace` method is crucial. It allows for the efficient removal of the first occurrence of "abc" in my solution, and all occurrences in the official solution. The difference is subtle but both achieve the same end result due to the loop.

    3. **Efficiency Considerations**: The official solution uses `s.count("abc")` to check for the presence of "abc", which might be slightly less efficient than checking directly with `"abc" in s` as in my solution. However, given the constraints, both approaches are acceptable.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions are similar in approach and efficiency. The main takeaway is the effective use of string manipulation methods in Python to iteratively transform a string based on specific patterns.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Count Existing Occurrences**: Added a function `count_abacaba` to count occurrences of "abacaba" in the string.
- **Check Before Placement**: Before attempting to place "abacaba", check if the existing count is more than one.
- **Ensure Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba", ensure that the resulting string has exactly one occurrence by using `count_abacaba`.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----

7
abacaba
7

abacabacaba

Output
Yes

Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` that consists of lowercase English letters and question marks. Our task is to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If it's possible, we should output "Yes" and provide one such resulting string. If not, we should output "No".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s`, check if "abacaba" can be placed starting from that position by replacing question marks and without conflicting with existing letters.

2. **Check for Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba" at a potential position, replace all remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') and check if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the entire string.

3. **Output the Result**: If a valid configuration is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. If no valid configuration is found after checking all positions, output "No".

## Pseudocode

```
function solve():
    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        found = False
        for each position i from 0 to n-7:
            if "abacaba" can be placed at position i:
                create a new string by placing "abacaba" at i and replacing other '?' with 'z'
                if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the new string:
                    print "Yes"
                    print the new string
                    found = True
                    break
        if not found:
            print "No"

function can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    for each character in "abacaba":
        if s[i+j] is not '?' and s[i+j] is not equal to the character:
            return False
    return True
```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input and Output**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from and writing to standard input/output. This is a common issue when the function `solve()` is defined but not called. The function needs to be executed to process the input and produce output.

2. **Logic for Checking "abacaba" Placement**: The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be placed at a given position seems correct. However, we need to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the resulting string is checked for exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Replacing '?' with 'z'**: The replacement of remaining '?' with 'z' is a valid approach to ensure that no additional "abacaba" substrings are accidentally formed. This part seems correct.

4. **Output Format**: The output format should match the expected format, which is a sequence of "Yes" or "No" followed by the resulting string if "Yes".

5. **Function Execution**: The function `solve()` must be called to execute the logic. This is likely the main issue causing no output to be detected.

Let's fix these issues by ensuring the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:

                        new_s[i + j] = "abacaba"[j]
                
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Multiple Occurrences Check**: The main issue seems to be with the logic that checks for exactly one occurrence of "abacaba". The current solution only checks if "abacaba" appears exactly once after placing it at a potential position. However, it doesn't account for the possibility that the original string might already contain "abacaba" elsewhere, leading to multiple occurrences.

2. **Handling Existing "abacaba"**: If the string already contains "abacaba" as a substring, we need to ensure that placing another "abacaba" doesn't result in more than one occurrence.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is correct, but the logic needs to ensure that the resulting string truly has only one occurrence of "abacaba".

### Steps to Fix the Solution:

1. **Count Existing Occurrences**: Before attempting to place "abacaba", count how many times it already appears in the string. If it appears more than once, immediately return "No".

2. **Simulate Placement**: For each potential position, simulate placing "abacaba" and check if it results in exactly one occurrence in the entire string.

3. **Ensure Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba", ensure that the resulting string has exactly one occurrence by counting again.

Let's implement these changes in the code.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] In tackling the problem of determining if the string "abacaba" can be placed exactly once in a given string with question marks, the core concept was to ensure that the substring appears exactly once after replacing the question marks. The problem tested the ability to manipulate strings and count specific substrings efficiently.

### Key Strategies:
1. **Initial Check for Existing Occurrences**: Before attempting to place "abacaba", count how many times it already appears in the string. If it appears more than once, output "No" immediately.

2. **Simulating Placement**: For each potential starting position, simulate placing "abacaba" by replacing question marks and ensuring no conflicts with existing characters.

3. **Ensuring Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba", replace remaining question marks with a non-conflicting character (e.g., 'z') and check if "abacaba" appears exactly once.

### Challenges and Fixes:
- **Function Execution**: Initially, the function was defined but not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is executed was crucial.
- **Counting Occurrences**: A helper function `count_abacaba` was used to count occurrences of "abacaba" in the string, which was essential for verifying the uniqueness of the placement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `s` of length `n` that consists of lowercase English letters and question marks. Our task is to determine if it's possible to replace the question marks with lowercase English letters such that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once as a substring in the resulting string. If it's possible, we should output "Yes" and provide one such resulting string. If not, we should output "No".

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Potential Positions**: For each position in the string `s`, check if "abacaba" can be placed starting from that position by replacing question marks and without conflicting with existing letters.

2. **Check for Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba" at a potential position, replace all remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') and check if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the entire string.

3. **Output the Result**: If a valid configuration is found, output "Yes" and the resulting string. If no valid configuration is found after checking all positions, output "No".

## Pseudocode

```
function solve():
    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read n
        read s
        found = False
        for each position i from 0 to n-7:
            if "abacaba" can be placed at position i:
                create a new string by placing "abacaba" at i and replacing other '?' with 'z'
                if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the new string:
                    print "Yes"
                    print the new string
                    found = True
                    break
        if not found:
            print "No"

function can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    for each character in "abacaba":
        if s[i+j] is not '?' and s[i+j] is not equal to the character:
            return False
    return True

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input and Output**: The feedback suggests that there might be an issue with reading from and writing to standard input/output. This is a common issue when the function `solve()` is defined but not called. The function needs to be executed to process the input and produce output.

2. **Logic for Checking "abacaba" Placement**: The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be placed at a given position seems correct. However, we need to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the resulting string is checked for exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Replacing '?' with 'z'**: The replacement of remaining '?' with 'z' is a valid approach to ensure that no additional "abacaba" substrings are accidentally formed. This part seems correct.

4. **Output Format**: The output format should match the expected format, which is a sequence of "Yes" or "No" followed by the resulting string if "Yes".

5. **Function Execution**: The function `solve()` must be called to execute the logic. This is likely the main issue causing no output to be detected.

Let's fix these issues by ensuring the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Multiple Occurrences Check**: The main issue seems to be with the logic that checks for exactly one occurrence of "abacaba". The current solution only checks if "abacaba" appears exactly once after placing it at a potential position. However, it doesn't account for the possibility that the original string might already contain "abacaba" elsewhere, leading to multiple occurrences.

2. **Handling Existing "abacaba"**: If the string already contains "abacaba" as a substring, we need to ensure that placing another "abacaba" doesn't result in more than one occurrence.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is correct, but the logic needs to ensure that the resulting string truly has only one occurrence of "abacaba".

### Steps to Fix the Solution:

1. **Count Existing Occurrences**: Before attempting to place "abacaba", count how many times it already appears in the string. If it appears more than once, immediately return "No".

2. **Simulate Placement**: For each potential position, simulate placing "abacaba" and check if it results in exactly one occurrence in the entire string.

3. **Ensure Uniqueness**: After placing "abacaba", ensure that the resulting string has exactly one occurrence by counting again.

Let's implement these changes in the code.

```python
def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
    target = "abacaba"
    for j in range(7):
        if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, there are several key insights and lessons learned:

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**: The problem required ensuring that the string "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string. This involves not only placing "abacaba" in potential positions but also ensuring that no other occurrences exist after the placement.

2. **Counting Substring Occurrences**: A critical part of the solution was accurately counting occurrences of the substring "abacaba". This was achieved using a helper function that iterates over the string and checks for matches. This approach is efficient given the constraints.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution needed to handle cases where the string already contained "abacaba" multiple times, which should immediately result in a "No". Additionally, it had to handle strings with question marks that could potentially form multiple "abacaba" substrings.

4. **Iterative Placement and Validation**: The solution involved iteratively trying to place "abacaba" at each possible position and then validating the entire string to ensure only one occurrence. This approach is straightforward and effective for the given problem size.

5. **Replacing Question Marks**: After attempting to place "abacaba", any remaining question marks were replaced with a non-conflicting character ('z') to prevent accidental formation of additional "abacaba" substrings.

The official solution provided a clear and structured approach to solving the problem, emphasizing the importance of checking for existing occurrences and validating the final string configuration. This problem reinforced the value of breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and systematically addressing each requirement.

[Problem]
    Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

    You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

    Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

    Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

    Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


    -----Input-----

    First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

    The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

    The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case output an answer for it.

    In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

    Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

    You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

    -----Note-----

    In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

    In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

    In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.
