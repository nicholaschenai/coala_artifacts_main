    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nAnushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a given amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price, and she cannot buy the same chocolate more than once. Given a list of chocolate prices and the total amount of money Anushka has, determine the maximum number of chocolates she can purchase.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Sort the Prices**: Start by sorting the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This allows Anushka to buy the cheapest chocolates first, maximizing the number she can purchase.\n\n2. **Buy Chocolates**: Iterate through the sorted list of prices, and keep buying chocolates until the total cost exceeds the amount of money Anushka has.\n\n3. **Count the Chocolates**: Keep a count of how many chocolates Anushka can buy before running out of money.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Sort the list of prices in ascending order.\n2. Initialize a counter for the number of chocolates bought to 0.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total money spent to 0.\n4. For each price in the sorted list:\n   - If adding the current price to the total spent does not exceed the available money:\n     - Add the price to the total spent.\n     - Increment the chocolate counter.\n   - Otherwise, break the loop as no more chocolates can be bought.\n5. Return the chocolate counter as the result.\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n    # Step 1: Sort the prices in ascending order\n    prices.sort()\n    \n    # Step 2: Initialize variables\n    chocolate_count = 0\n    total_spent = 0\n    \n    # Step 3: Iterate over sorted prices\n    for price in prices:\n        # Check if the current price can be added without exceeding the budget\n        if total_spent + price <= k:\n            total_spent += price\n            chocolate_count += 1\n        else:\n            # If the budget is exceeded, stop buying\n            break\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the number of chocolates bought\n    return chocolate_count\n```\n\nThis code will read the number of chocolates and the budget, sort the prices, and then determine the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy without exceeding her budget.",
