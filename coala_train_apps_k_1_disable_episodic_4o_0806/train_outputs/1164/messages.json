Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).\nThe difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:\n- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.\n- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.\n- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.\n- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.\nYou should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.\n- $2P$ lines follow.

We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on the number of subtasks where the number of contestants solving it decreases as the score increases. The difficulty of a problem is represented as a pair of integers, where the first integer is the count of such subtasks and the second is the problem's index. We need to sort the problems by difficulty, first by the count of decreasing subtasks and then by the problem index if counts are equal.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1.

For each problem, it pairs scores with contestants, sorts these pairs by score, and counts how many times the contestant number decreases in the sorted list. It then calculates a difficulty measure for each problem based on this count and the problem's index. The problems are sorted by their difficulty measure in ascending order, with ties broken by the problem index in descending order. Finally, it prints the indices of the problems in the order of their calculated difficulty.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to rank or sort items based on a custom difficulty metric that involves multiple attributes. Specifically, it applies to situations where you have a set of tasks or problems, each with multiple components or subtasks, and you need to determine the difficulty based on the performance or results of these components. This can be applied in competitive programming contests, educational assessments, or any situation where tasks are broken down into subtasks with varying levels of completion or success. The method of sorting by a primary metric (number of decreases) and a secondary metric (original index) is a common pattern in ranking problems."
