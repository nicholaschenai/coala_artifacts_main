## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on the number of subtasks where the number of contestants solving it decreases as the score increases. The difficulty of a problem is represented as a pair of integers, where the first integer is the count of such subtasks and the second is the problem's index. We need to sort the problems by difficulty, first by the count of decreasing subtasks and then by the problem index if counts are equal.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each problem, pair the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
2. Sort these pairs by score to ensure the subtasks are in increasing order of score.
3. Count the number of times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.
4. Store the difficulty as a tuple of this count and the problem index.
5. Sort all problems by their difficulty tuples.
6. Output the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    for i from 0 to P-1:
        scores = problems[2*i]
        contestants = problems[2*i + 1]
        subtask_pairs = zip(scores, contestants)
        sorted_subtasks = sort(subtask_pairs by score)
        count_decreasing = 0
        for j from 0 to S-2:
            if sorted_subtasks[j][1] > sorted_subtasks[j+1][1]:
                count_decreasing += 1
        difficulties.append((count_decreasing, i+1))
    sort difficulties by (count_decreasing, index)
    return indices from sorted difficulties

read P, S
read problems as list of lists
result = calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems)
for each index in result:
    print index
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    
    for i in range(P):
        scores = problems[2 * i]
        contestants = problems[2 * i + 1]
        
        # Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
        subtask_pairs = list(zip(scores, contestants))
        subtask_pairs.sort()  # Sort by score automatically
        
        # Count the number of decreasing contestant numbers
        count_decreasing = 0
        for j in range(S - 1):
            if subtask_pairs[j][1] > subtask_pairs[j + 1][1]:
                count_decreasing += 1
        
        # Store the difficulty as a tuple (count_decreasing, problem_index)
        difficulties.append((count_decreasing, i + 1))
    
    # Sort difficulties by (count_decreasing, problem_index)
    difficulties.sort()
    
    # Extract and return the sorted problem indices
    return [index for _, index in difficulties]

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

P = int(data[0])
S = int(data[1])

problems = []
index = 2
for _ in range(2 * P):
    problems.append(list(map(int, data[index:index + S])))
    index += S

# Calculate and print the result
result = calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems)
for index in result:
    print(index)
```

This solution reads input, processes each problem to determine its difficulty, sorts the problems by difficulty, and outputs the indices in the required order.

You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that Chef can host given a set of constraints. The solution required calculating the total number of problems available, determining how many contests could be formed, and then limiting this by the number of days available.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Input Handling:** The official solution uses a straightforward approach to read input directly from standard input using `input()`. This is typical in competitive programming and ensures that the solution is efficient and concise.

    2. **Calculation of Contests:** The solution calculates the total number of problems and then determines the maximum number of contests by dividing the total problems by `K`. This is a direct and efficient way to determine how many full contests can be formed.

    3. **Limiting by Days:** The use of `min(P, D)` ensures that the number of contests does not exceed the number of days available, which is a crucial constraint in the problem.

    ### Reflection:

    The official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions to handle input and perform calculations. My initial approach was similar in logic but required adjustments in input handling to align with competitive programming standards. The key takeaway is the importance of efficient input/output handling and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement. This experience reinforces the need to carefully manage input and output in a competitive programming context and to ensure that the logic correctly implements all constraints.

We have a contest with multiple problems, each containing several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is determined by counting how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We need to sort the problems by their difficulty, where a problem is considered more difficult if it has more such decreases, or if the number of decreases is the same, the problem with the higher index is considered more difficult. Finally, we output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of problems `P` and the number of subtasks `S`. For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.

2. **Calculate Difficulty**: For each problem, sort the subtasks by score. Count how many times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.

3. **Sort Problems**: Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty count and the problem index. Sort this list first by the difficulty count in ascending order, and then by the problem index in descending order if the difficulty counts are the same.

4. **Output**: Print the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

 ## Problem Restatement

We have a contest with multiple problems, each containing several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is determined by counting how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We need to sort the problems by their difficulty, where a problem is considered more difficult if it has more such decreases, or if the number of decreases is the same, the problem with the higher index is considered more difficult. Finally, we output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of problems `P` and the number of subtasks `S`. For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.

2. **Calculate Difficulty**: For each problem, sort the subtasks by score. Count how many times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.

3. **Sort Problems**: Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty count and the problem index. Sort this list first by the difficulty count in ascending order, and then by the problem index in descending order if the difficulty counts are the same.

4. **Output**: Print the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
3 3
16 24 60

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a contest with multiple problems, each containing several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is determined by counting how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We need to sort the problems by their difficulty, where a problem is considered more difficult if it has more such decreases, or if the number of decreases is the same, the problem with the higher index is considered more difficult. Finally, we output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of problems `P` and the number of subtasks `S`. For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.

2. **Calculate Difficulty**: For each problem, sort the subtasks by score. Count how many times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.

3. **Sort Problems**: Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty count and the problem index. Sort this list first by the difficulty count in ascending order, and then by the problem index in descending order if the difficulty counts are the same.

4. **Output**: Print the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    for i from 0 to P-1:
        scores = problems[i][0]
        contestants = problems[i][1]
        
        // Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
        paired = zip(scores, contestants)
        sorted_paired = sort(paired by score)
        
        // Count decreases in number of contestants
        decrease_count = 0
        for j from 0 to S-2:
            if sorted_paired[j][1] > sorted_paired[j+1][1]:
                decrease_count += 1
        
        // Store the difficulty and index
        difficulties.append((decrease_count, i+1))
    
    // Sort difficulties by decrease_count ascending, then index descending
    sorted_difficulties = sort(difficulties by (decrease_count, -index))
    
    // Output the sorted indices
    for difficulty in sorted_difficulties:
        print(difficulty[1])

// Read input and call the function
```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution:

1. **Function Call**: The function `calculate_difficulty()` is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when the function is defined to encapsulate logic but is not executed.

2. **Input Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments. However, if the function is not called, this input reading will not be executed.

3. **Output**: The function is designed to print the results directly, which is correct. However, since the function is not called, no output is generated.

### Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `calculate_difficulty()` function is called after its definition to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input/Output**: Ensure that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

Let's correct the code by calling the function:

        index += 2 * S
    
    difficulties = []
    
    for i in range(P):
        scores, contestants = problems[i]
        
        # Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
        paired = list(zip(scores, contestants))
        paired.sort()
        
        # Count decreases in number of contestants
        decrease_count = 0
        for j in range(S - 1):
            if paired[j][1] > paired[j + 1][1]:
                decrease_count += 1
        
        # Store the difficulty and index
        difficulties.append((decrease_count, i + 1))
    
    # Sort difficulties by decrease_count ascending, then index descending
    difficulties.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    
    # Output the sorted indices
    for difficulty in difficulties:
        print(difficulty[1])

# Call the function to execute the logic

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that Chef can host given a set of constraints. The core concept involved calculating the total number of problems available and determining how many full contests could be formed, while also considering the limitation of the number of days available.

    Initially, the solution failed because it did not handle input and output correctly for a competitive programming environment. The function was defined but not called, and input was not read from standard input. The key takeaway was the importance of correctly managing input and output, especially in environments where the input is provided all at once and needs to be processed in a structured manner.

    The successful strategy involved reading all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, splitting it into manageable parts, and using an index to track the current position in the input data. This approach ensured that all test cases were processed correctly, and results were printed in the required format. This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the input/output requirements and constraints in competitive programming problems.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
3 3
16 24 60
498 861 589

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a contest with multiple problems, each containing several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is determined by counting how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We need to sort the problems by their difficulty, where a problem is considered more difficult if it has more such decreases, or if the number of decreases is the same, the problem with the higher index is considered more difficult. Finally, we output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of problems `P` and the number of subtasks `S`. For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.

2. **Calculate Difficulty**: For each problem, sort the subtasks by score. Count how many times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.

3. **Sort Problems**: Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty count and the problem index. Sort this list first by the difficulty count in ascending order, and then by the problem index in descending order if the difficulty counts are the same.

4. **Output**: Print the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    for i from 0 to P-1:
        scores = problems[i][0]
        contestants = problems[i][1]
        
        // Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
        paired = zip(scores, contestants)
        sorted_paired = sort(paired by score)
        
        // Count decreases in number of contestants
        decrease_count = 0
        for j from 0 to S-2:
            if sorted_paired[j][1] > sorted_paired[j+1][1]:
                decrease_count += 1
        
        // Store the difficulty and index
        difficulties.append((decrease_count, i+1))
    
    // Sort difficulties by decrease_count ascending, then index descending

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution:

1. **Function Call**: The function `calculate_difficulty()` is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when the function is defined to encapsulate logic but is not executed.

2. **Input Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments. However, if the function is not called, this input reading will not be executed.

3. **Output**: The function is designed to print the results directly, which is correct. However, since the function is not called, no output is generated.

### Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `calculate_difficulty()` function is called after its definition to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input/Output**: Ensure that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

Let's correct the code by calling the function:

```python
def calculate_difficulty():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    P = int(data[0])
    S = int(data[1])

        scores = list(map(int, data[index:index+S]))
        contestants = list(map(int, data[index+S:index+2*S]))
        problems.append((scores, contestants))
        index += 2 * S
    
    difficulties = []
    
    for i in range(P):
        scores, contestants = problems[i]
        
        # Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
        paired = list(zip(scores, contestants))
        paired.sort()
        
        # Count decreases in number of contestants
        decrease_count = 0
        for j in range(S - 1):
            if paired[j][1] > paired[j + 1][1]:
                decrease_count += 1
        
        # Store the difficulty and index
        difficulties.append((decrease_count, i + 1))
    
    # Sort difficulties by decrease_count ascending, then index descending

- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the difficulty of contest problems based on the number of subtasks where the number of contestants solving them decreases as the score increases. The core concept involved sorting subtasks by score and counting these decreases to determine a difficulty metric for each problem.

Initially, the solution encapsulated the logic within a function but failed to call it, resulting in no output. This highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed, especially when handling input and output in competitive programming environments.

The successful strategy involved:
1. Parsing input correctly using `sys.stdin.read()` to handle large input sizes efficiently.
2. Sorting subtasks by score and counting decreases in the number of contestants.
3. Sorting problems by difficulty and outputting the indices in the required order.

The key takeaway is to always ensure that the main function is called, especially when dealing with input/output in a competitive programming context. Additionally, understanding how to manipulate and sort data based on custom criteria is crucial for solving similar problems.

Finally, we output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of problems `P` and the number of subtasks `S`. For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.

2. **Calculate Difficulty**: For each problem, sort the subtasks by score. Count how many times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.

3. **Sort Problems**: Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty count and the problem index. Sort this list first by the difficulty count in ascending order, and then by the problem index in descending order if the difficulty counts are the same.

4. **Output**: Print the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    for i from 0 to P-1:
        scores = problems[i][0]
        contestants = problems[i][1]
        
        // Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
        paired = zip(scores, contestants)
        sorted_paired = sort(paired by score)
        
        // Count decreases in number of contestants
        decrease_count = 0
        for j from 0 to S-2:
            if sorted_paired[j][1] > sorted_paired[j+1][1]:
                decrease_count += 1
        
        // Store the difficulty and index
        difficulties.append((decrease_count, i+1))
    
    // Sort difficulties by decrease_count ascending, then index descending
    sorted_difficulties = sort(difficulties by (decrease_count, -index))
    
    // Output the sorted indices
    for difficulty in sorted_difficulties:
        print(difficulty[1])

// Read input and call the function
```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution:

1. **Function Call**: The function `calculate_difficulty()` is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when the function is defined to encapsulate logic but is not executed.

2. **Input Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments. However, if the function is not called, this input reading will not be executed.

3. **Output**: The function is designed to print the results directly, which is correct. However, since the function is not called, no output is generated.

### Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Call the Function**: Ensure that the `calculate_difficulty()` function is called after its definition to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input/Output**: Ensure that the input is read correctly and the output is printed as expected.

Let's correct the code by calling the function:

```python
def calculate_difficulty():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    P = int(data[0])
    S = int(data[1])
    
    index = 2
    problems = []
    
    for _ in range(P):
        scores = list(map(int, data[index:index+S]))
        contestants = list(map(int, data[index+S:index+2*S]))
        problems.append((scores, contestants))
        index += 2 * S
    
    difficulties = []
    
    for i in range(P):
        scores, contestants = problems[i]
        
        # Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
        paired = list(zip(scores, contestants))
        paired.sort()
        
        # Count decreases in number of contestants
        decrease_count = 0
        for j in range(S - 1):
            if paired[j][1] > paired[j + 1][1]:
                decrease_count += 1
        
        # Store the difficulty and index
        difficulties.append((decrease_count, i + 1))
    
    # Sort difficulties by decrease_count ascending, then index descending
    difficulties.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    
    # Output the sorted indices
    for difficulty in difficulties:
        print(difficulty[1])

# Call the function to execute the logic

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem involved sorting problems based on a calculated difficulty metric, which required careful handling of input and sorting logic. Here are some insights and learnings from the exercise:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem required reading a large amount of input data efficiently. Using `sys.stdin.read()` was appropriate for competitive programming environments, but it was crucial to ensure the function was called to execute the logic.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The difficulty was determined by counting decreases in the number of contestants solving subtasks as scores increased. This required sorting subtasks by score and then iterating to count decreases. The official solution used a dictionary to map scores to contestant numbers, which was a clean way to handle the data.

3. **Sorting Problems**: The official solution used a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score, which allowed for efficient sorting and output. This approach was insightful as it separated the concerns of calculating difficulty and sorting problems, making the code more modular and easier to understand.

4. **Output**: The official solution sorted the problems by difficulty and then by index, which was a key requirement. It used a combination of sorting keys and list operations to achieve the desired order.

Overall, the official solution was efficient and well-structured, providing a clear approach to handling the problem's requirements. The use of dictionaries for grouping and sorting was particularly insightful and could be useful in similar problems where categorization and sorting are needed.

[Problem]
    Mandarin chinese
    , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
    Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
    The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
    - Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
    - Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
    - Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
    - For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
    You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
    - $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

    -----Output-----
    Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le P \le 100,000$
    - $2 \le S \le 30$
    - $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
    - $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
    - in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
    Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints
