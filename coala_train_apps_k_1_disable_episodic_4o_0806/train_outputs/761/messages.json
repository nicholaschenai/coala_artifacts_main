He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.\nThe good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! \nThe Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.\nPressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.\nPressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.\nChef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?\nBe careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

Chef can use a time machine with two types of buttons: white buttons that reduce the number of planned tasks and black buttons that increase the number of completed tasks. Each button can only be used once, and there are constraints on when they can be used. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks for the day are greater than or equal to the button's value.\n   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks for that day.\n\n2. **Objective**: Minimize the total uncompleted tasks, which is the sum of (planned tasks - completed tasks) for all days.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction in planned tasks.\n   - Sort the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.\n   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce planned tasks.\n   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase completed tasks.\n   - Keep track of the total uncompleted tasks after applying the buttons.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N, K, M\n        read planned_tasks (A)\n        read completed_tasks (B)\n        read white_buttons (C)\n        read black_buttons (D)\n        \n        sort C in descending order\n        sort D in descending order\n        \n        for each day i from 0 to N-1:\n            for each white_button in C:\n                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:\n                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button\n                    remove white_button from C\n                    break\n            \n            for each black_button in D:\n                if completed_tasks[i] + black_button <= planned_tasks[i]:\n                    completed_tasks[i] += black_button\n                    remove black_button from D\n                    break\n        \n        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i] for i in range(N))\n        print total_uncompleted_tasks\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, M = test_case['N'], test_case['K'], test_case['M']\n        planned_tasks = test_case['planned_tasks']\n        completed_tasks = test_case['completed_tasks']\n        white_buttons = sorted(test_case['white_buttons'], reverse=True)\n        black_buttons = sorted(test_case['black_buttons'], reverse=True)\n        \n        # Apply white buttons\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(len(white_buttons)):\n                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_buttons[j]:\n                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_buttons[j]\n                    white_buttons.pop(j)\n                    break\n        \n        # Apply black buttons\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(len(black_buttons)):\n                if completed_tasks[i] + black_buttons[j] <= planned_tasks[i]:\n                    completed_tasks[i] += black_buttons[j]\n                    black_buttons.pop(j)\n                    break\n        \n        # Calculate total uncompleted tasks\n        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i] for i in range(N))\n        results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 1\n# test_cases = [\n#     {\n#         'N': 4,\n#         'K': 2,\n#         'M': 2,\n#         'planned_tasks': [5, 7, 6, 1],\n#         'completed_tasks': [3, 3, 1, 1],\n#         'white_buttons': [6, 3],\n#         'black_buttons': [1, 4]\n#     }\n# ]\n# minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes each test case by applying the buttons optimally, and outputs the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks."

This is typical in competitive programming and ensures that the solution is efficient and concise.\n\n    2. **Calculation of Contests:** The solution calculates the total number of problems and then determines the maximum number of contests by dividing the total problems by `K`. This is a direct and efficient way to determine how many full contests can be formed.\n\n    3. **Limiting by Days:** The use of `min(P, D)` ensures that the number of contests does not exceed the number of days available, which is a crucial constraint in the problem.\n\n    ### Reflection:\n\n    The official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions to handle input and perform calculations. My initial approach was similar in logic but required adjustments in input handling to align with competitive programming standards. The key takeaway is the importance of efficient input/output handling and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement. This experience reinforces the need to carefully manage input and output in a competitive programming context and to ensure that the logic correctly implements all constraints.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The correct approach was to use the largest possible button effect that fits the constraints for each day.\n\n2. **Constraints Handling**: A critical error was allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, leading to negative uncompleted tasks. This was fixed by ensuring that any increase in completed tasks with a black button did not surpass the planned tasks.\n\n3. **Iterative Approach**: The solution required iterating over each day and applying the best possible button effect. Sorting the buttons in descending order helped in prioritizing the largest impact first.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n\n```python\ndef minimize_uncompleted_tasks():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, M = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n        index += 3\n        A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n        index += N\n        B = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n        index += N\n        C = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+K]), reverse=True)\n        index += K\n        D = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+M]), reverse=True)\n        index += M\n        \n        # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n        for i in range(N):\n            for c in C:\n                if A[i] >= c:\n                    A[i] -= c\n                    break  # Use only one white button per day\n        \n        # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n        for i in range(N):\n            for d in D:\n                if B[i] + d <= A[i]:\n                    B[i] += d\n                    break  # Use only one black button per day\n        \n        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))\n        results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nminimize_uncompleted_tasks()\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and optimizing within them. It also highlighted the need for careful handling of input/output and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem's requirements. Future attempts should focus on verifying constraints and iterating through possible solutions efficiently."

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - The problem involves minimizing the uncompleted tasks by using a set of buttons that can either reduce planned tasks or increase completed tasks.\n   - The goal is to use these buttons optimally across multiple days to achieve the minimum possible uncompleted tasks.\n\n2. **Approach of the Official Solution**:\n   - **Difference Calculation**: The official solution calculates the initial difference between planned and completed tasks for each day, storing these differences in a list `liab`.\n   - **Button Pooling**: It combines both white and black buttons into a single list `likm` and sorts them. This allows for a unified approach to reducing the difference.\n   - **Optimization Strategy**: The solution iterates over the sorted differences and attempts to reduce each difference using the largest available button that fits the constraint. This is done by popping the smallest button from the sorted list `likm` and applying it if it reduces the difference to a non-negative value.\n\n3. **Why My Approach Failed**:\n   - **Single Button Usage**: My approach incorrectly assumed that only one button could be used per day, which limited the potential for optimization.\n   - **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for applying buttons was flawed, leading to negative uncompleted tasks, which is not possible under the problem constraints.\n   - **Lack of Unified Button Strategy**: I did not consider combining the buttons into a single pool, which simplifies the logic and allows for more flexible application of button effects.\n\n4. **Lessons Learned**:\n   - **Unified Button Strategy**: Combining all buttons into a single list and sorting them can simplify the problem and lead to a more effective solution.\n   - **Iterative Optimization**: Iterating over the differences and applying the largest possible reduction is a powerful strategy for minimizing uncompleted tasks.\n   - **Constraints Handling**: Ensuring that operations do not lead to invalid states (e.g., negative tasks) is crucial for correctness.\n\nThis reflection highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and exploring different strategies for optimization. The official solution's approach of pooling and sorting buttons provides a clear and effective method for tackling similar problems in the future."
