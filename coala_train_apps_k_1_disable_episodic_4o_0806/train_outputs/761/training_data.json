    "summary": "In tackling the problem of minimizing uncompleted tasks using a time machine with buttons, I encountered several challenges related to button usage logic and constraints handling. The core concept was to optimize the use of white and black buttons to adjust planned and completed tasks, respectively, while adhering to constraints.\n\n### Key Learnings:\n\n1. **Button Usage Logic**: Initially, I attempted to use multiple buttons per day, which was incorrect as the problem constraints allowed only one button per day. The correct approach was to use the largest possible button effect that fits the constraints for each day.\n\n2. **Constraints Handling**: A critical error was allowing completed tasks to exceed planned tasks, leading to negative uncompleted tasks. This was fixed by ensuring that any increase in completed tasks with a black button did not surpass the planned tasks.\n\n3. **Iterative Approach**: The solution required iterating over each day and applying the best possible button effect. Sorting the buttons in descending order helped in prioritizing the largest impact first.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n\n```python\ndef minimize_uncompleted_tasks():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, M = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n        index += 3\n        A = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n        index += N\n        B = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n        index += N\n        C = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+K]), reverse=True)\n        index += K\n        D = sorted(map(int, data[index:index+M]), reverse=True)\n        index += M\n        \n        # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n        for i in range(N):\n            for c in C:\n                if A[i] >= c:\n                    A[i] -= c\n                    break  # Use only one white button per day\n        \n        # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n        for i in range(N):\n            for d in D:\n                if B[i] + d <= A[i]:\n                    B[i] += d\n                    break  # Use only one black button per day\n        \n        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))\n        results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nminimize_uncompleted_tasks()\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and optimizing within them. It also highlighted the need for careful handling of input/output and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem's requirements. Future attempts should focus on verifying constraints and iterating through possible solutions efficiently.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - The problem involves minimizing the uncompleted tasks by using a set of buttons that can either reduce planned tasks or increase completed tasks.\n   - The goal is to use these buttons optimally across multiple days to achieve the minimum possible uncompleted tasks.\n\n2. **Approach of the Official Solution**:\n   - **Difference Calculation**: The official solution calculates the initial difference between planned and completed tasks for each day, storing these differences in a list `liab`.\n   - **Button Pooling**: It combines both white and black buttons into a single list `likm` and sorts them. This allows for a unified approach to reducing the difference.\n   - **Optimization Strategy**: The solution iterates over the sorted differences and attempts to reduce each difference using the largest available button that fits the constraint. This is done by popping the smallest button from the sorted list `likm` and applying it if it reduces the difference to a non-negative value.\n\n3. **Why My Approach Failed**:\n   - **Single Button Usage**: My approach incorrectly assumed that only one button could be used per day, which limited the potential for optimization.\n   - **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for applying buttons was flawed, leading to negative uncompleted tasks, which is not possible under the problem constraints.\n   - **Lack of Unified Button Strategy**: I did not consider combining the buttons into a single pool, which simplifies the logic and allows for more flexible application of button effects.\n\n4. **Lessons Learned**:\n   - **Unified Button Strategy**: Combining all buttons into a single list and sorting them can simplify the problem and lead to a more effective solution.\n   - **Iterative Optimization**: Iterating over the differences and applying the largest possible reduction is a powerful strategy for minimizing uncompleted tasks.\n   - **Constraints Handling**: Ensuring that operations do not lead to invalid states (e.g., negative tasks) is crucial for correctness.\n\nThis reflection highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and exploring different strategies for optimization. The official solution's approach of pooling and sorting buttons provides a clear and effective method for tackling similar problems in the future.",
