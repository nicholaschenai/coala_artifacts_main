INFO - [Task id] 1211 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a string consisting of lowercase English letters. The task is to repeatedly remove any occurrence of the substring "abc" from the string until no such substring remains. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Iterate through each test case**: For each test case, we will process the given string.
2. **Remove "abc" substrings**: Continuously search for the substring "abc" in the string. If found, remove it and check the string again.
3. **Repeat until no "abc" is found**: Continue the removal process until the string no longer contains the substring "abc".
4. **Output the final string**: Once no more "abc" substrings are present, output the resulting string for that test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function remove_abc_pairs(string):
    while "abc" is in string:
        remove the first occurrence of "abc" from string
    return string

function process_test_cases(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        result = remove_abc_pairs(test_case)
        print result

read number of test cases T
initialize an empty list test_cases
for i from 1 to T:
    read a string and append it to test_cases
process_test_cases(test_cases)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def remove_abc_pairs(s):
    # Continuously remove "abc" from the string
    while "abc" in s:
        s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)  # Remove the first occurrence of "abc"
    return s

def process_test_cases(test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        result = remove_abc_pairs(test_case)
        print(result)

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
test_cases = []

# Read each test case
for _ in range(T):
    test_case = input().strip()
    test_cases.append(test_case)

# Process each test case
process_test_cases(test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **remove_abc_pairs**: This function takes a string and repeatedly removes the first occurrence of "abc" until no such substring is found. It uses the `replace` method with a count of 1 to ensure only the first occurrence is removed in each iteration.
  
- **process_test_cases**: This function iterates over each test case, applies the `remove_abc_pairs` function, and prints the result.

- **Main Execution**: The program reads the number of test cases, collects each test case string, and then processes them using the defined functions.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

    1. **Problem Understanding and Approach:**
       - The problem requires finding the shortest superstring that contains all given strings as substrings. The challenge is to efficiently merge strings by maximizing overlaps.
       - My initial approach used dynamic programming to track overlaps and reconstruct the superstring, which is a valid strategy but can be complex to implement correctly.

    2. **Official Solution Insights:**
       - The official solution uses a memoization technique to optimize the recursive calculation of the shortest superstring. This is a powerful approach to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
       - The `merge` function is used to concatenate two strings with the maximum possible overlap, which is a crucial step in minimizing the length of the superstring.
       - The `find_short` function recursively finds the shortest superstring for a given subset of strings, using memoization to store and reuse results.

    3. **Key Differences and Improvements:**
       - The official solution simplifies the problem by using a recursive approach with memoization, which can be more intuitive and easier to manage than a full dynamic programming table.
       - The use of a decorator for memoization (`@memo`) is a neat way to cache results of recursive calls, reducing the need for manual management of a DP table.
       - The solution also includes a preprocessing step to remove any string that is a substring of another, which simplifies the problem space.

    4. **Learning Points:**
       - Memoization can be a powerful tool in recursive solutions, especially when dealing with overlapping subproblems.
       - Simplifying the problem space by removing unnecessary elements (e.g., substrings) can lead to more efficient solutions.
       - The official solution's use of Python's functional programming features (like decorators) can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.

    Overall, the official solution provides a more elegant and efficient approach to solving the problem, leveraging memoization and recursive strategies effectively. This experience highlights the importance of considering different algorithmic techniques and the potential benefits of simplifying the problem space before diving into complex implementations.

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1211 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to iteratively remove a specific substring ("abc") from a given string until it no longer appears. This required understanding how to efficiently search and modify strings in Python. The key function used was `str.replace()`, which allows for the removal of the first occurrence of a substring. This function was used in a loop to ensure all instances of "abc" were removed.

The main strategy was to use a while loop to repeatedly apply the `replace` method until the string stabilized (i.e., no more "abc" substrings were present). This approach is straightforward and effective for the given constraints, where the maximum string length is 1000 and the number of test cases is small.

The solution was implemented in a function `remove_abc_pairs`, which encapsulates the logic for removing "abc" substrings. Another function, `process_test_cases`, was used to handle multiple test cases, reading input and outputting results accordingly.

Overall, the problem reinforced the use of string manipulation techniques in Python and the importance of iterating until a stable state is reached. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def remove_abc_pairs(s):
    # Continuously remove "abc" from the string until it no longer exists
    while "abc" in s:
        s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)  # Remove the first occurrence of "abc"
    return s

def process_test_cases(test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        result = remove_abc_pairs(test_case)
        print(result)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])

# The following lines are the test cases
test_cases = data[1:T+1]

# Process each test case
process_test_cases(test_cases)
```

### Explanation

- **remove_abc_pairs**: This function takes a string and repeatedly removes the first occurrence of "abc" until no such substring is found.
- **process_test_cases**: This function iterates over each test case, applies the `remove_abc_pairs` function, and prints the result.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, which is typical for competitive programming. The first line contains the number of test cases, and the subsequent lines contain the strings to be processed.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
# cook your dish here
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s=input()
    while(s.count("abc")!=0):
        s=s.replace("abc","")
    print(s)    


INFO - [Task id] 1211 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of removing consecutive "abc" substrings from a given string until none remain. The key insight is to use a loop to repeatedly search for and remove the "abc" substring until it no longer exists in the string.

### Key Insights:

1. **Iterative Removal**: Both solutions use a loop to continuously remove "abc" from the string. This ensures that all occurrences are removed, even if new ones are formed after an initial removal.

2. **String Replacement**: The use of the `replace` method is crucial. It allows for the efficient removal of the first occurrence of "abc" in my solution, and all occurrences in the official solution. The difference is subtle but both achieve the same end result due to the loop.

3. **Efficiency Considerations**: The official solution uses `s.count("abc")` to check for the presence of "abc", which might be slightly less efficient than checking directly with `"abc" in s` as in my solution. However, given the constraints, both approaches are acceptable.

Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions are similar in approach and efficiency. The main takeaway is the effective use of string manipulation methods in Python to iteratively transform a string based on specific patterns.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the core concept was to iteratively remove a specific substring ("abc") from a given string until it no longer appears. This required understanding how to efficiently search and modify strings in Python. The key function used was `str.replace()`, which allows for the removal of t...,

[Problem]
    The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

    -----Constraints:-----
    $T \leq 2 $
    $1 \leq String length \leq 1000 $

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    aabcc
    bababccc

    -----Sample Output:-----
    ac
    bc

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    For 1) after removing "abc" at middle we get a new string as ac.
    For 2) string = bababccc
    newString1 = babcc  // After removing middle "abc"
    newString2 = bc   //After removing "abc"
