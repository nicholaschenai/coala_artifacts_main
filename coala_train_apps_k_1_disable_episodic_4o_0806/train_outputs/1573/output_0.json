    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. Each player plays against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties. If it's possible, we need to provide a scenario where this condition is met. If not, we should indicate that it's impossible.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - For a tournament with `N` players, each player plays `N-1` matches.\n   - We need to determine if it's possible for each player to win the same number of matches.\n\n2. **Feasibility Check**:\n   - If `N` is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches. This is because the total number of matches is `N * (N-1) / 2`, and if `N` is even, this number is not divisible by `N`, making it impossible for each player to have the same number of wins.\n   - If `N` is odd, it is possible. We can arrange the matches in a cyclic manner where each player wins against the next player in a circular fashion.\n\n3. **Constructing the Solution**:\n   - For odd `N`, construct a matrix where each player `i` wins against player `(i+1) % N`.\n   - This ensures that each player wins exactly one match.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction solve_tournament(T, test_cases):\n    for each N in test_cases:\n        if N is even:\n            print \"NO\"\n        else:\n            print \"YES\"\n            for i from 0 to N-1:\n                row = \"\"\n                for j from 0 to N-1:\n                    if i == j:\n                        row += \"0\"\n                    else if (i + 1) % N == j:\n                        row += \"1\"\n                    else:\n                        row += \"0\"\n                print row\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef solve_tournament(T, test_cases):\n    for N in test_cases:\n        if N % 2 == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            for i in range(N):\n                row = \"\"\n                for j in range(N):\n                    if i == j:\n                        row += \"0\"\n                    elif (i + 1) % N == j:\n                        row += \"1\"\n                    else:\n                        row += \"0\"\n                print(row)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\nsolve_tournament(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We first check if `N` is even or odd.\n- If `N` is even, we print \"NO\" because it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches.\n- If `N` is odd, we print \"YES\" and construct a matrix where each player `i` wins against player `(i+1) % N`.\n- This ensures that each player wins exactly one match, satisfying the condition for odd `N`.",
