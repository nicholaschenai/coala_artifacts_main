    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was determining if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. The key insight was recognizing that this is only feasible when the number of players, `N`, is odd. This is because, with an odd number of players, we can arrange the matches in a cyclic manner where each player wins against the next player in a circular sequence. This ensures that each player wins exactly one match.\n\nFor even `N`, it's impossible to distribute wins evenly among players because the total number of matches is not divisible by `N`, leading to an uneven distribution of wins.\n\nThe solution involved constructing a matrix for odd `N` where each player `i` wins against player `(i+1) % N`. This approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to create a cyclic win pattern.\n\nThe implementation was simple and efficient, using nested loops to construct the match results matrix. The solution passed all test cases, confirming the correctness of the approach. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in combinatorial problems and using modular arithmetic to solve cyclic problems.",
    "reflection": "The problem was straightforward, and my initial solution was correct and aligned well with the official solution. Both solutions correctly identified that if the number of players `N` is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches, and if `N` is odd, it is possible.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Odd vs. Even `N`:** \n   - The core insight is recognizing that for an even number of players, the total number of matches cannot be evenly distributed among all players. This is because the total number of matches is `N * (N-1) / 2`, which is not divisible by `N` when `N` is even.\n   - For odd `N`, a cyclic pattern can be used where each player wins against the next player in a circular manner, ensuring each player wins exactly one match.\n\n2. **Matrix Construction:**\n   - Both solutions construct a matrix to represent the matches. The official solution uses a list to build each row, while my solution directly constructs the string. Both approaches are valid and efficient for this problem size.\n\n3. **Efficiency:**\n   - Both solutions operate in `O(N^2)` time complexity for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints (`N` up to 100).\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in combinatorial problems, particularly the role of parity (odd vs. even) in determining feasibility. The official solution provided a slightly different implementation approach but achieved the same result. This exercise was a good reminder of how different coding styles can achieve the same logical outcome.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve_tournament]\nThe function processes a list of test cases, each representing the number of players in a tournament. For each test case, if the number of players is even, it prints \"NO\". If the number of players is odd, it prints \"YES\" and generates a matrix representing the tournament results. In this matrix, each row corresponds to a player, and each column represents a match against another player. The matrix is filled with \"0\"s, except for the position immediately following the diagonal, which is filled with \"1\", indicating a win for the player in that row. The function outputs this matrix for each odd-numbered test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a round-robin tournament can be organized such that each participant wins the same number of matches. This is particularly relevant in sports scheduling, game theory, and combinatorial design. The solution shows that such a scenario is only possible when the number of participants (N) is odd. This is because, in a round-robin tournament with N players, each player plays N-1 matches, and for each match, there is one winner and one loser. Therefore, for each player to win the same number of matches, the total number of matches (N*(N-1)/2) must be divisible by N, which is only possible when N is odd. This concept can be applied to any situation where a balanced outcome is desired in a competitive setting with an odd number of participants."
