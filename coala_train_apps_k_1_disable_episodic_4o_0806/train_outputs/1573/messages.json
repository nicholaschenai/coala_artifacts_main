If it's possible, we need to provide a specific arrangement of match outcomes. If not, we should indicate that it's impossible.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - Each player plays against every other player exactly once.\n   - There are no ties, so each match has a winner and a loser.\n   - We need to ensure that each player wins the same number of matches.\n\n2. **Feasibility Check**:\n   - For each player to win the same number of matches, the total number of matches (which is `N * (N - 1) / 2`) must be divisible by `N`. This is only possible if `N` is odd. If `N` is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches.\n\n3. **Constructing the Match Outcomes**:\n   - If `N` is odd, we can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly `(N - 1) / 2` matches.\n   - For each player `i`, they can win against the next `(N - 1) / 2` players in a cyclic manner.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the number of test cases `T`.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Read the number of players `N`.\n   - If `N` is even, print \"NO\".\n   - If `N` is odd:\n     - Print \"YES\".\n     - Initialize an `N x N` matrix with all zeros.\n     - For each player `i` from 0 to `N-1`:\n       - For the next `(N - 1) / 2` players, set the matrix entry to 1 indicating player `i` wins.\n     - Print the matrix.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        \n        if N % 2 == 0:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n            # Create an N x N matrix initialized with '0'\n            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]\n            \n            # Each player i wins against the next (N-1)/2 players\n            for i in range(N):\n                for j in range(1, (N // 2) + 1):\n                    winner = i\n                    loser = (i + j) % N\n                    matrix[winner][loser] = '1'\n            \n            for row in matrix:\n                results.append(''.join(row))\n    \n    # Print all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results according to the problem's requirements. It constructs a valid tournament scenario when possible and indicates when it's not possible."

The game rules allowed two types of moves: dividing by an odd divisor greater than 1 or subtracting 1. The challenge was to determine if the first player (Me) could always win given the initial number \\( N \\).\n\n    The core concept was recognizing that if \\( N \\) is even, the first player can always make it odd by subtracting 1, which generally puts the opponent in a disadvantageous position. Conversely, if \\( N \\) is odd, the first player can either subtract 1 to make it even or divide by an odd divisor, maintaining control over the game. The only exception is when \\( N = 1 \\), where the first player has no moves and loses immediately.\n\n    The solution involved a simple check:\n    - If \\( N = 1 \\), the first player loses.\n    - If \\( N \\) is even, the first player wins.\n    - If \\( N \\) is odd and greater than 1, the first player also wins.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of analyzing game states and leveraging parity to determine winning strategies. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was efficient, handling up to 100 test cases with numbers as large as \\( 10^9 \\).\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Both solutions correctly identified that if the number of players `N` is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches, and if `N` is odd, it is possible.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Odd vs. Even `N`:** \n   - The core insight is recognizing that for an even number of players, the total number of matches cannot be evenly distributed among all players. This is because the total number of matches is `N * (N-1) / 2`, which is not divisible by `N` when `N` is even.\n   - For odd `N`, a cyclic pattern can be used where each player wins against the next player in a circular manner, ensuring each player wins exactly one match.\n\n2. **Matrix Construction:**\n   - Both solutions construct a matrix to represent the matches. The official solution uses a list to build each row, while my solution directly constructs the string. Both approaches are valid and efficient for this problem size.\n\n3. **Efficiency:**\n   - Both solutions operate in `O(N^2)` time complexity for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints (`N` up to 100).\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in combinatorial problems, particularly the role of parity (odd vs. even) in determining feasibility. The official solution provided a slightly different implementation approach but achieved the same result.

For each test case, if the number of players is even, it prints \"NO\". If the number of players is odd, it prints \"YES\" and generates a matrix representing the tournament results. In this matrix, each row corresponds to a player, and each column represents a match against another player. The matrix is filled with \"0\"s, except for the position immediately following the diagonal, which is filled with \"1\", indicating a win for the player in that row. The function outputs this matrix for each odd-numbered test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a round-robin tournament can be organized such that each participant wins the same number of matches. This is particularly relevant in sports scheduling, game theory, and combinatorial design. The solution shows that such a scenario is only possible when the number of participants (N) is odd. This is because, in a round-robin tournament with N players, each player plays N-1 matches, and for each match, there is one winner and one loser. Therefore, for each player to win the same number of matches, the total number of matches (N*(N-1)/2) must be divisible by N, which is only possible when N is odd. This concept can be applied to any situation where a balanced outcome is desired in a competitive setting with an odd number of participants."
