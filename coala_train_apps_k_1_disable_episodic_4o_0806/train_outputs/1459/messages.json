The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to a given number \\( M \\). The task is to compute this perimeter with high precision.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope \\( M \\):**\n   - A line with slope \\( M \\) can be represented as \\( y = Mx + c \\).\n   - For a rectangle with one side having this slope, the opposite side will have the same slope, and the other two sides will have a slope of \\(-1/M\\) (perpendicular).\n\n2. **Transforming the Coordinate System:**\n   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope \\( M \\). This can be achieved using a transformation:\n     - New x-coordinate: \\( x' = x \\cos(\\theta) + y \\sin(\\theta) \\)\n     - New y-coordinate: \\( y' = -x \\sin(\\theta) + y \\cos(\\theta) \\)\n   - Here, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle whose tangent is \\( M \\), i.e., \\(\\theta = \\arctan(M)\\).\n\n3. **Finding the Bounding Rectangle:**\n   - After transformation, find the minimum and maximum values of the new x and y coordinates.\n   - The width of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.\n   - The height of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.\n\n4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**\n   - The perimeter of the rectangle is \\( 2 \\times (\\text{width} + \\text{height}) \\).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Read input values \\( N \\) and \\( M \\).\n2. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum transformed x and y coordinates.\n3. For each point:\n   - Compute the angle \\(\\theta = \\arctan(M)\\).\n   - Transform the point using the rotation formulas.\n   - Update the minimum and maximum transformed x and y coordinates.\n4. Calculate the width and height of the bounding rectangle.\n5. Compute the perimeter as \\( 2 \\times (\\text{width} + \\text{height}) \\).\n6. Print the perimeter with high precision.\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    M = float(data[1])\n    \n    # Calculate the angle theta\n    theta = math.atan(M)\n    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)\n    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)\n    \n    # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates\n    min_x_prime = float('inf')\n    max_x_prime = float('-inf')\n    min_y_prime = float('inf')\n    max_y_prime = float('-inf')\n    \n    index = 2\n    for _ in range(N):\n        x = float(data[index])\n        y = float(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        # Transform the coordinates\n        x_prime = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta\n        y_prime = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta\n        \n        # Update min and max for x' and y'\n        if x_prime < min_x_prime:\n            min_x_prime = x_prime\n        if x_prime > max_x_prime:\n            max_x_prime = x_prime\n        if y_prime < min_y_prime:\n            min_y_prime = y_prime\n        if y_prime > max_y_prime:\n            max_y_prime = y_prime\n    \n    # Calculate width and height of the rectangle\n    width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime\n    height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime\n    \n    # Calculate the perimeter\n    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)\n    \n    # Print the result with high precision\n    print(f\"{perimeter:.12f}\")\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, transforms the coordinates to align with the slope \\( M \\), calculates the bounding rectangle, and outputs the perimeter with high precision."

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Rotation Simplification**: The official solution cleverly uses trigonometric identities to rotate the coordinate system. By calculating the cosine and sine of the angle directly from the slope \\( M \\), it avoids the need to compute the angle using `atan`. This is done using:\n   - \\( \\text{cosx} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}} \\)\n   - \\( \\text{sinx} = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}} \\)\n\n2. **Coordinate Transformation**: Each point is transformed using these cosine and sine values to align the rectangle with the desired slope. This transformation is applied to both x and y coordinates:\n   - New x-coordinate: \\( \\text{cosx} \\times x + \\text{sinx} \\times y \\)\n   - New y-coordinate: \\( \\text{cosx} \\times y - \\text{sinx} \\times x \\)\n\n3. **Bounding Box Calculation**: After transforming all points, the solution calculates the minimum and maximum values for the new x and y coordinates. This allows for the determination of the width and height of the bounding rectangle.\n\n4. **Perimeter Calculation**: Finally, the perimeter is calculated using the formula \\( 2 \\times (\\text{width} + \\text{height}) \\).\n\nThe official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity, as it processes each point in constant time and uses a minimal amount of additional space. This approach is particularly well-suited for handling the large input sizes specified in the problem constraints. The use of direct trigonometric calculations to handle the rotation is a key insight that simplifies the problem significantly."

This is particularly relevant in computational geometry, computer graphics, and geographic information systems where spatial data needs to be enclosed or bounded by specific shapes. The problem also highlights the use of rotation transformations to align the rectangle with the desired slope, which is a common technique in geometry to simplify calculations.
