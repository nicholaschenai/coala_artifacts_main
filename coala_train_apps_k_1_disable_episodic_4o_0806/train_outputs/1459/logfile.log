INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a given set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to a given number \( M \). The task is to compute this perimeter with high precision.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope \( M \):**
   - A line with slope \( M \) can be represented as \( y = Mx + c \).
   - For a rectangle with one side having this slope, the opposite side will have the same slope, and the other two sides will have a slope of \(-1/M\) (perpendicular).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System:**
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope \( M \). This can be achieved using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: \( x' = x \cos(\theta) + y \sin(\theta) \)
     - New y-coordinate: \( y' = -x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta) \)
   - Here, \(\theta\) is the angle whose tangent is \( M \), i.e., \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).

3. **Finding the Bounding Rectangle:**
   - After transformation, find the minimum and maximum values of the new x and y coordinates.
   - The width of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
   - The height of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum transformed x and y coordinates.
3. For each point:
   - Compute the angle \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).
   - Transform the point using the rotation formulas.
   - Update the minimum and maximum transformed x and y coordinates.
4. Calculate the width and height of the bounding rectangle.
5. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

## Python Code

```python
import sys
import math

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = float(data[1])
    
    # Calculate the angle theta
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates
    min_x_prime = float('inf')
    max_x_prime = float('-inf')
    min_y_prime = float('inf')
    max_y_prime = float('-inf')
    
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = float(data[index])
        y = float(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Transform the coordinates
        x_prime = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta
        y_prime = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
        
        # Update min and max for x' and y'
        if x_prime < min_x_prime:
            min_x_prime = x_prime
        if x_prime > max_x_prime:
            max_x_prime = x_prime
        if y_prime < min_y_prime:
            min_y_prime = y_prime
        if y_prime > max_y_prime:
            max_y_prime = y_prime
    
    # Calculate width and height of the rectangle
    width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
    height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    
    # Print the result with high precision
    print(f"{perimeter:.12f}")

main()
```

This code reads the input, transforms the coordinates to align with the slope \( M \), calculates the bounding rectangle, and outputs the perimeter with high precision.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Today, Chef has a fencing job at hand and has to fence up a surface covering N$N$ points. 
To minimize his work, he started looking for an algorithm that had him fence the least amount of length.

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains two integers N$N$ and M$M$, the number of points and the Chef's favourite Number.
- The next n lines contain two space separated integers X$X$ and Y$Y$, the coordinates of the point.

-----Output:-----
Print a single decimal number, denoting the perimeter of the rectangle. Answer will considered correct if it has absolute error less than 10âˆ’6$10^{-6}$.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] In this problem, the main challenge was to compute the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a set of points, with one side having a specific slope M. The key concept here was to rotate the coordinate system so that one of the axes aligns with the slope M. This allowed us to transform the problem into finding the axis-aligned bounding box in the rotated coordinate system.

The solution involved:
1. Calculating the angle of rotation using the arctangent of M.
2. Using trigonometric functions to rotate each point in the dataset.
3. Determining the minimum and maximum values of the rotated coordinates to define the bounding rectangle.
4. Calculating the perimeter of this rectangle.

A critical insight was handling the case where M is infinite, which corresponds to a vertical line. In this scenario, the bounding box is simply the axis-aligned rectangle in the original coordinate system.

The implementation used efficient input handling and mathematical operations to ensure the solution could handle the upper constraint limits. The use of trigonometric functions and careful handling of floating-point precision were essential to meet the problem's accuracy requirements. This problem reinforced the importance of geometric transformations and precision handling in computational geometry tasks.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, the official solution provided a more efficient and straightforward approach to calculating the minimum perimeter of a rectangle with a given slope. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Rotation Simplification**: The official solution cleverly uses trigonometric identities to rotate the coordinate system. By calculating the cosine and sine of the angle directly from the slope \( M \), it avoids the need to compute the angle using `atan`. This is done using:
   - \( \text{cosx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + M^2}} \)
   - \( \text{sinx} = \frac{M}{\sqrt{1 + M^2}} \)

2. **Coordinate Transformation**: Each point is transformed using these cosine and sine values to align the rectangle with the desired slope. This transformation is applied to both x and y coordinates:
   - New x-coordinate: \( \text{cosx} \times x + \text{sinx} \times y \)
   - New y-coordinate: \( \text{cosx} \times y - \text{sinx} \times x \)

3. **Bounding Box Calculation**: After transforming all points, the solution calculates the minimum and maximum values for the new x and y coordinates. This allows for the determination of the width and height of the bounding rectangle.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: Finally, the perimeter is calculated using the formula \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).

The official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity, as it processes each point in constant time and uses a minimal amount of additional space. This approach is particularly well-suited for handling the large input sizes specified in the problem constraints. The use of direct trigonometric calculations to handle the rotation is a key insight that simplifies the problem significantly.

The main function is `main`.
INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes an integer N representing the number of points, a float M representing the slope of a line, and a list of N points with their x and y coordinates. It then calls another function to calculate the perimeter of the smallest rectangle that can enclose all the given points when rotated to align with the line of slope M. The result, which is the calculated perimeter, is printed with a precision of 12 decimal places.

[Problem]
    Today, Chef has a fencing job at hand and has to fence up a surface covering N$N$ points. 
    To minimize his work, he started looking for an algorithm that had him fence the least amount of length. 
    He came up with the Convex Hull algorithm, but soon realized it gave him some random shape to fence. However, Chef likes rectangles and has a favourite number M$M$. 
    Help him find the minimum perimeter he has to fence if he wants to fence a rectangle, with slope of one of the sides as M$M$, to cover all the points.

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line contains two integers N$N$ and M$M$, the number of points and the Chef's favourite Number.
    - The next n lines contain two space separated integers X$X$ and Y$Y$, the coordinates of the point.

    -----Output:-----
    Print a single decimal number, denoting the perimeter of the rectangle. Answer will considered correct if it has absolute error less than 10âˆ’6$10^{-6}$.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 2â‰¤Nâ‰¤1000000$2 \leq N \leq 1000000$
    - âˆ’1000â‰¤Mâ‰¤1000$-1000 \leq M \leq 1000$
    - âˆ’1000000â‰¤Xâ‰¤1000000$-1000000 \leq X \leq 1000000$
    - âˆ’1000000â‰¤Yâ‰¤1000000$-1000000 \leq Y \leq 1000000$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    4 1
    0 1
    0 -1
    1 0
    -1 0

    -----Sample Output:-----
    5.656854249492380

    -----Note:-----
    - As the input size is large, it is recommended to use Fast IO.
