    "summary": "In this problem, the main challenge was to compute the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a set of points, with one side having a specific slope M. The key concept here was to rotate the coordinate system so that one of the axes aligns with the slope M. This allowed us to transform the problem into finding the axis-aligned bounding box in the rotated coordinate system.\n\nThe solution involved:\n1. Calculating the angle of rotation using the arctangent of M.\n2. Using trigonometric functions to rotate each point in the dataset.\n3. Determining the minimum and maximum values of the rotated coordinates to define the bounding rectangle.\n4. Calculating the perimeter of this rectangle.\n\nA critical insight was handling the case where M is infinite, which corresponds to a vertical line. In this scenario, the bounding box is simply the axis-aligned rectangle in the original coordinate system.\n\nThe implementation used efficient input handling and mathematical operations to ensure the solution could handle the upper constraint limits. The use of trigonometric functions and careful handling of floating-point precision were essential to meet the problem's accuracy requirements. This problem reinforced the importance of geometric transformations and precision handling in computational geometry tasks.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, the official solution provided a more efficient and straightforward approach to calculating the minimum perimeter of a rectangle with a given slope. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Rotation Simplification**: The official solution cleverly uses trigonometric identities to rotate the coordinate system. By calculating the cosine and sine of the angle directly from the slope \\( M \\), it avoids the need to compute the angle using `atan`. This is done using:\n   - \\( \\text{cosx} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}} \\)\n   - \\( \\text{sinx} = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}} \\)\n\n2. **Coordinate Transformation**: Each point is transformed using these cosine and sine values to align the rectangle with the desired slope. This transformation is applied to both x and y coordinates:\n   - New x-coordinate: \\( \\text{cosx} \\times x + \\text{sinx} \\times y \\)\n   - New y-coordinate: \\( \\text{cosx} \\times y - \\text{sinx} \\times x \\)\n\n3. **Bounding Box Calculation**: After transforming all points, the solution calculates the minimum and maximum values for the new x and y coordinates. This allows for the determination of the width and height of the bounding rectangle.\n\n4. **Perimeter Calculation**: Finally, the perimeter is calculated using the formula \\( 2 \\times (\\text{width} + \\text{height}) \\).\n\nThe official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity, as it processes each point in constant time and uses a minimal amount of additional space. This approach is particularly well-suited for handling the large input sizes specified in the problem constraints. The use of direct trigonometric calculations to handle the rotation is a key insight that simplifies the problem significantly.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes an integer N representing the number of points, a float M representing the slope of a line, and a list of N points with their x and y coordinates. It then calls another function to calculate the perimeter of the smallest rectangle that can enclose all the given points when rotated to align with the line of slope M. The result, which is the calculated perimeter, is printed with a precision of 12 decimal places.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to calculate the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that encloses a set of points, with the constraint that one side of the rectangle has a specific slope. This is particularly relevant in computational geometry, computer graphics, and geographic information systems where spatial data needs to be enclosed or bounded by specific shapes. The problem also highlights the use of rotation transformations to align the rectangle with the desired slope, which is a common technique in geometry to simplify calculations. Additionally, understanding how to handle large input sizes efficiently with fast I/O is crucial in competitive programming and real-time data processing applications."
