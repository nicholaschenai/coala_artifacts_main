Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.\n\nYou are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.\n\nNow consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).\n\nEach test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.\n\nAs stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.\n\nTest cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n1 1 2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2 1 2\n\n5\n0\n0\n0\n2 1 2\n1 3 4\n\nOutput:\n\n0.50000\n0.29289\n0.70711\n0.40303\n\n-----Temporary Stuff-----\n\nA horizontal rule follows.\n\n***\n\nHere's a definition list (with `definitionLists` option):\n\napples\n: Good for making applesauce.\noranges\n: Citrus!\ntomatoes\n: There's no \"e\" in tomatoe.\n\n#PRACTICE\n- This must be done\n[http:codechef.com/users/dpraveen](http:codechef.com/users/dpraveen)\n\n(0.8944272\u22120.44721360.4472136\u22120.8944272)(10005)(0.89442720.4472136\u22120.4472136\u22120.8944272)(10005)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n0.8944272 & 0.4472136\\\\\n-0.4472136 & -0.8944272\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n10 & 0\\\\ \n0 & 5\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output of the circuit is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND or OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.\n\n2. **Probability Calculation**: For each node, calculate the probability that it outputs 1. For input nodes, this is simply `p`. For OR gates, the probability is `1 - (1 - P(a)) * (1 - P(b))`, where `P(a)` and `P(b)` are the probabilities that the inputs to the gate are 1. For AND gates, the probability is `P(a) * P(b)`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for `p`**: Use binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.

The core concept involved efficiently updating scores for a range of students and calculating the mean of these scores.\n\n    Initially, the main issue was that the `main()` function was not being called, which resulted in no output being produced. This is a common oversight when defining a main function in a script. The solution was to ensure that the `main()` function is called by using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct, which is a standard practice in Python to execute code only when the script is run directly.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved:\n    1. Initializing all student scores to 10.\n    2. Iterating over each question and updating the scores for the specified range of students by multiplying their scores by the question's complexity.\n    3. Calculating the total score and deriving the floor of the mean score for output.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of correctly handling input and output in competitive programming environments, especially when dealing with large input sizes. It also highlighted the need to ensure that the main execution logic is properly invoked in scripts.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The task is to find the value of `p` such that this probability is exactly 0.5.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\n1. **Probability Calculation**: The main challenge was correctly calculating the probability for each node based on its type (input, OR gate, or AND gate). The formula for OR gates is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`, and for AND gates, it is `P(a) * P(b)`. Ensuring these calculations were correctly applied to the circuit structure was crucial.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: The strategy of using binary search to find the correct `p` was appropriate. The search adjusts `low` and `high` based on whether the calculated probability is greater or less than 0.5. The precision of the search was controlled by a small epsilon value.\n\n#### Errors and Fixes\n- **Function Call**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by adding the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct.\n- **Incorrect Probability Results**: The output for some test cases was incorrect, indicating issues with the probability calculations or binary search logic. Ensuring the correct application of probability rules and verifying the logic with known test cases helped address these issues.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n- **Debugging Complex Logic**: When dealing with complex logic, such as probability calculations in circuits, it's essential to verify each step with known values.\n- **Binary Search Precision**: Ensuring the binary search is precise enough to meet the problem's requirements is crucial, especially when dealing with floating-point numbers.\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of careful implementation and testing of mathematical logic in programming problems."

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\nThe problem involves determining the probability `p` such that a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates outputs a 1 with a probability of 0.5. The challenge lies in correctly modeling the circuit and using binary search to find the appropriate `p`.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Node Representation**: The official solution uses a class `node` to represent each node in the circuit. This encapsulates the type of node (input, AND, OR) and its connections, making it easier to manage and access node properties.\n\n2. **Recursive Probability Calculation**: The `finder` function recursively calculates the probability of a node being 1. This function handles the logic for both AND and OR gates, using the properties of the node to determine the correct calculation. This recursive approach ensures that the dependencies between nodes are correctly handled.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Probability `p`**: The solution uses binary search to find the value of `p` that results in the output node having a probability of 0.5. The precision of the search is controlled by a small epsilon value (`1e-9`), ensuring an accurate result.\n\n4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The solution efficiently handles multiple test cases by resetting the node array after each test case, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.\n\n#### Why My Approach Failed:\n\n- **Probability Calculation**: My initial approach did not correctly handle the recursive dependencies between nodes. The official solution's use of a recursive function to calculate probabilities ensures that all dependencies are correctly accounted for.\n\n- **Binary Search Logic**: While my binary search logic was conceptually correct, the precision and handling of the search bounds were not as robust as in the official solution.\n\n- **Node Management**: The use of a class to represent nodes in the official solution provides a clear and organized way to manage node properties and connections, which was lacking in my approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe official solution provides a clear and efficient approach to solving the problem by using a recursive function to handle node dependencies and a precise binary search to find the correct probability `p`. This experience highlights the importance of correctly modeling problem components and ensuring that all dependencies are accounted for in calculations."
