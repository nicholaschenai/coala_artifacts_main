## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output of the circuit is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND or OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.

2. **Probability Calculation**: For each node, calculate the probability that it outputs 1. For input nodes, this is simply `p`. For OR gates, the probability is `1 - (1 - P(a)) * (1 - P(b))`, where `P(a)` and `P(b)` are the probabilities that the inputs to the gate are 1. For AND gates, the probability is `P(a) * P(b)`.

3. **Binary Search for `p`**: Use binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. Start with `p` in the range [0, 1] and iteratively adjust based on the calculated probability of the output node.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_p_for_half_probability(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        n = number of nodes
        nodes = list of node descriptions
        
        define function calculate_probability(p):
            probabilities = array of size n
            for i from 0 to n-1:
                if nodes[i] is input:
                    probabilities[i] = p
                else if nodes[i] is OR gate:
                    a, b = inputs to the gate
                    probabilities[i] = 1 - (1 - probabilities[a]) * (1 - probabilities[b])
                else if nodes[i] is AND gate:
                    a, b = inputs to the gate
                    probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
            return probabilities[n-1]
        
        low = 0.0
        high = 1.0
        while high - low > 1e-6:
            mid = (low + high) / 2
            if calculate_probability(mid) < 0.5:
                low = mid
            else:
                high = mid
        
        print the value of p with 5 decimal places
```

## Python Code

```python
def find_p_for_half_probability(test_cases):
    results = []
    for nodes in test_cases:
        n = len(nodes)
        
        def calculate_probability(p):
            probabilities = [0] * n
            for i in range(n):
                if nodes[i][0] == 0:  # Input node
                    probabilities[i] = p
                elif nodes[i][0] == 1:  # OR gate
                    a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
                    probabilities[i] = 1 - (1 - probabilities[a]) * (1 - probabilities[b])
                elif nodes[i][0] == 2:  # AND gate
                    a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
                    probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
            return probabilities[-1]
        
        low, high = 0.0, 1.0
        while high - low > 1e-6:
            mid = (low + high) / 2
            if calculate_probability(mid) < 0.5:
                low = mid
            else:
                high = mid
        
        results.append(f"{low:.5f}")
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# test_cases = [
#     [(0,)],  # Single input node
#     [(0,), (0,), (1, 1, 2)],  # OR gate
#     [(0,), (0,), (2, 1, 2)],  # AND gate
#     [(0,), (0,), (0,), (2, 1, 2), (1, 3, 4)]  # Mixed gates
# ]
# print(find_p_for_half_probability(test_cases))
```

This code defines a function `find_p_for_half_probability` that takes a list of test cases, each representing a circuit, and returns the value of `p` for each circuit such that the output node has a probability of 1/2. The function uses binary search to find the correct `p` value.

AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

    Chapter: Probability
    Section: Calculation
    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{Probability}

    \index{probability}

    A \key{probability} is a real number between $0$ and $1$
    that indicates how probable an event is.
    If an event is certain to happen,
    its probability is 1,
    and if an event is impossible,
    its probability is 0.
    The probability of an event is denoted $P(\cdots)$
    where the three dots describe the event.

    For example, when throwing a dice,
    the outcome is an integer between $1$ and $6$,
    and the probability of each outcome is $1/6$.
    For example, we can calculate the following probabilities:

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item $P(\textrm{''the outcome is 4''})=1/6$
    \item $P(\textrm{''the outcome is not 6''})=5/6$
    \item $P(\textrm{''the outcome is even''})=1/2$
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Calculation}

    To calculate the probability of an event,
    we can either use combinatorics
    or simulate the process that generates the event.
    As an example, let us calculate the probability
    of drawing three cards with the same value
    from a shuffled deck of cards
    (for example, $\spadesuit 8$, $\clubsuit 8$ and $\diamondsuit 8$).

    \subsubsection*{Method 1}

    We can calculate the probability using the formula

    \[\frac{\textrm{number of desired outcomes}}{\textrm{total number of outcomes}}.\]

    In this problem, the desired outcomes are those
    in which the value of each card is the same.
    There are $13 {4 \choose 3}$ such outcomes,
    because there are $13$ possibilities for the
    value of the cards and ${4 \choose 3}$ ways to
    choose $3$ suits from $4$ possible suits.

    There are a total of ${52 \choose 3}$ outcomes,
    because we choose 3 cards from 52 cards.
    Thus, the probability of the event is

    \[\frac{13 {4 \choose 3}}{{52 \choose 3}} = \frac{1}{425}.\]

    \subsubsection*{Method 2}

    Another way to calculate the probability is
    to simulate the process that generates the event.
    In this example, we draw three cards, so the process
    consists of three steps.
    We require that each step of the process is successful.

    Drawing the first card certainly succeeds,
    because there are no restrictions.
    The second step succeeds with probability $3/51$,
    because there are 51 cards left and 3 of them
    have the same value as the first card.
    In a similar way, the third step succeeds with probability $2/50$.

    The probability that the entire process succeeds is

    \[1 \cdot \frac{3}{51} \cdot \frac{2}{50} = \frac{1}{425}.\]

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND/OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.
   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.

3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. We can use binary search over `p` in the range [0, 1] to find this value.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of nodes.
   - Initialize a list to store the probability of each node being 1.
   - For each node, determine if it's an input or a gate and store the necessary information.
   - Use binary search to find the value of `p`:
     - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 1.
     - While the difference between `low` and `high` is greater than a small epsilon (e.g., 1e-6):
       - Set `mid` to the average of `low` and `high`.
       - Calculate the probability of each node being 1 using `mid` as the probability for input nodes.
       - If the probability of the output node is greater than 0.5, set `high` to `mid`.
       - Otherwise, set `low` to `mid`.
   - The value of `p` is the average of `low` and `high`.
3. Print the value of `p` for each test case with 5 decimal places.

### Python Code

 ### Problem Restatement

We are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND/OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.
   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.

3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. We can use binary search over `p` in the range [0, 1] to find this value.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of nodes.
   - Initialize a list to store the probability of each node being 1.
   - For each node, determine if it's an input or a gate and store the necessary information.
   - Use binary search to find the value of `p`:
     - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 1.
     - While the difference between `low` and `high` is greater than a small epsilon (e.g., 1e-6):
       - Set `mid` to the average of `low` and `high`.
       - Calculate the probability of each node being 1 using `mid` as the probability for input nodes.
       - If the probability of the output node is greater than 0.5, set `high` to `mid`.
       - Otherwise, set `low` to `mid`.
   - The value of `p` is the average of `low` and `high`.
3. Print the value of `p` for each test case with 5 decimal places.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----
Input:

5

We are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND/OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.
   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.

3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. We can use binary search over `p` in the range [0, 1] to find this value.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of nodes.
   - Initialize a list to store the probability of each node being 1.
   - For each node, determine if it's an input or a gate and store the necessary information.
   - Use binary search to find the value of `p`:
     - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 1.
     - While the difference between `low` and `high` is greater than a small epsilon (e.g., 1e-6):
       - Set `mid` to the average of `low` and `high`.
       - Calculate the probability of each node being 1 using `mid` as the probability for input nodes.
       - If the probability of the output node is greater than 0.5, set `high` to `mid`.
       - Otherwise, set `low` to `mid`.
   - The value of `p` is the average of `low` and `high`.
3. Print the value of `p` for each test case with 5 decimal places.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [generation text] ### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into lines. This is correct for handling multiple lines of input.

2. **Parsing Test Cases**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases and iterates over them. It also handles blank lines between test cases.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The code reads the number of nodes and then reads each node's description.
   - It stores the node information in a list called `nodes`.

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - It calculates the probability of each node being 1 using the `calculate_probability` function.

5. **Output**:
   - The code stores the result for each test case and prints it with 5 decimal places.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when using `sys.stdin.read()` for input. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Output Handling**: The code should ensure that the output is printed correctly. Since the function is not called, no output is generated.

3. **Precision**: The binary search precision (`epsilon`) is set to `1e-7`, which is fine, but we need to ensure that the final result is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called to execute the logic and produce output.

2. **Check Output Formatting**: Ensure that the output is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Double-check the logic for calculating probabilities and ensure that the binary search is correctly implemented.

### Revised Code

```python
def calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):
    probabilities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if nodes[i][0] == 0:
            probabilities[i] = p
        elif nodes[i][0] == 1:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] + probabilities[b] - probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----
Input:

4

0
1 1 2

3
0
0
2 1 2

5
0
0
0
2 1 2
1 3 4

Output:

0.50000
0.29289
0.70711
0.40303

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND/OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.
   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.

3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. We can use binary search over `p` in the range [0, 1] to find this value.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of nodes.
   - Initialize a list to store the probability of each node being 1.
   - For each node, determine if it's an input or a gate and store the necessary information.
   - Use binary search to find the value of `p`:
     - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 1.
     - While the difference between `low` and `high` is greater than a small epsilon (e.g., 1e-6):
       - Set `mid` to the average of `low` and `high`.
       - Calculate the probability of each node being 1 using `mid` as the probability for input nodes.
       - If the probability of the output node is greater than 0.5, set `high` to `mid`.
       - Otherwise, set `low` to `mid`.
   - The value of `p` is the average of `low` and `high`.
3. Print the value of `p` for each test case with 5 decimal places.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into lines. This is correct for handling multiple lines of input.

2. **Parsing Test Cases**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases and iterates over them. It also handles blank lines between test cases.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The code reads the number of nodes and then reads each node's description.
   - It stores the node information in a list called `nodes`.

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - It calculates the probability of each node being 1 using the `calculate_probability` function.

5. **Output**:
   - The code stores the result for each test case and prints it with 5 decimal places.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when using `sys.stdin.read()` for input. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Output Handling**: The code should ensure that the output is printed correctly. Since the function is not called, no output is generated.

3. **Precision**: The binary search precision (`epsilon`) is set to `1e-7`, which is fine, but we need to ensure that the final result is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called to execute the logic and produce output.

2. **Check Output Formatting**: Ensure that the output is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Double-check the logic for calculating probabilities and ensure that the binary search is correctly implemented.

### Revised Code

```python
def calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):
    probabilities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if nodes[i][0] == 0:
            probabilities[i] = p
        elif nodes[i][0] == 1:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] + probabilities[b] - probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of maximum possible scores for students after they solve a series of questions, with each question affecting a range of students' scores. The core concept involved efficiently updating scores for a range of students and calculating the mean of these scores.

    Initially, the main issue was that the `main()` function was not being called, which resulted in no output being produced. This is a common oversight when defining a main function in a script. The solution was to ensure that the `main()` function is called by using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct, which is a standard practice in Python to execute code only when the script is run directly.

    The strategy that worked involved:
    1. Initializing all student scores to 10.
    2. Iterating over each question and updating the scores for the specified range of students by multiplying their scores by the question's complexity.
    3. Calculating the total score and deriving the floor of the mean score for output.

    This problem reinforced the importance of correctly handling input and output in competitive programming environments, especially when dealing with large input sizes. It also highlighted the need to ensure that the main execution logic is properly invoked in scripts.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND/OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.
   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.

3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. We can use binary search over `p` in the range [0, 1] to find this value.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of nodes.
   - Initialize a list to store the probability of each node being 1.
   - For each node, determine if it's an input or a gate and store the necessary information.
   - Use binary search to find the value of `p`:
     - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 1.
     - While the difference between `low` and `high` is greater than a small epsilon (e.g., 1e-6):
       - Set `mid` to the average of `low` and `high`.
       - Calculate the probability of each node being 1 using `mid` as the probability for input nodes.
       - If the probability of the output node is greater than 0.5, set `high` to `mid`.
       - Otherwise, set `low` to `mid`.
   - The value of `p` is the average of `low` and `high`.
3. Print the value of `p` for each test case with 5 decimal places.

### Python Code

```python
def calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):
    probabilities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if nodes[i][0] == 0:

        elif nodes[i][0] == 1:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] + probabilities[b] - probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into lines. This is correct for handling multiple lines of input.

2. **Parsing Test Cases**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases and iterates over them. It also handles blank lines between test cases.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The code reads the number of nodes and then reads each node's description.
   - It stores the node information in a list called `nodes`.

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - It calculates the probability of each node being 1 using the `calculate_probability` function.

5. **Output**:
   - The code stores the result for each test case and prints it with 5 decimal places.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when using `sys.stdin.read()` for input. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Output Handling**: The code should ensure that the output is printed correctly. Since the function is not called, no output is generated.

3. **Precision**: The binary search precision (`epsilon`) is set to `1e-7`, which is fine, but we need to ensure that the final result is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called to execute the logic and produce output.

2. **Check Output Formatting**: Ensure that the output is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Double-check the logic for calculating probabilities and ensure that the binary search is correctly implemented.

### Revised Code

```python
def calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):
    probabilities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if nodes[i][0] == 0:

            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] + probabilities[b] - probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - The binary search logic seems correct, but the results indicate an issue with the probability calculations.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Probability Calculation**: The logic for calculating probabilities might not be correctly applied to the circuit structure. Specifically, the handling of OR and AND gates might not be correctly reflecting the dependencies between nodes.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search might not be correctly adjusting `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Output**: The output for some test cases is incorrect, indicating a deeper issue with the logic or calculations.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Re-evaluate Probability Calculations**: Ensure that the probability calculations for OR and AND gates are correctly implemented and reflect the circuit's structure.

2. **Debug Binary Search**: Verify that the binary search correctly adjusts `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities.

3. **Test with Known Values**: Use known test cases to verify the correctness of the probability calculations and binary search.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND/OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.
   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.

3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. We can use binary search over `p` in the range [0, 1] to find this value.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of nodes.
   - Initialize a list to store the probability of each node being 1.
   - For each node, determine if it's an input or a gate and store the necessary information.
   - Use binary search to find the value of `p`:
     - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 1.
     - While the difference between `low` and `high` is greater than a small epsilon (e.g., 1e-6):
       - Set `mid` to the average of `low` and `high`.
       - Calculate the probability of each node being 1 using `mid` as the probability for input nodes.
       - If the probability of the output node is greater than 0.5, set `high` to `mid`.
       - Otherwise, set `low` to `mid`.
   - The value of `p` is the average of `low` and `high`.
3. Print the value of `p` for each test case with 5 decimal places.

### Python Code

    probabilities = [0] * n

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into lines. This is correct for handling multiple lines of input.

2. **Parsing Test Cases**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases and iterates over them. It also handles blank lines between test cases.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The code reads the number of nodes and then reads each node's description.
   - It stores the node information in a list called `nodes`.

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - It calculates the probability of each node being 1 using the `calculate_probability` function.

5. **Output**:
   - The code stores the result for each test case and prints it with 5 decimal places.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when using `sys.stdin.read()` for input. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Output Handling**: The code should ensure that the output is printed correctly. Since the function is not called, no output is generated.

3. **Precision**: The binary search precision (`epsilon`) is set to `1e-7`, which is fine, but we need to ensure that the final result is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called to execute the logic and produce output.

2. **Check Output Formatting**: Ensure that the output is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Double-check the logic for calculating probabilities and ensure that the binary search is correctly implemented.

### Revised Code

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - The binary search logic seems correct, but the results indicate an issue with the probability calculations.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Probability Calculation**: The logic for calculating probabilities might not be correctly applied to the circuit structure. Specifically, the handling of OR and AND gates might not be correctly reflecting the dependencies between nodes.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search might not be correctly adjusting `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Output**: The output for some test cases is incorrect, indicating a deeper issue with the logic or calculations.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Re-evaluate Probability Calculations**: Ensure that the probability calculations for OR and AND gates are correctly implemented and reflect the circuit's structure.

2. **Debug Binary Search**: Verify that the binary search correctly adjusts `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities.

3. **Test with Known Values**: Use known test cases to verify the correctness of the probability calculations and binary search.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of maximum possible scores for students after they solve a series of questions, with each question affecting a range of students' scores. The core concept involved efficiently updating scores for a range of students and calculating the mean of these scores.

    Initially, the main issue was that the `main()` function was not being called, which resulted in no output being produced. This is a common oversight when defining a main function in a script. The solution was to ensure that the `main()` function is called by using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct, which is a standard practice in Python to execute code only when the script is run directly.

    The strategy that worked involved:
    1. Initializing all student scores to 10.
    2. Iterating over each question and updating the scores for the specified range of students by multiplying their scores by the question's complexity.
    3. Calculating the total score and deriving the floor of the mean score for output.

    This problem reinforced the importance of correctly handling input and output in competitive programming environments, especially when dealing with large input sizes. It also highlighted the need to ensure that the main execution logic is properly invoked in scripts.

### Key Fixes:
1. **Probability Calculation**: Ensure that the probability calculations for OR and AND gates are correctly implemented. The logic for OR and AND gates is based on the correct application of probability rules.

2. **Binary Search**: The binary search logic is correctly implemented to find the value of `p` that results in the output node having a probability of 0.5.

3. **Output Formatting**: The results are formatted to exactly 5 decimal places, as required by the problem statement.

This code should now correctly handle the input and output, and produce the expected results for each test case.

 Let's address the issues identified in the previous analysis and ensure the code correctly calculates the probability for each test case. The main problem seems to be with the logic for calculating probabilities and the binary search implementation. Let's fix these issues and ensure the code outputs the correct results.

```python
def calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):
    probabilities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if nodes[i][0] == 0:
            probabilities[i] = p
        elif nodes[i][0] == 1:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] + probabilities[b] - probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
    return probabilities[-1]

            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    return (low + high) / 2

```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Probability Calculation**: Ensure that the probability calculations for OR and AND gates are correctly implemented. The logic for OR and AND gates is based on the correct application of probability rules.

2. **Binary Search**: The binary search logic is correctly implemented to find the value of `p` that results in the output node having a probability of 0.5.

3. **Output Formatting**: The results are formatted to exactly 5 decimal places, as required by the problem statement.

This code should now correctly handle the input and output, and produce the expected results for each test case.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----
Input:

4

0

3

0
1 1 2

3
0
0
2 1 2

5
0

2 1 2

Output:

0.29289
0.70711
0.40303

-----Temporary Stuff-----

A horizontal rule follows.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND/OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.
   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.

3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. We can use binary search over `p` in the range [0, 1] to find this value.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of nodes.
   - Initialize a list to store the probability of each node being 1.
   - For each node, determine if it's an input or a gate and store the necessary information.
   - Use binary search to find the value of `p`:
     - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 1.
     - While the difference between `low` and `high` is greater than a small epsilon (e.g., 1e-6):
       - Set `mid` to the average of `low` and `high`.
       - Calculate the probability of each node being 1 using `mid` as the probability for input nodes.
       - If the probability of the output node is greater than 0.5, set `high` to `mid`.
       - Otherwise, set `low` to `mid`.
   - The value of `p` is the average of `low` and `high`.
3. Print the value of `p` for each test case with 5 decimal places.

### Python Code

```python
def calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):
    probabilities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if nodes[i][0] == 0:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into lines. This is correct for handling multiple lines of input.

2. **Parsing Test Cases**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases and iterates over them. It also handles blank lines between test cases.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The code reads the number of nodes and then reads each node's description.
   - It stores the node information in a list called `nodes`.

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - It calculates the probability of each node being 1 using the `calculate_probability` function.

5. **Output**:
   - The code stores the result for each test case and prints it with 5 decimal places.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when using `sys.stdin.read()` for input. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Output Handling**: The code should ensure that the output is printed correctly. Since the function is not called, no output is generated.

3. **Precision**: The binary search precision (`epsilon`) is set to `1e-7`, which is fine, but we need to ensure that the final result is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called to execute the logic and produce output.

2. **Check Output Formatting**: Ensure that the output is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Double-check the logic for calculating probabilities and ensure that the binary search is correctly implemented.

### Revised Code

```python
def calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):
    probabilities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if nodes[i][0] == 0:
            probabilities[i] = p

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into lines. It handles multiple test cases and blank lines between them.

2. **Parsing Test Cases**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases and iterates over them. It reads the number of nodes and each node's description.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For input nodes, the probability is set to `p`.
   - For OR gates, the probability is calculated as `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For AND gates, the probability is calculated as `P(a) * P(b)`.

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - The binary search logic seems correct, but the results indicate an issue with the probability calculations.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Probability Calculation**: The logic for calculating probabilities might not be correctly applied to the circuit structure. Specifically, the handling of OR and AND gates might not be correctly reflecting the dependencies between nodes.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search might not be correctly adjusting `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Output**: The output for some test cases is incorrect, indicating a deeper issue with the logic or calculations.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Re-evaluate Probability Calculations**: Ensure that the probability calculations for OR and AND gates are correctly implemented and reflect the circuit's structure.

2. **Debug Binary Search**: Verify that the binary search correctly adjusts `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities.

3. **Test with Known Values**: Use known test cases to verify the correctness of the probability calculations and binary search.

### Key Fixes:
1. **Probability Calculation**: Ensure that the probability calculations for OR and AND gates are correctly implemented. The logic for OR and AND gates is based on the correct application of probability rules.

2. **Binary Search**: The binary search logic is correctly implemented to find the value of `p` that results in the output node having a probability of 0.5.

3. **Output Formatting**: The results are formatted to exactly 5 decimal places, as required by the problem statement.

This code should now correctly handle the input and output, and produce the expected results for each test case.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----
Input:

4

3

0
1 1 2

3
0
0
2 1 2

5

2 1 2

Output:

4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND/OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.
   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.

3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. We can use binary search over `p` in the range [0, 1] to find this value.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of nodes.
   - Initialize a list to store the probability of each node being 1.
   - For each node, determine if it's an input or a gate and store the necessary information.
   - Use binary search to find the value of `p`:
     - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 1.
     - While the difference between `low` and `high` is greater than a small epsilon (e.g., 1e-6):
       - Set `mid` to the average of `low` and `high`.
       - Calculate the probability of each node being 1 using `mid` as the probability for input nodes.
       - If the probability of the output node is greater than 0.5, set `high` to `mid`.
       - Otherwise, set `low` to `mid`.
   - The value of `p` is the average of `low` and `high`.
3. Print the value of `p` for each test case with 5 decimal places.

   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - It calculates the probability of each node being 1 using the `calculate_probability` function.

5. **Output**:
   - The code stores the result for each test case and prints it with 5 decimal places.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when using `sys.stdin.read()` for input. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Output Handling**: The code should ensure that the output is printed correctly. Since the function is not called, no output is generated.

3. **Precision**: The binary search precision (`epsilon`) is set to `1e-7`, which is fine, but we need to ensure that the final result is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called to execute the logic and produce output.

2. **Check Output Formatting**: Ensure that the output is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Double-check the logic for calculating probabilities and ensure that the binary search is correctly implemented.

### Revised Code

            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] + probabilities[b] - probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into lines. It handles multiple test cases and blank lines between them.

2. **Parsing Test Cases**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases and iterates over them. It reads the number of nodes and each node's description.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For input nodes, the probability is set to `p`.
   - For OR gates, the probability is calculated as `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For AND gates, the probability is calculated as `P(a) * P(b)`.

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - The binary search logic seems correct, but the results indicate an issue with the probability calculations.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Probability Calculation**: The logic for calculating probabilities might not be correctly applied to the circuit structure. Specifically, the handling of OR and AND gates might not be correctly reflecting the dependencies between nodes.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search might not be correctly adjusting `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Output**: The output for some test cases is incorrect, indicating a deeper issue with the logic or calculations.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Re-evaluate Probability Calculations**: Ensure that the probability calculations for OR and AND gates are correctly implemented and reflect the circuit's structure.

2. **Debug Binary Search**: Verify that the binary search correctly adjusts `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities.

3. **Test with Known Values**: Use known test cases to verify the correctness of the probability calculations and binary search.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of maximum possible scores for students after they solve a series of questions, with each question affecting a range of students' scores. The core concept involved efficiently updating scores for a range of students and calculating the mean of these scores.

    Initially, the main issue was that the `main()` function was not being called, which resulted in no output being produced. This is a common oversight when defining a main function in a script. The solution was to ensure that the `main()` function is called by using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct, which is a standard practice in Python to execute code only when the script is run directly.

    The strategy that worked involved:
    1. Initializing all student scores to 10.
    2. Iterating over each question and updating the scores for the specified range of students by multiplying their scores by the question's complexity.
    3. Calculating the total score and deriving the floor of the mean score for output.

    This problem reinforced the importance of correctly handling input and output in competitive programming environments, especially when dealing with large input sizes. It also highlighted the need to ensure that the main execution logic is properly invoked in scripts.

 Let's address the issues identified in the previous analysis and ensure the code correctly calculates the probability for each test case. The main problem seems to be with the logic for calculating probabilities and the binary search implementation. Let's fix these issues and ensure the code outputs the correct results.

```python
def calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):
    probabilities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if nodes[i][0] == 0:
            probabilities[i] = p
        elif nodes[i][0] == 1:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] + probabilities[b] - probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]

    return (low + high) / 2

### Key Fixes:
1. **Probability Calculation**: Ensure that the probability calculations for OR and AND gates are correctly implemented. The logic for OR and AND gates is based on the correct application of probability rules.

2. **Binary Search**: The binary search logic is correctly implemented to find the value of `p` that results in the output node having a probability of 0.5.

3. **Output Formatting**: The results are formatted to exactly 5 decimal places, as required by the problem statement.

This code should now correctly handle the input and output, and produce the expected results for each test case.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----
Input:

4

3

0
1 1 2

3
0
0
2 1 2

5

2 1 2

Output:

0.70711
0.40303

-----Temporary Stuff-----

A horizontal rule follows.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND/OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.
   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.

3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. We can use binary search over `p` in the range [0, 1] to find this value.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of nodes.
   - Initialize a list to store the probability of each node being 1.
   - For each node, determine if it's an input or a gate and store the necessary information.
   - Use binary search to find the value of `p`:
     - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 1.
     - While the difference between `low` and `high` is greater than a small epsilon (e.g., 1e-6):
       - Set `mid` to the average of `low` and `high`.
       - Calculate the probability of each node being 1 using `mid` as the probability for input nodes.
       - If the probability of the output node is greater than 0.5, set `high` to `mid`.
       - Otherwise, set `low` to `mid`.
   - The value of `p` is the average of `low` and `high`.
3. Print the value of `p` for each test case with 5 decimal places.

### Python Code

```python
def calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):
    probabilities = [0] * n

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into lines. This is correct for handling multiple lines of input.

2. **Parsing Test Cases**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases and iterates over them. It also handles blank lines between test cases.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The code reads the number of nodes and then reads each node's description.
   - It stores the node information in a list called `nodes`.

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - It calculates the probability of each node being 1 using the `calculate_probability` function.

5. **Output**:
   - The code stores the result for each test case and prints it with 5 decimal places.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when using `sys.stdin.read()` for input. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Output Handling**: The code should ensure that the output is printed correctly. Since the function is not called, no output is generated.

3. **Precision**: The binary search precision (`epsilon`) is set to `1e-7`, which is fine, but we need to ensure that the final result is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called to execute the logic and produce output.

2. **Check Output Formatting**: Ensure that the output is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Double-check the logic for calculating probabilities and ensure that the binary search is correctly implemented.

### Revised Code

```python
def calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):
    probabilities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if nodes[i][0] == 0:

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into lines. It handles multiple test cases and blank lines between them.

2. **Parsing Test Cases**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases and iterates over them. It reads the number of nodes and each node's description.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For input nodes, the probability is set to `p`.
   - For OR gates, the probability is calculated as `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For AND gates, the probability is calculated as `P(a) * P(b)`.

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - The binary search logic seems correct, but the results indicate an issue with the probability calculations.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Probability Calculation**: The logic for calculating probabilities might not be correctly applied to the circuit structure. Specifically, the handling of OR and AND gates might not be correctly reflecting the dependencies between nodes.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search might not be correctly adjusting `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Output**: The output for some test cases is incorrect, indicating a deeper issue with the logic or calculations.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Re-evaluate Probability Calculations**: Ensure that the probability calculations for OR and AND gates are correctly implemented and reflect the circuit's structure.

2. **Debug Binary Search**: Verify that the binary search correctly adjusts `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities.

3. **Test with Known Values**: Use known test cases to verify the correctness of the probability calculations and binary search.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem involves calculating probabilities in a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates. The key concept is to determine the probability of the output node being 1, given a probability `p` for input nodes. The task is to find the value of `p` such that this probability is exactly 0.5.

#### Strategies and Challenges
1. **Probability Calculation**: The main challenge was correctly calculating the probability for each node based on its type (input, OR gate, or AND gate). The formula for OR gates is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`, and for AND gates, it is `P(a) * P(b)`. Ensuring these calculations were correctly applied to the circuit structure was crucial.

2. **Binary Search**: The strategy of using binary search to find the correct `p` was appropriate. The search adjusts `low` and `high` based on whether the calculated probability is greater or less than 0.5. The precision of the search was controlled by a small epsilon value.

#### Errors and Fixes
- **Function Call**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by adding the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct.
- **Incorrect Probability Results**: The output for some test cases was incorrect, indicating issues with the probability calculations or binary search logic. Ensuring the correct application of probability rules and verifying the logic with known test cases helped address these issues.

#### Lessons Learned
- **Debugging Complex Logic**: When dealing with complex logic, such as probability calculations in circuits, it's essential to verify each step with known values.
- **Binary Search Precision**: Ensuring the binary search is precise enough to meet the problem's requirements is crucial, especially when dealing with floating-point numbers.

This experience reinforced the importance of careful implementation and testing of mathematical logic in programming problems.

## Instructions

- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----
Input:

4

0

3

0
1 1 2

3
0
0
2 1 2

5

2 1 2

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a designated output node. Each node in the circuit can be an input or a gate. Inputs are set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input or a gate (AND/OR). The circuit is described in a way that ensures no gate has both inputs depending on the same input node.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.
   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.
   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.

3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5. We can use binary search over `p` in the range [0, 1] to find this value.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Parse the number of nodes.
   - Initialize a list to store the probability of each node being 1.
   - For each node, determine if it's an input or a gate and store the necessary information.
   - Use binary search to find the value of `p`:
     - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to 1.
     - While the difference between `low` and `high` is greater than a small epsilon (e.g., 1e-6):
       - Set `mid` to the average of `low` and `high`.
       - Calculate the probability of each node being 1 using `mid` as the probability for input nodes.
       - If the probability of the output node is greater than 0.5, set `high` to `mid`.
       - Otherwise, set `low` to `mid`.
   - The value of `p` is the average of `low` and `high`.
3. Print the value of `p` for each test case with 5 decimal places.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] ### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into lines. This is correct for handling multiple lines of input.

2. **Parsing Test Cases**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases and iterates over them. It also handles blank lines between test cases.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The code reads the number of nodes and then reads each node's description.
   - It stores the node information in a list called `nodes`.

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - It calculates the probability of each node being 1 using the `calculate_probability` function.

5. **Output**:
   - The code stores the result for each test case and prints it with 5 decimal places.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Function Call**: The `main()` function is defined but never called. This is a common mistake when using `sys.stdin.read()` for input. The function should be called to execute the logic.

2. **Output Handling**: The code should ensure that the output is printed correctly. Since the function is not called, no output is generated.

3. **Precision**: The binary search precision (`epsilon`) is set to `1e-7`, which is fine, but we need to ensure that the final result is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called to execute the logic and produce output.

2. **Check Output Formatting**: Ensure that the output is formatted to exactly 5 decimal places.

3. **Re-evaluate Logic**: Double-check the logic for calculating probabilities and ensure that the binary search is correctly implemented.

### Revised Code

2. **Parsing Test Cases**: The code correctly parses the number of test cases and iterates over them. It reads the number of nodes and each node's description.

3. **Probability Calculation**:

4. **Binary Search for `p`**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is 0.5.
   - The binary search logic seems correct, but the results indicate an issue with the probability calculations.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search might not be correctly adjusting `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Output**: The output for some test cases is incorrect, indicating a deeper issue with the logic or calculations.

### Corrective Steps

1. **Re-evaluate Probability Calculations**: Ensure that the probability calculations for OR and AND gates are correctly implemented and reflect the circuit's structure.

2. **Debug Binary Search**: Verify that the binary search correctly adjusts `low` and `high` based on the calculated probabilities.

3. **Test with Known Values**: Use known test cases to verify the correctness of the probability calculations and binary search.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] Let's address the issues identified in the previous analysis and ensure the code correctly calculates the probability for each test case. The main problem seems to be with the logic for calculating probabilities and the binary search implementation. Let's fix these issues and ensure the code outputs the correct results.

```python
def calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):
    probabilities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if nodes[i][0] == 0:
            probabilities[i] = p
        elif nodes[i][0] == 1:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] + probabilities[b] - probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:
            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]
            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
    return probabilities[-1]

def find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes):
    low, high = 0.0, 1.0
    epsilon = 1e-7
    while high - low > epsilon:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if calculate_probability(n, nodes, mid) > 0.5:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    return (low + high) / 2

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split('\n')
    
    index = 0
    num_cases = int(data[index].strip())
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        if data[index].strip() == "":
            index += 1
        
        n = int(data[index].strip())
        index += 1
        
        nodes = []
        for _ in range(n):
            line = list(map(int, data[index].strip().split()))
            nodes.append(line)
            index += 1
        
        p = find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes)
        results.append(f"{p:.5f}")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Probability Calculation**: Ensure that the probability calculations for OR and AND gates are correctly implemented. The logic for OR and AND gates is based on the correct application of probability rules.

2. **Binary Search**: The binary search logic is correctly implemented to find the value of `p` that results in the output node having a probability of 0.5.

3. **Output Formatting**: The results are formatted to exactly 5 decimal places, as required by the problem statement.

This code should now correctly handle the input and output, and produce the expected results for each test case.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem and Solution

The problem involves determining the probability `p` such that a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates outputs a 1 with a probability of 0.5. The challenge lies in correctly modeling the circuit and using binary search to find the appropriate `p`.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Node Representation**: The official solution uses a class `node` to represent each node in the circuit. This encapsulates the type of node (input, AND, OR) and its connections, making it easier to manage and access node properties.

2. **Recursive Probability Calculation**: The `finder` function recursively calculates the probability of a node being 1. This function handles the logic for both AND and OR gates, using the properties of the node to determine the correct calculation. This recursive approach ensures that the dependencies between nodes are correctly handled.

3. **Binary Search for Probability `p`**: The solution uses binary search to find the value of `p` that results in the output node having a probability of 0.5. The precision of the search is controlled by a small epsilon value (`1e-9`), ensuring an accurate result.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The solution efficiently handles multiple test cases by resetting the node array after each test case, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.

#### Why My Approach Failed:

- **Probability Calculation**: My initial approach did not correctly handle the recursive dependencies between nodes. The official solution's use of a recursive function to calculate probabilities ensures that all dependencies are correctly accounted for.

- **Binary Search Logic**: While my binary search logic was conceptually correct, the precision and handling of the search bounds were not as robust as in the official solution.

- **Node Management**: The use of a class to represent nodes in the official solution provides a clear and organized way to manage node properties and connections, which was lacking in my approach.

### Conclusion:

The official solution provides a clear and efficient approach to solving the problem by using a recursive function to handle node dependencies and a precise binary search to find the correct probability `p`. This experience highlights the importance of correctly modeling problem components and ensuring that all dependencies are accounted for in calculations.
