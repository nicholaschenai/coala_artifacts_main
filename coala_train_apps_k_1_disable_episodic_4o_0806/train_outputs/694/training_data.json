    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of times all three groups of students (first, second, and third-year) are present on campus simultaneously over a given number of days. The key insight was recognizing that this simultaneous presence occurs at intervals defined by the least common multiple (LCM) of their respective visit intervals.\n\nThe solution involved calculating the LCM of three numbers, which required understanding and implementing the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). This was used to compute the LCM efficiently. The main challenge was ensuring that the LCM calculation was correct and that it was applied over the total hours in `N` days (i.e., `N * 24` hours).\n\nThe strategy of breaking down the problem into smaller functions\u2014`gcd`, `lcm`, and `lcm_of_three`\u2014proved effective. This modular approach made the code easier to understand and debug. The solution was implemented in a way that efficiently handled multiple test cases by reading input in bulk and processing each case iteratively.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving scheduling and interval-related problems. The solution was straightforward once the correct approach was identified, and it passed all test cases successfully.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, the task was to determine how many times all three groups of students (first-year, second-year, and third-year) are present on campus simultaneously over a given number of days. The key to solving this problem was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which each group arrives.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **LCM Calculation**: Both my solution and the official solution use the concept of LCM to determine the interval at which all groups are present simultaneously. The LCM of three numbers can be calculated by first finding the LCM of two numbers and then using that result to find the LCM with the third number.\n\n2. **GCD Function**: The official solution uses a custom GCD function to calculate the LCM, which is similar to the approach I used. The GCD is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\n3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: Both solutions handle multiple test cases by iterating over the input and applying the LCM calculation for each set of inputs.\n\n4. **Conversion to Hours**: Both solutions correctly convert the number of days into hours (`N * 24`) to determine the total time span over which the LCM should be applied.\n\n### Reflection:\n\n- The problem reinforced the importance of understanding and applying the concept of LCM in problems involving periodic events.\n- The official solution is similar to mine in terms of logic and efficiency, which indicates that my approach was on the right track.\n- The use of a custom GCD function in the official solution is a good reminder of how foundational algorithms like GCD can be implemented manually when needed, although Python's `math` library provides built-in functions for these operations.\n\nOverall, this problem was a good exercise in applying mathematical concepts to solve real-world scheduling problems.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and for each test case, the number of days and three integer values. It calculates the number of times a specific event, occurring at intervals determined by the least common multiple of the three integers, can happen within the total hours of the given days. The results for each test case are stored in a list and then printed out sequentially.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the frequency of overlapping events that occur at different intervals. For example, if you are organizing an event and want to know how often certain groups will be present simultaneously, this approach can help. It is also applicable in scheduling problems where multiple periodic tasks need to be synchronized, such as in computer science for task scheduling, or in operations research for optimizing resource allocation. Understanding how to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of multiple intervals is crucial in these scenarios, as it allows you to find the common occurrence time for all events."
