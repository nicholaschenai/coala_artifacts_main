First-year students come every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on the same day over `N` days.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the number of times all three groups of students are on campus together. This happens when the time is a common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\n2. **Use Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The key is to find the least common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`. This LCM will tell us the interval at which all three groups are on campus together.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this interval fits into the total hours over `N` days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total hours over `N` days is `24 * N`.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Test Cases**: We need to repeat the above steps for each test case provided.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction gcd(a, b):\n    while b is not 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\nfunction lcm(a, b):\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\nfunction lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\nfunction calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z):\n    total_hours = 24 * N\n    interval = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n    return total_hours // interval\n\nread T\nfor each test case:\n    read N\n    read x, y, z\n    result = calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z)\n    print result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\n# Helper function to calculate the greatest common divisor\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Helper function to calculate the least common multiple\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\n# Function to calculate the least common multiple of three numbers\ndef lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\n# Main function to calculate the number of times all students are present\ndef calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z):\n    total_hours = 24 * N\n    interval = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n    return total_hours // interval\n\n# Read number of test cases\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\n\n# Process each test case\nresults = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    x, y, z = map(int, data[index + 1:index + 4])\n    index += 4\n    result = calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z)\n    results.append(result)\n\n# Output results for each test case\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to calculate the number of times all students are present together, and outputs the result for each test case.

The core concept involved efficiently updating scores for a range of students and calculating the mean of these scores.\n\n    Initially, the main issue was that the `main()` function was not being called, which resulted in no output being produced. This is a common oversight when defining a main function in a script. The solution was to ensure that the `main()` function is called by using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct, which is a standard practice in Python to execute code only when the script is run directly.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved:\n    1. Initializing all student scores to 10.\n    2. Iterating over each question and updating the scores for the specified range of students by multiplying their scores by the question's complexity.\n    3. Calculating the total score and deriving the floor of the mean score for output.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of correctly handling input and output in competitive programming environments, especially when dealing with large input sizes. It also highlighted the need to ensure that the main execution logic is properly invoked in scripts.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The LCM of three numbers can be calculated by first finding the LCM of two numbers and then using that result to find the LCM with the third number.\n\n2. **GCD Function**: The official solution uses a custom GCD function to calculate the LCM, which is similar to the approach I used.

The results for each test case are stored in a list and then printed out sequentially.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the frequency of overlapping events that occur at different intervals. For example, if you are organizing an event and want to know how often certain groups will be present simultaneously, this approach can help. It is also applicable in scheduling problems where multiple periodic tasks need to be synchronized, such as in computer science for task scheduling, or in operations research for optimizing resource allocation. Understanding how to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of multiple intervals is crucial in these scenarios, as it allows you to find the common occurrence time for all events."
