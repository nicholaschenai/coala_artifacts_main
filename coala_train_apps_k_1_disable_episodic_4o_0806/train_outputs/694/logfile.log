INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine how many times all first-year, second-year, and third-year students are present on campus together over a period of `N` days. First-year students come every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on the same day over `N` days.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the number of times all three groups of students are on campus together. This happens when the time is a common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Use Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The key is to find the least common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`. This LCM will tell us the interval at which all three groups are on campus together.

3. **Calculate the Number of Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this interval fits into the total hours over `N` days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total hours over `N` days is `24 * N`.

4. **Iterate Over Test Cases**: We need to repeat the above steps for each test case provided.

## Pseudocode

```
function gcd(a, b):
    while b is not 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

function lcm(a, b):
    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

function lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

function calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z):
    total_hours = 24 * N
    interval = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
    return total_hours // interval

read T
for each test case:
    read N
    read x, y, z
    result = calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z)
    print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
# Helper function to calculate the greatest common divisor
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Helper function to calculate the least common multiple
def lcm(a, b):
    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

# Function to calculate the least common multiple of three numbers
def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

# Main function to calculate the number of times all students are present
def calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z):
    total_hours = 24 * N
    interval = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
    return total_hours // interval

# Read number of test cases
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1

# Process each test case
results = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    x, y, z = map(int, data[index + 1:index + 4])
    index += 4
    result = calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z)
    results.append(result)

# Output results for each test case
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to calculate the number of times all students are present together, and outputs the result for each test case. The use of LCM ensures that we correctly determine the intervals at which all groups are present simultaneously.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of maximum possible scores for students after they solve a series of questions, with each question affecting a range of students' scores. The core concept involved efficiently updating scores for a range of students and calculating the mean of these scores.

    Initially, the main issue was that the `main()` function was not being called, which resulted in no output being produced. This is a common oversight when defining a main function in a script. The solution was to ensure that the `main()` function is called by using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct, which is a standard practice in Python to execute code only when the script is run directly.

    The strategy that worked involved:
    1. Initializing all student scores to 10.
    2. Iterating over each question and updating the scores for the specified range of students by multiplying their scores by the question's complexity.
    3. Calculating the total score and deriving the floor of the mean score for output.

    This problem reinforced the importance of correctly handling input and output in competitive programming environments, especially when dealing with large input sizes. It also highlighted the need to ensure that the main execution logic is properly invoked in scripts.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of times all three groups of students (first, second, and third-year) are present on campus simultaneously over a given number of days. The key insight was recognizing that this simultaneous presence occurs at intervals defined by the least common multiple (LCM) of their respective visit intervals.

The solution involved calculating the LCM of three numbers, which required understanding and implementing the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). This was used to compute the LCM efficiently. The main challenge was ensuring that the LCM calculation was correct and that it was applied over the total hours in `N` days (i.e., `N * 24` hours).

The strategy of breaking down the problem into smaller functions—`gcd`, `lcm`, and `lcm_of_three`—proved effective. This modular approach made the code easier to understand and debug. The solution was implemented in a way that efficiently handled multiple test cases by reading input in bulk and processing each case iteratively.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving scheduling and interval-related problems. The solution was straightforward once the correct approach was identified, and it passed all test cases successfully.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The MarkiT online virtual market startup wants to organize its grand opening in NIT Patna.
but they want maximum crowd for their inauguration. So the manager told  this  to Praveen a student in NITP who suggested them:
The first-year students come to campus  every x hour,
Second-year students come to campus every y hour,
Third-year students come to campus every z hour and 
Fourth-year is very busy so they don't come regularly.
So Praveen being very clever told him the no of times in n days he can have an audience of all year student (1st,2nd & 3rd) at max. So can you code what Praveen has done?

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a 2 line of input, first line contain one  integers $N$ (No of Days). 
-Next line contain 3 space separated integer the  value of x y z

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer the no of times audience consists of all year.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^8$
- $1 \leq x,y,z \leq 10^5$

INFO - [Task id] 694 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine how many times all first, second, and third-year students are present on campus simultaneously over a given number of days. Each group of students comes to campus at regular intervals: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on the same day over `N` days.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the number of times all three groups of students are on campus at the same time over `N` days. This happens when the time is a common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Use Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The key is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The LCM will give us the interval at which all three groups are present simultaneously.

3. **Calculate the Number of Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this interval fits into the total hours over `N` days (i.e., `N * 24` hours).

4. **Iterate for Each Test Case**: We need to repeat the above steps for each test case provided.

## Pseudocode

```
function gcd(a, b):
    while b is not zero:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

function lcm(a, b):
    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

function lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

function calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z):
    total_hours = N * 24
    interval = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
    return total_hours // interval

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read x, y, z
        result = calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z)
        print result
```

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine how many times all three groups of students (first-year, second-year, and third-year) are present on campus simultaneously over a given number of days. The key to solving this problem was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which each group arrives.

### Key Insights:

1. **LCM Calculation**: Both my solution and the official solution use the concept of LCM to determine the interval at which all groups are present simultaneously. The LCM of three numbers can be calculated by first finding the LCM of two numbers and then using that result to find the LCM with the third number.

2. **GCD Function**: The official solution uses a custom GCD function to calculate the LCM, which is similar to the approach I used. The GCD is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient and straightforward.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: Both solutions handle multiple test cases by iterating over the input and applying the LCM calculation for each set of inputs.

4. **Conversion to Hours**: Both solutions correctly convert the number of days into hours (`N * 24`) to determine the total time span over which the LCM should be applied.

### Reflection:

- The problem reinforced the importance of understanding and applying the concept of LCM in problems involving periodic events.
- The official solution is similar to mine in terms of logic and efficiency, which indicates that my approach was on the right track.
- The use of a custom GCD function in the official solution is a good reminder of how foundational algorithms like GCD can be implemented manually when needed, although Python's `math` library provides built-in functions for these operations.

Overall, this problem was a good exercise in applying mathematical concepts to solve real-world scheduling problems.
