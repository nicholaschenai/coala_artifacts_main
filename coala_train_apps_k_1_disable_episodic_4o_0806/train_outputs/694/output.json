    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine how many times all first, second, and third-year students are present on campus simultaneously over a given number of days. Each group of students comes to campus at regular intervals: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on the same day over `N` days.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the number of times all three groups of students are on campus at the same time over `N` days. This happens when the time is a common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\n2. **Use Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The key is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The LCM will give us the interval at which all three groups are present simultaneously.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this interval fits into the total hours over `N` days (i.e., `N * 24` hours).\n\n4. **Iterate for Each Test Case**: We need to repeat the above steps for each test case provided.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction gcd(a, b):\n    while b is not zero:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\nfunction lcm(a, b):\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\nfunction lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\nfunction calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z):\n    total_hours = N * 24\n    interval = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n    return total_hours // interval\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read N\n        read x, y, z\n        result = calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z)\n        print result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    # Calculate the greatest common divisor using Euclid's algorithm\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    # Calculate the least common multiple using the gcd\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\ndef lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n    # Calculate the lcm of three numbers\n    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\ndef calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z):\n    # Total hours in N days\n    total_hours = N * 24\n    # Find the interval at which all groups are present\n    interval = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n    # Calculate how many times this interval fits into the total hours\n    return total_hours // interval\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        x = int(data[index + 1])\n        y = int(data[index + 2])\n        z = int(data[index + 3])\n        index += 4\n        \n        result = calculate_occurrences(N, x, y, z)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# The main function will be called when the script is executed\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, calculates the number of times all student groups are present simultaneously using the LCM of their intervals, and outputs the result for each test case.",
