These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.\nInitially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),\u2026,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \\ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.\nSince you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,\u2026,K$1, 2, \\ldots, K$ seconds.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases.

Ryan starts in city 1 and can move to adjacent cities or stay in the same city over a series of seconds. We need to determine how many different sequences of city visits Ryan can make over a given number of seconds, while satisfying certain conditions that specify which city he must be in at specific seconds. The result should be computed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. This involves:\n   - Initializing a DP table where `dp[t][c]` represents the number of ways to be in city `c` at time `t`.\n   - Start with `dp[0][1] = 1` since Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.\n\n3. **Transition**: For each second, update the DP table based on the current city and its adjacent cities:\n   - For each city `c` at time `t`, distribute the number of ways to all its adjacent cities at time `t+1`.\n\n4. **Apply Conditions**: For each condition `(a_i, b_i)`, ensure that the number of ways to be in city `a_i` at time `b_i` is non-zero. If any condition cannot be satisfied, the result is 0 for that test case.\n\n5. **Result Calculation**: After processing all seconds, the result is the sum of all possible ways to be in any city at the final second `K`, modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction countTrips(T, test_cases):\n    MOD = 10^9 + 7\n    results = []\n    \n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, M, K = test_case['N'], test_case['M'], test_case['K']\n        roads = test_case['roads']\n        Q = test_case['Q']\n        conditions = test_case['conditions']\n        \n        # Initialize adjacency list for the graph\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(N+1)]\n        for u, v in roads:\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        # Initialize DP table\n        dp = [[0] * (N+1) for _ in range(K+1)]\n        dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n        \n        # Fill DP table\n        for t in range(K):\n            for c in range(1, N+1):\n                if dp[t][c] > 0:\n                    # Move to adjacent cities or stay\n                    for neighbor in graph[c]:\n                        dp[t+1][neighbor] = (dp[t+1][neighbor] + dp[t][c]) % MOD\n                    dp[t+1][c] = (dp[t+1][c] + dp[t][c]) % MOD\n        \n        # Check conditions\n        valid = True\n        for a, b in conditions:\n            if dp[b][a] == 0:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        \n        # Calculate result\n        if valid:\n            result = sum(dp[K]) % MOD\n        else:\n            result = 0\n        \n        results.append(result)\n    \n    return results\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef countTrips(T, test_cases):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    results = []\n    \n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, M, K = test_case['N'], test_case['M'], test_case['K']\n        roads = test_case['roads']\n        Q = test_case['Q']\n        conditions = test_case['conditions']\n        \n        # Initialize adjacency list for the graph\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(N+1)]\n        for u, v in roads:\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        # Initialize DP table\n        dp = [[0] * (N+1) for _ in range(K+1)]\n        dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n        \n        # Fill DP table\n        for t in range(K):\n            for c in range(1, N+1):\n                if dp[t][c] > 0:\n                    # Move to adjacent cities or stay\n                    for neighbor in graph[c]:\n                        dp[t+1][neighbor] = (dp[t+1][neighbor] + dp[t][c]) % MOD\n                    dp[t+1][c] = (dp[t+1][c] + dp[t][c]) % MOD\n        \n        # Check conditions\n        valid = True\n        for a, b in conditions:\n            if dp[b][a] == 0:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        \n        # Calculate result\n        if valid:\n            result = sum(dp[K]) % MOD\n        else:\n            result = 0\n        \n        results.append(result)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = number of test cases\n# test_cases = list of test case dictionaries with keys 'N', 'M', 'K', 'roads', 'Q', 'conditions'\n# print(countTrips(T, test_cases))\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the number of valid trips Ryan can make, considering the constraints and conditions provided."

This involves calculating combinations to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers and using powers of 2 to account for the remaining numbers.\n\n    2. **Efficiency in Computation**: My solution precomputes factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations using the formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\). This approach is efficient for large values of `N` and `K`, as it avoids recalculating factorials for each query. The official solution, however, uses a more direct approach with loops to calculate combinations, which might be less efficient for larger inputs but is straightforward and avoids the need for precomputation.\n\n    3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly handle large numbers by using modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.\n\n    4. **Function Execution**: A key issue in my initial attempts was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output being produced. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed, especially when using functions to encapsulate the solution.\n\n    5. **Input/Output Handling**: The official solution uses `input()` and `print()` for handling input and output, which is straightforward and works well for competitive programming environments. My solution used `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write`, which are efficient for handling large input and output but require careful management of data parsing and function execution.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations, careful handling of input/output, and ensuring that the main logic is executed. The official solution provides a simpler, albeit potentially less efficient, approach to the problem, which can be useful in scenarios where precomputation is not feasible or necessary.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This is a common approach for competitive programming, but we need to ensure that the index is correctly managed throughout the input parsing.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list, which is correct. Each city is connected to its neighbors, and this is used to determine possible moves.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The DP table is initialized with zeros, and `dp[0][1]` is set to 1, which is correct since Ryan starts at city 1 at time 0.\n\n4. **DP Table Update**: The DP table is updated for each second `t` and each city `c`. The code correctly updates the number of ways to reach each city by considering both staying in the current city and moving to adjacent cities.\n\n5. **Condition Checking**: The code checks if the conditions are met by verifying that `dp[b_i][a_i] > 0` for each condition `(a_i, b_i)`. If any condition is not met, it sets the result to 0.\n\n6. **Output**: The results are collected in a list and printed at the end. However, the function `solve()` is not called, which is why no output is produced.\n\n### Where the Code Went Wrong\n\n- **Function Call**: The main issue is that the `solve()` function is defined but never called.

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The problem tests the ability to manage state transitions based on conditions and constraints, which is a common pattern in dynamic programming problems.\n\n    The successful strategy involved using a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. The key was to iterate over the indices in the order of increasing values, which ensures that when calculating `dp[i]`, all potential destination indices have already been processed. This ordering is crucial because it allows us to build the solution incrementally and ensures that the `dp` values are accurate when used to update other indices.\n\n    One potential pitfall was ensuring that jumps only occur when the conditions are met (i.e., the starting index value is greater than the destination index value and all intermediate values). This was handled by breaking out of the loop when a jump was not possible, which prevents unnecessary calculations and maintains the integrity of the `dp` values.\n\n    Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of ordering and state management in dynamic programming, especially when dealing with constraints that affect transitions between states. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The current solution checks if `dp[b_i][a_i] > 0` to determine if the condition is met, but it doesn't correctly account for the number of ways to satisfy all conditions simultaneously.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is calculated as the product of `dp[b_i][a_i]` for each condition, but this approach is incorrect because it doesn't consider the paths that satisfy all conditions together.\n\n### Where the Code Went Wrong\n\n- **Condition Satisfaction**: The current approach checks each condition independently, but it should ensure that all conditions are satisfied in a single trip. The DP table should be updated in a way that considers all conditions simultaneously.\n\n- **Result Calculation**: The result should be the number of valid trips that satisfy all conditions, not the product of independent condition satisfactions.\n\n### Correcting the Mistake\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the DP table is updated in a way that considers all conditions together. We should also ensure that the result calculation correctly reflects the number of valid trips.\n\nHere's the corrected approach:\n\n1. **Update DP Table with Conditions**: As we update the DP table, we should check if the current time matches any condition time. If it does, ensure that the current city matches the required city for that condition.\n\n2. **Result Calculation**: After filling the DP table, the result should be the number of ways to satisfy all conditions, which is the value in the DP table at the last second for the last condition city.\n\nLet's update the code accordingly:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        M = int(data[index + 1])\n        K = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n        \n        for _ in range(M):\n            u = int(data[index])\n            v = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        Q = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        \n        conditions = []\n        for _ in range(Q):\n            a_i = int(data[index])\n            b_i = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            conditions.append((a_i, b_i))\n        \n        # Initialize DP table\n        dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]\n        dp[0][1] = 1  # start at city 1 at time 0\n        \n        # Fill DP table\n        for t in range(1, K + 1):\n            for c in range(1, N + 1):\n                for n in graph[c]:\n                    dp[t][n] = (dp[t][n] + dp[t - 1][c]) % MOD\n                dp[t][c] = (dp[t][c] + dp[t - 1][c]) % MOD  # stay in the same city\n            \n            # Apply conditions at each time step\n            for a_i, b_i in conditions:\n                if t == b_i:\n                    # Only keep the valid paths that end in the required city\n                    for c in range(1, N + 1):\n                        if c != a_i:\n                            dp[t][c] = 0\n        \n        # Result is the number of ways to satisfy all conditions\n        if conditions:\n            result = dp[K][conditions[-1][0]]\n        else:\n            result = sum(dp[K]) % MOD\n        \n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the solution\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Fixes:\n- **Condition Application**: At each time step, we check if it matches any condition time.

The problem tests the ability to manage state transitions based on conditions and constraints, which is a common pattern in dynamic programming problems.\n\n    The successful strategy involved using a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. The key was to iterate over the indices in the order of increasing values, which ensures that when calculating `dp[i]`, all potential destination indices have already been processed. This ordering is crucial because it allows us to build the solution incrementally and ensures that the `dp` values are accurate when used to update other indices.\n\n    One potential pitfall was ensuring that jumps only occur when the conditions are met (i.e., the starting index value is greater than the destination index value and all intermediate values). This was handled by breaking out of the loop when a jump was not possible, which prevents unnecessary calculations and maintains the integrity of the `dp` values.\n\n    Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of ordering and state management in dynamic programming, especially when dealing with constraints that affect transitions between states. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The core concept is using dynamic programming (DP) to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second, while ensuring that all conditions are satisfied simultaneously.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\nInitially, the strategy was to use a DP table where `dp[t][c]` represents the number of ways to be in city `c` at time `t`. The challenge was ensuring that all conditions `(a_i, b_i)` are satisfied in a single trip. The initial approach checked conditions independently, which led to incorrect results because it didn't ensure all conditions were met together.\n\n#### Fixes and Insights\nThe key fix was to apply conditions during the DP table update. At each time step, if it matched a condition time, paths not ending in the required city were zeroed out. This ensured that only valid paths satisfying all conditions were considered. The result was then calculated from the DP table at the last second for the last condition city.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n- **Simultaneous Condition Satisfaction**: It's crucial to ensure that all conditions are satisfied together, not independently.\n- **DP Table Management**: Properly managing the DP table and applying conditions during updates can significantly affect the correctness of the solution.\n- **Debugging**: Carefully checking the logic for condition application and result calculation is essential, especially in complex DP problems.\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of understanding how to apply conditions in dynamic programming problems and ensuring that all constraints are considered in the solution."

The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the number of valid paths that satisfy all conditions simultaneously.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: The cities and roads are represented as an adjacency list, which is a common and efficient way to handle graph traversal problems.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming table `A` where `A[k][i]` represents the number of ways to be in city `i` at time `k`. This is similar to my approach, but the official solution uses a backward iteration to fill the DP table, which is a crucial difference.\n\n3. **Backward Iteration**: The official solution iterates backward from the last second to the first. This allows it to directly apply conditions at the exact time they are required, ensuring that only valid paths are considered. This approach is more intuitive for handling conditions that specify where Ryan must be at certain times.\n\n4. **Condition Application**: The conditions are applied by setting the DP table entries to zero for cities that do not match the required city at the specified time. This ensures that only paths satisfying all conditions are counted.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The backward iteration and direct application of conditions make the solution efficient, as it avoids recalculating paths that cannot satisfy the conditions.\n\n### Why My Approach Failed\n\n- **Forward Iteration**: My approach used forward iteration, which made it difficult to apply conditions effectively. This led to incorrect results because it didn't properly account for the requirement to be in specific cities at specific times.\n\n- **Condition Handling**: I attempted to zero out paths that didn't meet conditions, but the logic was flawed because it didn't ensure that all conditions were satisfied in a single trip.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe official solution's use of backward iteration and direct condition application is a more effective strategy for this problem. It ensures that the DP table accurately reflects the number of valid paths that satisfy all conditions, leading to correct results. This experience highlights the importance of considering both forward and backward approaches in dynamic programming problems, especially when specific conditions must be met at certain times."
