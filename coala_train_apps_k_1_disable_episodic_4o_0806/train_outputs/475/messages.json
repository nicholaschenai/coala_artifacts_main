This method is simple and works well for the given constraints, but it may not be the most efficient in terms of time complexity, especially for larger inputs.\n\n2. **Official Solution Insights**: The official solution employs a more sophisticated approach using prefix sums and binary search. This method is more efficient, particularly in handling larger arrays, as it avoids the need to explicitly generate and sort all subarray sums.\n\n3. **Prefix Sums**: The use of prefix sums (arrays `B` and `C`) allows for efficient calculation of subarray sums. This reduces the complexity of calculating sums for any subarray, as it can be done in constant time after the prefix sums are computed.\n\n4. **Binary Search and Two-Pointer Technique**: The official solution uses a binary search to efficiently find the k-th smallest subarray sum. The two-pointer technique is used to count how many subarray sums are less than or equal to a given score. This is a clever way to avoid sorting and directly find the required sums.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The official solution is more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It leverages mathematical insights and algorithmic techniques to reduce the problem's complexity, making it suitable for larger input sizes.\n\nIn summary, while my initial solution was correct and passed the test cases, the official solution provides a more efficient and scalable approach. It highlights the importance of using advanced techniques like prefix sums, binary search, and two-pointer methods to optimize performance in algorithmic problems. This experience reinforces the value of exploring different algorithmic strategies and understanding their trade-offs in terms of complexity and efficiency."
