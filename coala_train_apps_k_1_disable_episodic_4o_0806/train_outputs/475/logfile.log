## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        
```

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of positive integers. We need to calculate the sum of all possible non-empty continuous subarrays, sort these sums, and then find the sum of a specific range of these sorted sums. The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, generate all possible non-empty continuous subarrays from the given array.
   - Calculate the sum for each of these subarrays.
   - Store all these sums in a list.
   - Sort the list of sums in non-decreasing order.
   - Calculate the sum of the elements in this sorted list from the `left` index to the `right` index (1-based index).
   - Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize an empty list `subarray_sums`
   For each starting index `i` from 0 to n-1:
       Initialize `current_sum` to 0
       For each ending index `j` from `i` to n-1:
           Add `nums[j]` to `current_sum`
           Append `current_sum` to `subarray_sums`
   Sort `subarray_sums`
   Calculate the sum of elements from index `left-1` to `right-1` in `subarray_sums`
   Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # Initialize an empty list to store the sums of subarrays
        subarray_sums = []
        
        # Generate all possible subarrays
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                # Calculate the sum of the subarray from i to j
                current_sum += nums[j]
                # Append the sum to the list
                subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
        
        # Sort the list of subarray sums
        subarray_sums.sort()
        
        # Calculate the sum of the elements from index left-1 to right-1
        result = sum(subarray_sums[left-1:right])
        
        # Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7
        return result % (10**9 + 7)
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and efficiently calculates the required sum of subarray sums within the specified range.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The core concept here was recognizing that the multiples of 10 form an arithmetic sequence, which allowed us to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to efficiently compute the result.

    Key steps included:
    - Identifying the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to "N".
    - Calculating the number of such multiples.
    - Using the arithmetic series sum formula: \( \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{number of terms} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})}{2} \).

    The solution was implemented in Python, reading input from standard input and outputting results for each test case. The approach was efficient, leveraging integer division and arithmetic properties to handle large values of "N" up to 1 billion without performance issues.

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sequences and using mathematical formulas to simplify calculations, especially when dealing with large input sizes.

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array of positive integers, `nums`, and we need to compute the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays. These sums are then sorted in non-decreasing order to form a new array. We need to return the sum of the elements from index `left` to `right` (1-based index) in this sorted array, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Generate Subarray Sums**: For each possible subarray in `nums`, calculate its sum. This involves iterating over all possible starting points and for each starting point, iterating over all possible ending points to compute the sum.

2. **Sort the Sums**: Once all subarray sums are computed, sort them in non-decreasing order.

3. **Calculate the Required Sum**: Sum the elements from index `left` to `right` in the sorted list of sums. Since the indices are 1-based, adjust them to 0-based for Python list indexing.

4. **Return the Result Modulo \(10^9 + 7\)**: Since the result can be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

    for k from left-1 to right-1:
        result += subarray_sums[k]
    
    return result modulo (10^9 + 7)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Generate all subarray sums
        subarray_sums = []

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to compute all possible subarray sums from a given list of integers, sort these sums, and then calculate the sum of a specified range of these sorted sums. The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.

The strategy that worked involved a straightforward approach:
1. **Subarray Sum Calculation**: Iterate over all possible starting points of subarrays and compute the sum for each possible ending point. This results in a list of all subarray sums.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the list of subarray sums to facilitate easy range sum calculation.
3. **Range Sum Calculation**: Sum the elements from the specified range in the sorted list, adjusting for 1-based indexing.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The solution was implemented efficiently using nested loops for subarray sum calculation and Python's built-in sort function. The modulo operation ensured that the result remained within the required bounds. This approach passed all test cases without any unexpected errors, demonstrating its correctness and efficiency for the given constraints.

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        
```

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 475 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array of positive integers, `nums`, and we need to compute the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays. These sums are then sorted in non-decreasing order to form a new array. We need to return the sum of the elements from index `left` to `right` (1-based index) in this sorted array, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Generate Subarray Sums**: For each possible subarray in `nums`, calculate its sum. This involves iterating over all possible starting points and for each starting point, iterating over all possible ending points to compute the sum.

2. **Sort the Sums**: Once all subarray sums are computed, sort them in non-decreasing order.

3. **Calculate the Required Sum**: Sum the elements from index `left` to `right` in the sorted list of sums. Since the indices are 1-based, adjust them to 0-based for Python list indexing.

4. **Return the Result Modulo \(10^9 + 7\)**: Since the result can be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Pseudocode

```
function rangeSum(nums, n, left, right):
    subarray_sums = []
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        current_sum = 0
        for j from i to n-1:
            current_sum += nums[j]
            append current_sum to subarray_sums
    
    sort subarray_sums
    
    result = 0
    for k from left-1 to right-1:
        result += subarray_sums[k]
    
    return result modulo (10^9 + 7)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Generate all subarray sums
        subarray_sums = []
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                current_sum += nums[j]
                subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
        
        # Step 2: Sort the subarray sums
        subarray_sums.sort()
        
        # Step 3: Calculate the sum from index left to right (1-based index)
        result = 0
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        for k in range(left - 1, right):
            result += subarray_sums[k]
        
        # Step 4: Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7
        return result % MOD
```

This solution efficiently computes all subarray sums, sorts them, and calculates the required sum within the specified range, ensuring the result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, there are several insights and comparisons to be made:

1. **Initial Approach**: My initial approach was straightforward, focusing on generating all possible subarray sums, sorting them, and then summing the required range. This method is simple and works well for the given constraints, but it may not be the most efficient in terms of time complexity, especially for larger inputs.

2. **Official Solution Insights**: The official solution employs a more sophisticated approach using prefix sums and binary search. This method is more efficient, particularly in handling larger arrays, as it avoids the need to explicitly generate and sort all subarray sums.

3. **Prefix Sums**: The use of prefix sums (arrays `B` and `C`) allows for efficient calculation of subarray sums. This reduces the complexity of calculating sums for any subarray, as it can be done in constant time after the prefix sums are computed.

4. **Binary Search and Two-Pointer Technique**: The official solution uses a binary search to efficiently find the k-th smallest subarray sum. The two-pointer technique is used to count how many subarray sums are less than or equal to a given score. This is a clever way to avoid sorting and directly find the required sums.

5. **Efficiency**: The official solution is more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It leverages mathematical insights and algorithmic techniques to reduce the problem's complexity, making it suitable for larger input sizes.

In summary, while my initial solution was correct and passed the test cases, the official solution provides a more efficient and scalable approach. It highlights the importance of using advanced techniques like prefix sums, binary search, and two-pointer methods to optimize performance in algorithmic problems. This experience reinforces the value of exploring different algorithmic strategies and understanding their trade-offs in terms of complexity and efficiency.
