    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given an encoded string that follows a specific pattern: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a string that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns into their repeated forms. The input string is guaranteed to be valid, with well-formed brackets and no extraneous spaces.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo decode the string, we need to process it character by character, handling numbers, letters, and brackets appropriately. We can use a stack to help manage nested patterns:\n\n1. **Stack Usage**: Use a stack to keep track of the current string being built and the repeat count for nested patterns.\n2. **Iterate Through String**: Traverse the string character by character.\n   - If a digit is encountered, determine the full number (as it may be more than one digit).\n   - If an opening bracket `[` is encountered, push the current string and repeat count onto the stack and reset them for the new pattern.\n   - If a closing bracket `]` is encountered, pop from the stack to get the last string and repeat count, then append the current string repeated `k` times to the last string.\n   - If a letter is encountered, append it to the current string being built.\n3. **Final Result**: After processing all characters, the current string will be the fully decoded string.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction decodeString(s):\n    initialize stack as empty\n    initialize current_string as empty string\n    initialize current_num as 0\n\n    for each character in s:\n        if character is a digit:\n            update current_num to be current_num * 10 + int(character)\n        else if character is '[':\n            push (current_string, current_num) onto stack\n            reset current_string to empty string\n            reset current_num to 0\n        else if character is ']':\n            pop (last_string, repeat_count) from stack\n            update current_string to be last_string + current_string repeated repeat_count times\n        else:\n            append character to current_string\n\n    return current_string\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        # Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and repeat counts\n        stack = []\n        current_string = \"\"\n        current_num = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each character in the input string\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                # If the character is a digit, update the current number\n                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)\n            elif char == '[':\n                # If an opening bracket is encountered, push the current string and number onto the stack\n                stack.append((current_string, current_num))\n                # Reset current string and number for the new context\n                current_string = \"\"\n                current_num = 0\n            elif char == ']':\n                # If a closing bracket is encountered, pop from the stack\n                last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                # Update the current string by repeating it and appending to the last string\n                current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n            else:\n                # If it's a letter, append it to the current string\n                current_string += char\n        \n        # The final decoded string is stored in current_string\n        return current_string\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently decodes the string by using a stack to manage nested patterns and repeat counts, ensuring that all encoded segments are expanded correctly.",
