INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string that is encoded using a specific format: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a substring that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such encoded patterns. The input string is guaranteed to be valid, meaning it will not contain any malformed brackets or unexpected characters.

## Conceptual Solution

To decode the string, we need to process it character by character. We can use a stack to help manage nested encoded patterns. Here's the plan:

1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and numbers.
2. Iterate over each character in the string:
   - If the character is a digit, build the complete number (since numbers can have multiple digits).
   - If the character is `[`, push the current number and the current string onto the stack, then reset them.
   - If the character is `]`, pop from the stack to get the last string and the number, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last string.
   - If the character is a letter, append it to the current string.
3. At the end of the iteration, the current string will contain the fully decoded string.

## Pseudocode

```
function decodeString(s):
    stack = []
    current_string = ""
    current_number = 0

    for each character in s:
        if character is a digit:
            update current_number
        else if character is '[':
            push (current_string, current_number) to stack
            reset current_string to ""
            reset current_number to 0
        else if character is ']':
            pop (last_string, number) from stack
            current_string = last_string + (current_string repeated number times)
        else:
            append character to current_string

    return current_string
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and numbers
        stack = []
        current_string = ""
        current_number = 0

        # Iterate over each character in the input string
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # If the character is a digit, update the current number
                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                # If the character is '[', push the current string and number onto the stack
                stack.append((current_string, current_number))
                # Reset the current string and number
                current_string = ""
                current_number = 0
            elif char == ']':
                # If the character is ']', pop from the stack
                last_string, number = stack.pop()
                # Repeat the current string 'number' times and append to the last string
                current_string = last_string + current_string * number
            else:
                # If the character is a letter, append it to the current string
                current_string += char

        # Return the fully decoded string
        return current_string

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of removing consecutive "abc" substrings from a given string until none remain. The key insight is to use a loop to repeatedly search for and remove the "abc" substring until it no longer exists in the string.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Iterative Removal**: Both solutions use a loop to continuously remove "abc" from the string. This ensures that all occurrences are removed, even if new ones are formed after an initial removal.

    2. **String Replacement**: The use of the `replace` method is crucial. It allows for the efficient removal of the first occurrence of "abc" in my solution, and all occurrences in the official solution. The difference is subtle but both achieve the same end result due to the loop.

    3. **Efficiency Considerations**: The official solution uses `s.count("abc")` to check for the presence of "abc", which might be slightly less efficient than checking directly with `"abc" in s` as in my solution. However, given the constraints, both approaches are acceptable.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions are similar in approach and efficiency. The main takeaway is the effective use of string manipulation methods in Python to iteratively transform a string based on specific patterns.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an encoded string that follows a specific pattern: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a string that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns into their repeated forms. The input string is guaranteed to be valid, with well-formed brackets and no extraneous spaces.

## Conceptual Solution

To decode the string, we need to process it character by character, handling numbers, letters, and brackets appropriately. We can use a stack to help manage nested patterns:

1. **Stack Usage**: Use a stack to keep track of the current string being built and the repeat count for nested patterns.
2. **Iterate Through String**: Traverse the string character by character.
   - If a digit is encountered, determine the full number (as it may be more than one digit).
   - If an opening bracket `[` is encountered, push the current string and repeat count onto the stack and reset them for the new pattern.
   - If a closing bracket `]` is encountered, pop from the stack to get the last string and repeat count, then append the current string repeated `k` times to the last string.
   - If a letter is encountered, append it to the current string being built.
3. **Final Result**: After processing all characters, the current string will be the fully decoded string.

## Pseudocode

```
function decodeString(s):
    initialize stack as empty
    initialize current_string as empty string
    initialize current_num as 0

    for each character in s:
        if character is a digit:
            update current_num to be current_num * 10 + int(character)
        else if character is '[':
            push (current_string, current_num) onto stack
            reset current_string to empty string
            reset current_num to 0
        else if character is ']':
            pop (last_string, repeat_count) from stack
            update current_string to be last_string + current_string repeated repeat_count times
        else:
            append character to current_string

    return current_string

        stack = []

        current_num = 0
        
        # Iterate over each character in the input string
        for char in s:

        # The final decoded string is stored in current_string

This solution efficiently decodes the string by using a stack to manage nested patterns and repeat counts, ensuring that all encoded segments are expanded correctly.

   - If a closing bracket `]` is encountered, pop from the stack to get the last string and repeat count, then append the current string repeated `k` times to the last string.
   - If a letter is encountered, append it to the current string being built.
3. **Final Result**: After processing all characters, the current string will be the fully decoded string.

## Pseudocode

```
function decodeString(s):
    initialize stack as empty
    initialize current_string as empty string
    initialize current_num as 0

    for each character in s:
        if character is a digit:
            update current_num to be current_num * 10 + int(character)
        else if character is '[':
            push (current_string, current_num) onto stack
            reset current_string to empty string
            reset current_num to 0
        else if character is ']':
            pop (last_string, repeat_count) from stack
            update current_string to be last_string + current_string repeated repeat_count times
        else:
            append character to current_string

    return current_string
```

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to decode a string that follows a specific pattern of `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The challenge was to handle nested patterns and ensure that the decoding process correctly expanded all segments.

The successful strategy involved using a stack to manage the current state of the string being built and the repeat counts for nested patterns. By iterating through the string character by character, we could handle digits, letters, and brackets appropriately:

- **Digits** were used to build the repeat count.
- **Opening brackets `[`** signaled the start of a new pattern, prompting us to push the current string and repeat count onto the stack and reset them for the new context.
- **Closing brackets `]`** indicated the end of a pattern, requiring us to pop from the stack and append the repeated current string to the last string.
- **Letters** were simply appended to the current string being built.

This approach effectively handled nested patterns by leveraging the stack to maintain context, ensuring that each segment was expanded correctly. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues. This problem reinforced the utility of stacks in managing nested structures and contexts in string processing tasks.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

INFO - [Task id] 146 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an encoded string that follows a specific pattern: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a string that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns into their repeated forms. The input string is guaranteed to be valid, with well-formed brackets and no extraneous spaces.

## Conceptual Solution

To decode the string, we need to process it character by character, handling numbers, letters, and brackets appropriately. We can use a stack to help manage nested patterns:

1. **Stack Usage**: Use a stack to keep track of the current string being built and the repeat count for nested patterns.
2. **Iterate Through String**: Traverse the string character by character.
   - If a digit is encountered, determine the full number (as it may be more than one digit).
   - If an opening bracket `[` is encountered, push the current string and repeat count onto the stack and reset them for the new pattern.
   - If a closing bracket `]` is encountered, pop from the stack to get the last string and repeat count, then append the current string repeated `k` times to the last string.
   - If a letter is encountered, append it to the current string being built.
3. **Final Result**: After processing all characters, the current string will be the fully decoded string.

## Pseudocode

```
function decodeString(s):
    initialize stack as empty
    initialize current_string as empty string
    initialize current_num as 0

    for each character in s:
        if character is a digit:
            update current_num to be current_num * 10 + int(character)
        else if character is '[':
            push (current_string, current_num) onto stack
            reset current_string to empty string
            reset current_num to 0
        else if character is ']':
            pop (last_string, repeat_count) from stack
            update current_string to be last_string + current_string repeated repeat_count times
        else:
            append character to current_string

    return current_string
```

    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:

         return stack[0][0]
 


INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] The official solution to the problem of decoding a string using the `k[encoded_string]` pattern is quite similar to my approach, but it introduces a few optimizations and simplifications that are worth noting:

1. **Stack Initialization**: The official solution initializes the stack with a default entry `["", 1]`. This ensures that there is always a base string to append to, which simplifies the logic when handling the closing bracket `]`.

2. **Handling Numbers**: Instead of maintaining a separate `current_num` variable, the official solution uses a string `num` to accumulate digits. This is then converted to an integer when a `[` is encountered. This approach is more flexible and handles multi-digit numbers more naturally.

3. **Appending to Stack**: The official solution directly appends characters to the last string in the stack using `stack[-1][0] += ch`. This eliminates the need for a separate `current_string` variable, reducing the number of variables and making the code cleaner.

4. **Simplified Bracket Handling**: When a `]` is encountered, the solution pops the stack and multiplies the string by its repeat count, then appends it to the previous string in the stack. This is done in a single line, making the code concise and efficient.

Overall, the official solution is slightly more elegant and concise, primarily due to its effective use of the stack to manage both strings and repeat counts. It reduces the number of variables and operations needed, which can be beneficial for readability and maintainability. This experience reinforces the importance of leveraging data structures like stacks to manage nested patterns and state efficiently.
