+------+-----+------+

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (10 points):

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   Miu has a phone keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 maps to a set of letters. She types a string of digits, and we need to determine how many possible letter combinations can be formed from this string. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters:
     - 2: 3 letters (A, B, C)
     - 3: 3 letters (D, E, F)
     - 4: 3 letters (G, H, I)
     - 5: 3 letters (J, K, L)
     - 6: 3 letters (M, N, O)
     - 7: 4 letters (P, Q, R, S)
     - 8: 3 letters (T, U, V)
     - 9: 4 letters (W, X, Y, Z)
   - For each test case, calculate the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the number of letters for each digit in the string.
   - Use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the result is manageable.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function to map digits to the number of letters:
     Create a dictionary with keys as digits and values as the number of letters

   For each test case:
     Initialize a variable `result` to 1
     For each digit in the string S:
       Multiply `result` by the number of letters corresponding to the digit
       Take modulo 1000000007 of `result`
     Print the `result`
   ```

### Python Code

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def countPossibleStrings(T, test_cases):
    # Define the mapping of digits to the number of letters
    digit_to_letters_count = {
        '2': 3,  # ABC
        '3': 3,  # DEF
        '4': 3,  # GHI
        '5': 3,  # JKL
        '6': 3,  # MNO
        '7': 4,  # PQRS
        '8': 3,  # TUV
        '9': 4   # WXYZ
    }
    
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    # Process each test case
    for S in test_cases:
        result = 1
        # Calculate the number of possible strings for the given S
        for digit in S:
            result *= digit_to_letters_count[digit]
            result %= MOD  # Take modulo to keep the number manageable
        print(result)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])

# The following lines are the test cases
test_cases = data[1:T+1]

# Call the function with the input data
countPossibleStrings(T, test_cases)
```

This code reads input from standard input, processes each test case to calculate the number of possible strings, and prints the result for each test case. The results are computed using the mapping of digits to the number of letters and are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure they remain within a manageable range.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, with constraints on consecutive days and the first and last day. The key pattern is recognizing that for \( N > 3 \), the number of valid schedules can be expressed using a formula involving powers of 3, due to the constraints on dish selection.

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the strategy was to use a straightforward formula: \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \). The use of fast exponentiation with the `pow` function was correct, but the application of the modulo operation needed careful attention. The error was in not correctly applying the modulo operation to the entire expression, which led to incorrect results for larger values of \( N \).

    #### Fixes and Insights
    The solution was fixed by ensuring that the modulo operation was applied to the entire calculation, especially when dealing with large powers. The `pow` function was used to efficiently compute \( 3^{(N-2)} \mod (10^9 + 7) \). This experience reinforced the importance of correctly applying modulo operations in problems involving large numbers and exponentiation.

    #### Final Correct Code
    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return (4 * 3) % MOD
        elif N == 3:
            return (4 * 3 * 2) % MOD
        else:
            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)
            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    main()
    ```

    This code correctly computes the number of valid schedules for each test case, taking into account the constraints and using modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

We have a phone keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 maps to a set of letters. Given a string of digits, we need to determine how many possible letter combinations can be formed by substituting each digit with any of its corresponding letters. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Mapping Digits to Letters**: Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific set of letters:
   - 2: ABC (3 letters)
   - 3: DEF (3 letters)
   - 4: GHI (3 letters)
   - 5: JKL (3 letters)
   - 6: MNO (3 letters)
   - 7: PQRS (4 letters)
   - 8: TUV (3 letters)
   - 9: WXYZ (4 letters)

2. **Calculate Combinations**: For each digit in the string, determine the number of possible letters it can represent. Multiply these numbers together to get the total number of possible combinations for the string.

3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the number of combinations can be very large, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The solution should handle multiple test cases as specified by the input.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_combinations(S):
    MOD = 1000000007
    digit_to_count = {
        '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3,
        '7': 4, '8': 3, '9': 4
    }
    result = 1
    for digit in S:
        result = (result * digit_to_count[digit]) % MOD
    return result

function main():
    read T from input
    for each test case:
        read S from input
        print calculate_combinations(S)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def calculate_combinations(S):
    MOD = 1000000007
    digit_to_count = {
        '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3,

    }
    result = 1

On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a phone keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 maps to a set of letters. Given a string of digits, we need to determine how many possible letter combinations can be formed by substituting each digit with any of its corresponding letters. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Mapping Digits to Letters**: Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific set of letters:
   - 2: ABC (3 letters)
   - 3: DEF (3 letters)
   - 4: GHI (3 letters)
   - 5: JKL (3 letters)
   - 6: MNO (3 letters)
   - 7: PQRS (4 letters)
   - 8: TUV (3 letters)
   - 9: WXYZ (4 letters)

2. **Calculate Combinations**: For each digit in the string, determine the number of possible letters it can represent. Multiply these numbers together to get the total number of possible combinations for the string.

3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the number of combinations can be very large, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The solution should handle multiple test cases as specified by the input.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_combinations(S):
    MOD = 1000000007
    digit_to_count = {
        '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3,
        '7': 4, '8': 3, '9': 4
    }
    result = 1
    for digit in S:
        result = (result * digit_to_count[digit]) % MOD
    return result

function main():
    read T from input
    for each test case:
        read S from input
        print calculate_combinations(S)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def calculate_combinations(S):
    MOD = 1000000007
    digit_to_count = {
        '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3,
        '7': 4, '8': 3, '9': 4
    }
    result = 1
    for digit in S:
        result = (result * digit_to_count[digit]) % MOD
    return result

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        S = data[i]
        result = calculate_combinations(S)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

main()
```

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was mapping digits on a phone keypad to their corresponding letters and calculating the number of possible letter combinations for a given string of digits. The key insight was recognizing that each digit from 2 to 9 maps to a specific number of letters, and the total number of combinations is the product of these counts for each digit in the string.

The strategy that worked was straightforward: use a dictionary to map each digit to the number of letters it represents, iterate over the input string, and multiply the counts together, applying a modulo operation to handle large numbers. This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially with the string length potentially reaching up to 100,000 characters.

The solution was implemented in Python, using standard input and output handling to accommodate multiple test cases. The use of a modulo operation with \(10^9 + 7\) ensured that the results remained within manageable limits, preventing overflow issues. The problem was solved without encountering unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases successfully. This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and efficiently mapping inputs to outputs using basic data structures like dictionaries.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.
+------+-----+------+
|   1  |  2  |   3  |
|      | ABC |  DEF |
+------+-----+------+
|   4  |  5  |   6  |
|  GHI | JKL |  MNO |
+------+-----+------+
|   7  |  8  |   9  |
| PQRS | TUV | WXYZ |
+------+-----+------+
|      |  0  |      |
+------+-----+------+

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----Subtasks-----

-----Sample Output:-----

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution aim to calculate the number of possible letter combinations for a given string of digits, using the mapping of digits to letters on a phone keypad. Here are some insights and comparisons between the two approaches:

1. **Digit to Letter Mapping**:
   - Both solutions correctly map each digit to the number of possible letters it can represent. My solution uses a dictionary for this mapping, while the official solution uses conditional checks within a loop.

2. **Handling of Input**:
   - My solution reads all input at once and processes it, which is efficient for handling multiple test cases. The official solution reads input one test case at a time, which is straightforward but might be less efficient for large input sizes.

3. **Computation of Combinations**:
   - Both solutions multiply the number of possible letters for each digit to get the total number of combinations. This is done using a loop that iterates over each digit in the input string.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Both solutions apply the modulo operation to handle large numbers, ensuring the result fits within standard integer limits.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The official solution includes a check for when the result is 1, printing "0" in such cases. This seems to handle a specific edge case, possibly when the input is invalid or results in no valid combinations. My solution does not include this check, as it assumes valid input based on the problem constraints.

Overall, both solutions are effective, but the official solution uses a more direct approach with conditional checks, while my solution uses a dictionary for clarity and ease of mapping. The key takeaway is the importance of handling input efficiently and ensuring that all edge cases are considered, especially when dealing with large input sizes and constraints.
