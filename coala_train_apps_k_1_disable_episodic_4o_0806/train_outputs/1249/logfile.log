## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 40
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file â‰¤ 106
- 0 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a number of test cases. For each test case, we have two integers, N and K. We need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair in the permutation equals K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):** 
   - For a permutation P of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair in the permutation.
   - For example, if P = [p1, p2, ..., pN], then f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

2. **Constraints and Observations:**
   - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.
   - The minimum possible value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.

3. **Approach:**
   - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

4. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - Start with the permutation [N, N-1, ..., 1].
   - Calculate the current sum of maximums.
   - If the current sum is greater than K, swap elements to reduce the sum until it equals K.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(N, K):
    max_sum = N + (N-1) + ... + 2
    min_sum = N - 1
    
    if K < min_sum or K > max_sum:
        return -1
    
    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
    current_sum = max_sum
    
    for i from 0 to N-2:
        if current_sum == K:
            break
        # Try to reduce the sum by swapping
        for j from N-1 down to i+1:
            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                swap(permutation[i], permutation[j])
                break
    
    return permutation

read T
for each test case:
    read N, K
    result = find_permutation(N, K)
    print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_permutation(N, K):
    # Calculate the maximum and minimum possible sums
    max_sum = sum(range(2, N + 1))
    min_sum = N - 1
    
    # If K is out of the possible range, return -1
    if K < min_sum or K > max_sum:
        return -1
    
    # Start with the permutation in decreasing order
    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
    current_sum = max_sum
    
    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
    for i in range(N - 1):
        if current_sum == K:
            break
        # Try to reduce the sum by swapping
        for j in range(N - 1, i, -1):
            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]
                break
    
    return permutation

import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    K = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    result = find_permutation(N, K)
    if result == -1:
        results.append("-1")
    else:
        results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))

sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the required permutation or -1 if no valid permutation exists. The function `find_permutation` constructs the permutation by starting with the maximum possible sum and adjusting it to match K.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Alternating Sum Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum from a sequence of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated as `a1 - a2 + a3 - a4 + ...`. The challenge is to select a subsequence that maximizes this sum. The key insight is to strategically choose elements such that larger values are placed at odd indices (1-based) and smaller values at even indices to maximize the sum.

    #### Strategies and Mistakes
    Initially, I attempted a straightforward approach by alternating between adding and subtracting based on index parity. This approach failed because it didn't consider the values of the elements, leading to suboptimal results. The next attempt involved comparing consecutive elements to decide whether to switch between adding and subtracting, but this also didn't yield the correct results.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct strategy involves iterating through the list and selectively including elements based on their contribution to the alternating sum. The solution should start by adding the first element and then decide whether to continue adding or switch to subtracting based on the potential increase in the sum. This requires a more dynamic approach, considering the values of the elements rather than their positions alone.

    #### Lessons Learned
    - The importance of understanding the problem's requirements and constraints deeply before jumping into coding.
    - The need to consider both the values and positions of elements when dealing with problems involving alternating sums or similar patterns.
    - The value of iteratively refining the approach based on test case feedback and understanding where the logic fails.

    This experience highlighted the importance of strategic element selection in maximizing sums and the pitfalls of relying solely on index-based operations without considering element values.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and a function f(P) that calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. The task is to find a permutation such that f(P) equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding f(P):** The function f(P) is the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this involves N-1 pairs.

2. **Maximum Possible f(P):** The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., from N to 2. This is because each pair can contribute its larger element to the sum.

3. **Minimum Possible f(P):** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.

4. **Feasibility Check:** If K is less than N-1 or greater than the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.

5. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum f(P).
   - If the current f(P) is greater than K, adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(N, K):
    max_f = sum of numbers from N to 2
    min_f = N - 1
    
    if K < min_f or K > max_f:
        return -1
    
    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
    current_f = max_f
    
    for i from 0 to N-2:
        if current_f == K:
            break
        if current_f - (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1]) >= K:

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 40
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file â‰¤ 106
- 0 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and a function f(P) that calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. The task is to find a permutation such that f(P) equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding f(P):** The function f(P) is the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this involves N-1 pairs.

2. **Maximum Possible f(P):** The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., from N to 2. This is because each pair can contribute its larger element to the sum.

3. **Minimum Possible f(P):** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.

4. **Feasibility Check:** If K is less than N-1 or greater than the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.

5. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum f(P).
   - If the current f(P) is greater than K, adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(N, K):
    max_f = sum of numbers from N to 2
    min_f = N - 1
    
    if K < min_f or K > max_f:
        return -1
    
    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
    current_f = max_f
    
    for i from 0 to N-2:
        if current_f == K:
            break
        if current_f - (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1]) >= K:
            current_f -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1])
            swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
    
    return permutation
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_permutation(N, K):
    # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)
    max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
    # Calculate the minimum possible value of f(P)

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Function f(P):** The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation P of numbers from 1 to N.

2. **Constraints on f(P):**
   - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.

3. **Objective:** For each test case, find a permutation such that f(P) equals a given integer K, or determine that no such permutation exists.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Initial Approach:**
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum f(P).
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K.

2. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic for adjusting the permutation might not be correctly implemented.
   - The permutation might not be adjusted correctly to reach the desired K.
   - The function might not be called correctly, or the input/output handling might be incorrect.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Function Call:** The `main()` function is defined but not called. This would result in no output being generated.

2. **Permutation Adjustment Logic:** The logic for adjusting the permutation might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the desired K is not directly reachable by simple swaps.

3. **Output Handling:** The output might not be formatted correctly, or the permutation might not be printed in the expected order.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Ensure the `main()` function is called** to execute the solution.
2. **Review the permutation adjustment logic** to ensure it correctly modifies the permutation to achieve the desired f(P).
3. **Check the output format** to ensure it matches the expected output.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind.

```python
def find_permutation(N, K):
    # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)
    max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
    # Calculate the minimum possible value of f(P)
    min_f = N - 1
    
    # If K is out of the possible range, return -1

        return -1
    
    # Start with the permutation in decreasing order
    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
    current_f = max_f

            break
        # Calculate the potential decrease in f(P) by swapping
        decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
        if current_f - decrease >= K:
            current_f -= decrease
            # Swap the elements to decrease f(P)
            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
    
    return permutation

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        result = find_permutation(N, K)
        if result == -1:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

# Call the main function to execute the solution

```

This revised solution ensures that the `main()` function is called, and it should correctly handle input and output. The permutation adjustment logic is also reviewed to ensure it correctly modifies the permutation to achieve the desired f(P).

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, there are several insights and takeaways:

    1. **Prefix Sum Efficiency**: My approach utilized a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of subarrays in constant time. This is a common technique in competitive programming to handle range sum queries efficiently, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, uses a direct summation approach within each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs due to its O(N) complexity per query.

    2. **Function Execution**: A key mistake in my initial solution was not calling the function that contained the main logic. This oversight led to no output being generated, which is a common pitfall when structuring code in functions without ensuring they are executed.

    3. **Input Handling**: Both my solution and the official solution handle input parsing effectively, but my approach used `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once, which is often more efficient in competitive programming settings where input size can be large.

    4. **Modulo Operation**: The official solution includes a modulo operation with `1000000000` during summation, which was not specified in the problem statement provided. This could be a requirement in some contexts to prevent overflow, but it was not necessary in the problem as I understood it.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient data structures like prefix sums for handling range queries and the necessity of ensuring that all parts of the code, especially function calls, are correctly implemented to produce the desired output.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 40
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file â‰¤ 106
- 0 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and a function f(P) that calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. The task is to find a permutation such that f(P) equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding f(P):** The function f(P) is the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this involves N-1 pairs.

2. **Maximum Possible f(P):** The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., from N to 2. This is because each pair can contribute its larger element to the sum.

3. **Minimum Possible f(P):** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.

4. **Feasibility Check:** If K is less than N-1 or greater than the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.

5. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum f(P).
   - If the current f(P) is greater than K, adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(N, K):
    max_f = sum of numbers from N to 2
    min_f = N - 1
    
    if K < min_f or K > max_f:
        return -1
    
    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
    current_f = max_f
    
    for i from 0 to N-2:
        if current_f == K:
            break
        if current_f - (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1]) >= K:
            current_f -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1])
            swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
    
    return permutation
```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Function f(P):** The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation P of numbers from 1 to N.

2. **Constraints on f(P):**
   - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.
   - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., from N to 2.

3. **Objective:** For each test case, find a permutation such that f(P) equals a given integer K, or determine that no such permutation exists.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Initial Approach:**
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum f(P).
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K.

2. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic for adjusting the permutation might not be correctly implemented.
   - The permutation might not be adjusted correctly to reach the desired K.
   - The function might not be called correctly, or the input/output handling might be incorrect.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Function Call:** The `main()` function is defined but not called. This would result in no output being generated.

2. **Permutation Adjustment Logic:** The logic for adjusting the permutation might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the desired K is not directly reachable by simple swaps.

3. **Output Handling:** The output might not be formatted correctly, or the permutation might not be printed in the expected order.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Ensure the `main()` function is called** to execute the solution.
2. **Review the permutation adjustment logic** to ensure it correctly modifies the permutation to achieve the desired f(P).
3. **Check the output format** to ensure it matches the expected output.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind.

```python
def find_permutation(N, K):
    # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)
    max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
    # Calculate the minimum possible value of f(P)

        if current_f - decrease >= K:
            current_f -= decrease
            # Swap the elements to decrease f(P)
            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
    
    return permutation

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        result = find_permutation(N, K)

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

### Key Concepts:
- **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
- **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

### Strategies:
- **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
- **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

### Challenges and Fixes:
- **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
- **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

### Code Snippet:
```python
def find_permutation(N, K):
    max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
    min_f = N - 1
    if K < min_f or K > max_f:
        return -1
    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
    current_f = max_f
    for i in range(N - 1):
        if current_f == K:
            break
        decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
        if current_f - decrease >= K:
            current_f -= decrease
            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 40
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file â‰¤ 106
- 0 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and a function f(P) that calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. The task is to find a permutation such that f(P) equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding f(P):** The function f(P) is the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this involves N-1 pairs.

2. **Maximum Possible f(P):** The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., from N to 2. This is because each pair can contribute its larger element to the sum.

3. **Minimum Possible f(P):** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.

4. **Feasibility Check:** If K is less than N-1 or greater than the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, it is impossible to find such a permutation, and we should return -1.

5. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum f(P).
   - If the current f(P) is greater than K, adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(N, K):
    max_f = sum of numbers from N to 2
    min_f = N - 1
    
    if K < min_f or K > max_f:
        return -1
    
    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
    current_f = max_f
    
    for i from 0 to N-2:
        if current_f == K:
            break
        if current_f - (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1]) >= K:
            current_f -= (permutation[i] - permutation[i+1])
            swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
    
    return permutation
```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Function f(P):** The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation P of numbers from 1 to N.

2. **Constraints on f(P):**
   - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.
   - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., from N to 2.

3. **Objective:** For each test case, find a permutation such that f(P) equals a given integer K, or determine that no such permutation exists.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Initial Approach:**
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum f(P).
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K.

2. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic for adjusting the permutation might not be correctly implemented.
   - The permutation might not be adjusted correctly to reach the desired K.
   - The function might not be called correctly, or the input/output handling might be incorrect.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Function Call:** The `main()` function is defined but not called. This would result in no output being generated.

2. **Permutation Adjustment Logic:** The logic for adjusting the permutation might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the desired K is not directly reachable by simple swaps.

3. **Output Handling:** The output might not be formatted correctly, or the permutation might not be printed in the expected order.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Ensure the `main()` function is called** to execute the solution.
2. **Review the permutation adjustment logic** to ensure it correctly modifies the permutation to achieve the desired f(P).
3. **Check the output format** to ensure it matches the expected output.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind.

```python
def find_permutation(N, K):
    # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)
    max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
    # Calculate the minimum possible value of f(P)
    min_f = N - 1
    
    # If K is out of the possible range, return -1

        return -1
    
    # Start with the permutation in decreasing order
    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
    current_f = max_f
    
    # Adjust the permutation to match the desired K
    for i in range(N - 1):

            break
        # Calculate the potential decrease in f(P) by swapping
        decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
        if current_f - decrease >= K:
            current_f -= decrease
            # Swap the elements to decrease f(P)
            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
    
    return permutation

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        result = find_permutation(N, K)
        if result == -1:
            results.append("-1")
        else:

    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

# Call the main function to execute the solution

```

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Understanding the Range of f(P):** Both my solution and the official solution correctly identified the range of possible values for f(P). The minimum value is \(N-1\) and the maximum value is the sum of the largest \(N-1\) numbers. This is crucial for quickly determining if a solution is possible.

2. **Permutation Construction:** My approach involved starting with a permutation in decreasing order and adjusting it to match the desired f(P). The official solution, however, uses a more structured approach by considering the parity of N (even or odd) and directly constructing the permutation based on the difference between K and the minimum possible f(P).

3. **Handling Edge Cases:** The official solution explicitly handles edge cases, such as when N is 1 or when K is exactly the minimum possible f(P). This ensures that the solution is robust across all possible inputs.

4. **Efficiency and Clarity:** The official solution is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it directly constructs the permutation without unnecessary swaps. It also uses clear mathematical reasoning to determine the feasibility of achieving a given K.

5. **Learning from Mistakes:** My initial solution failed to call the main function, which is a simple but critical oversight. Additionally, the logic for adjusting the permutation was not as direct or efficient as the official solution.

In summary, the official solution provides a more structured and efficient approach to constructing the desired permutation, especially by leveraging the properties of even and odd N. This experience highlights the importance of considering different strategies for constructing permutations and ensuring that all edge cases are handled.

The main function is `main`.
INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and for each test case, two integers N and K. It then processes each test case by calling another function to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific condition related to K is met. If a valid permutation is found, it is formatted as a space-separated string and added to the results list; otherwise, "-1" is added to the results. Finally, the function outputs all results, each on a new line, to standard output.

[Problem]
    For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
    You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
    Note f([1]) = 0.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
    - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
    Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 40
    - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
    - Sum of N over all test cases in each file â‰¤ 106
    - 0 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 2 * 1010

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    3
    4 12
    2 2
    5 14

    Output:
    -1
    1 2
    5 4 3 2 1

    -----Explanation-----
    Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
    Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
    Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.
