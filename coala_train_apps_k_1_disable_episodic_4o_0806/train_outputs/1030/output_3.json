    "raw_msg": "### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe previous solution was incorrect because it attempted to count pairs `(w, t)` by iterating over all possible nodes up to `n` and checking if they share the same lowest common ancestor (LCA) as `(u, v)`. This approach is inefficient and incorrect for large `n`.\n\n### Correct Approach\n\nTo solve the problem efficiently, we need to focus on the properties of the binary tree and the path configuration:\n\n1. **Path Configuration**: The path from `u` to `v` is determined by their lowest common ancestor (LCA). The path configuration is unique for each LCA.\n\n2. **Counting Pairs**: Instead of checking all pairs `(w, t)`, we need to determine how many pairs share the same LCA as `(u, v)`.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For a given LCA, the number of pairs `(w, t)` that have this LCA can be determined by counting the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\n1. **Find LCA**: Use the properties of the binary tree to find the LCA of `u` and `v`.\n\n2. **Count Nodes in Subtree**: Calculate the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA. This can be done by considering the range of node labels that fall under this subtree.\n\n3. **Output the Count**: For each query, output the number of such pairs.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef parent(v):\n    if v % 2 == 0:\n        return v // 2\n    else:\n        return (v - 1) // 2\n\ndef findLCA(x, y):\n    while x != y:\n        if x > y:\n            x = parent(x)\n        else:\n            y = parent(y)\n    return x\n\ndef countPairsWithSameLCA(n, u, v):\n    lca_uv = findLCA(u, v)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at lca_uv\n    # The subtree rooted at lca_uv includes all nodes from lca_uv to n\n    count = 0\n    for w in range(1, n + 1):\n        if findLCA(w, lca_uv) == lca_uv:\n            count += 1\n    \n    return count\n\ndef processQueries(queries):\n    results = []\n    for n, u, v in queries:\n        result = countPairsWithSameLCA(n, u, v)\n        results.append(result)\n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\nQ = int(data[0])\nqueries = []\nindex = 1\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    n = int(data[index])\n    u = int(data[index + 1])\n    v = int(data[index + 2])\n    queries.append((n, u, v))\n    index += 3\n\n# Process queries and output results\nresults = processQueries(queries)\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Parent Function**: This function calculates the parent of a given node `v` based on whether `v` is even or odd.\n\n2. **Find LCA**: This function finds the lowest common ancestor of two nodes `x` and `y` by moving both nodes up the tree until they meet.\n\n3. **Count Pairs**: This function counts the number of pairs `(w, t)` such that the LCA of `w` and `t` is the same as the LCA of `u` and `v`. It iterates over all possible nodes `w` and checks if the LCA of `w` and `lca_uv` is `lca_uv`.\n\n4. **Process Queries**: This function processes each query and stores the result.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the number of pairs `(w, t)` with the same path configuration as `(u, v)` by leveraging the properties of the binary tree and the concept of the lowest common ancestor.",
