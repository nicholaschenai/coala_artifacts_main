The root node is labeled `1`, and for any node labeled `v`, its left child is `2 * v` and its right child is `2 * v + 1`. We are given a series of queries, each with three integers `n`, `u`, and `v`. For each query, we need to count the number of pairs `(w, t)` such that the path configuration from `w` to `t` is the same as the path configuration from `u` to `v`, where `1 <= w, t <= n`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Path Configuration**: The path configuration from a node `u` to a node `v` is the unique sequence of moves (left, right, parent as left child, parent as right child) that transforms `u` into `v`.\n\n2. **Determine Path Configuration**: For each query, determine the path configuration from `u` to `v`. This involves:\n   - Moving up the tree from `u` and `v` until they meet at a common ancestor.\n   - Record the sequence of moves required to reach this common ancestor from both `u` and `v`.\n\n3. **Count Matching Pairs**: For each pair `(w, t)` where `1 <= w, t <= n`, check if the path configuration from `w` to `t` matches the path configuration from `u` to `v`. Count such pairs.\n\n4. **Efficiency Consideration**: Given the constraints, directly checking all pairs `(w, t)` is inefficient.

However, the approach was inefficient and incorrect because it involved checking all possible pairs `(w, t)` up to `n`, which is computationally expensive and not feasible given the constraints.\n\n### Mistakes in the Initial Solution\n\n1. **Inefficient Pair Checking**: The solution iterated over all possible pairs `(w, t)` up to `n`, which is not feasible for large `n` (up to `10^9`).\n\n2. **Misunderstanding of Path Configuration**: The solution did not correctly leverage the properties of the binary tree to efficiently determine the number of pairs with the same path configuration.\n\n### Correct Approach\n\nTo solve the problem efficiently, we need to focus on the properties of the binary tree and the path configuration:\n\n1. **Path Configuration**: The path from `u` to `v` is determined by their lowest common ancestor (LCA). The path configuration is unique for each LCA.\n\n2. **Counting Pairs**: Instead of checking all pairs `(w, t)`, we need to determine how many pairs share the same LCA as `(u, v)`.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For a given LCA, the number of pairs `(w, t)` that have this LCA can be determined by counting the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\n1. **Find LCA**: Use the properties of the binary tree to find the LCA of `u` and `v`.\n\n2. **Count Nodes in Subtree**: Calculate the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA. This can be done by considering the range of node labels that fall under this subtree.\n\n3. **Output the Count**: For each query, output the number of such pairs.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef parent(v):\n    if v % 2 == 0:\n        return v // 2\n    else:\n        return (v - 1) // 2\n\ndef findLCA(x, y):\n    while x != y:\n        if x > y:\n            x = parent(x)\n        else:\n            y = parent(y)\n    return x\n\ndef countPairsWithSameLCA(n, u, v):\n    lca_uv = findLCA(u, v)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at lca_uv\n    # The subtree rooted at lca_uv includes all nodes from lca_uv to n\n    count = 0\n    for w in range(1, n + 1):\n        if findLCA(w, lca_uv) == lca_uv:\n            count += 1\n    \n    return count\n\ndef processQueries(queries):\n    results = []\n    for n, u, v in queries:\n        result = countPairsWithSameLCA(n, u, v)\n        results.append(result)\n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\nQ = int(data[0])\nqueries = []\nindex = 1\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    n = int(data[index])\n    u = int(data[index + 1])\n    v = int(data[index + 2])\n    queries.append((n, u, v))\n    index += 3\n\n# Process queries and output results\nresults = processQueries(queries)\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the number of pairs `(w, t)` with the same path configuration as `(u, v)` by leveraging the properties of the binary tree and the concept of the lowest common ancestor."

The core concepts involved include tree traversal, pathfinding in trees, and efficient LIS calculation using dynamic programming with binary search.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Strategies\n\n    1. **Tree Representation**: The tree was represented using an adjacency list, which is efficient for traversal operations like DFS or BFS. This representation is crucial for efficiently finding paths in a tree structure.\n\n    2. **Pathfinding in Trees**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path from the root to any vertex is unique. We used Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and maintain the path from the root to each vertex.\n\n    3. **LIS Calculation**: The LIS was calculated using a dynamic programming approach with binary search, which is efficient with a time complexity of `O(L log L)`, where `L` is the length of the sequence. This method involves maintaining a list that stores the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences of different lengths.\n\n    ### Challenges and Solutions\n\n    - **Input Handling**: Initially, the code did not execute because the `main()` function was not called. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by explicitly calling `main()` at the end of the script.\n\n    - **Output Format**: Ensuring the output was printed correctly, with each LIS length on a new line, was crucial for passing the tests.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    Here's the core function for calculating the LIS, which was central to solving the problem:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_lis(sequence):\n        if not sequence:\n            return 0\n    \n        lis = []\n        for value in sequence:\n            low, high = 0, len(lis)\n            while low < high:\n                mid = (low + high) // 2\n                if lis[mid] < value:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid\n            if low == len(lis):\n                lis.append(value)\n            else:\n                lis[low] = value\n    \n        return len(lis)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of efficient data structures and algorithms for pathfinding and subsequence problems, especially in large datasets.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This approach is inefficient and incorrect for large `n`.\n\n### Correct Approach\n\nTo solve the problem efficiently, we need to focus on the properties of the binary tree and the path configuration:\n\n1. **Path Configuration**: The path from `u` to `v` is determined by their lowest common ancestor (LCA). The path configuration is unique for each LCA.\n\n2. **Counting Pairs**: Instead of checking all pairs `(w, t)`, we need to determine how many pairs share the same LCA as `(u, v)`.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For a given LCA, the number of pairs `(w, t)` that have this LCA can be determined by counting the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\n1. **Find LCA**: Use the properties of the binary tree to find the LCA of `u` and `v`.\n\n2. **Count Nodes in Subtree**: Calculate the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA. This can be done by considering the range of node labels that fall under this subtree.\n\n3. **Output the Count**: For each query, output the number of such pairs.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef parent(v):\n    if v % 2 == 0:\n        return v // 2\n    else:\n        return (v - 1) // 2\n\ndef findLCA(x, y):\n    while x != y:\n        if x > y:\n            x = parent(x)\n        else:\n            y = parent(y)\n    return x\n\ndef countPairsWithSameLCA(n, u, v):\n    lca_uv = findLCA(u, v)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at lca_uv\n    # The subtree rooted at lca_uv includes all nodes from lca_uv to n\n    count = 0\n    for w in range(1, n + 1):\n        if findLCA(w, lca_uv) == lca_uv:\n            count += 1\n    \n    return count\n\ndef processQueries(queries):\n    results = []\n    for n, u, v in queries:\n        result = countPairsWithSameLCA(n, u, v)\n        results.append(result)\n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\nQ = int(data[0])\nqueries = []\nindex = 1\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    n = int(data[index])\n    u = int(data[index + 1])\n    v = int(data[index + 2])\n    queries.append((n, u, v))\n    index += 3\n\n# Process queries and output results\nresults = processQueries(queries)\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Parent Function**: This function calculates the parent of a given node `v` based on whether `v` is even or odd.\n\n2. **Find LCA**: This function finds the lowest common ancestor of two nodes `x` and `y` by moving both nodes up the tree until they meet.\n\n3. **Count Pairs**: This function counts the number of pairs `(w, t)` such that the LCA of `w` and `t` is the same as the LCA of `u` and `v`. It iterates over all possible nodes `w` and checks if the LCA of `w` and `lca_uv` is `lca_uv`.\n\n4. **Process Queries**: This function processes each query and stores the result.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the number of pairs `(w, t)` with the same path configuration as `(u, v)` by leveraging the properties of the binary tree and the concept of the lowest common ancestor."

        "content": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Binary Tree Path Configuration Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\nThe problem revolves around understanding the structure of an infinite binary tree and the concept of path configurations between nodes. The key idea is that the path between any two nodes is uniquely determined by their lowest common ancestor (LCA). This problem tests the ability to efficiently compute the LCA and count node pairs with the same path configuration.\n\n#### Strategies and Mistakes\n\nInitially, I attempted to solve the problem by iterating over all possible node pairs `(w, t)` up to `n` and checking if they shared the same LCA as `(u, v)`. This approach was inefficient and incorrect due to the large possible size of `n` (up to `10^9`), making it computationally infeasible.\n\nThe mistake was in misunderstanding how to efficiently count pairs with the same path configuration. The solution should not involve iterating over all possible pairs but rather leverage the properties of the binary tree to directly compute the number of such pairs.\n\n#### Correct Approach\n\nThe correct approach involves:\n1. **Finding the LCA**: Use a simple loop to find the LCA of two nodes by moving them up the tree until they meet.\n2. **Counting Nodes in Subtree**: Once the LCA is found, determine the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA. This can be done by understanding the range of node labels that fall under this subtree.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\nThe main lesson from this problem is the importance of understanding the underlying structure and properties of the data (in this case, the binary tree) to devise an efficient solution. Iterating over all possibilities is often not feasible, especially with large constraints, and leveraging mathematical properties or data structures can lead to more efficient solutions."

My initial attempts failed because I misunderstood the problem's requirements and the properties of the binary tree, leading to inefficient and incorrect solutions.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: The official solution leverages the binary representation of numbers to determine the path configuration. This is insightful because the binary tree's structure directly corresponds to the binary representation of node labels.\n\n2. **Common Prefix**: The solution finds the longest common prefix of the binary representations of `u` and `v`. This common prefix determines the path to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of `u` and `v`.\n\n3. **Subtree Size Calculation**: By analyzing the binary representation, the solution efficiently calculates the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA. This is done by considering the remaining bits after the common prefix.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient because it avoids iterating over all possible pairs `(w, t)`. Instead, it uses bit manipulation and binary string operations to directly compute the result.\n\n#### Why My Approach Failed\n\n- **Inefficient Iteration**: My approach involved iterating over all possible pairs `(w, t)`, which is computationally expensive and infeasible for large `n`.\n- **Misunderstanding of Path Configuration**: I did not correctly leverage the binary tree's properties to determine the path configuration efficiently.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Binary Tree and Binary Representation**: Understanding the relationship between a binary tree's structure and binary number representation can lead to more efficient solutions.\n- **Avoid Brute Force**: For large constraints, it's crucial to find a mathematical or logical shortcut rather than relying on brute force.\n- **Leverage Common Patterns**: Identifying common patterns, such as the longest common prefix in binary strings, can simplify complex problems.\n\nThis experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem's underlying structure and leveraging efficient data representations to solve it effectively."
