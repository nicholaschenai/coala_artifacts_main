    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Binary Tree Path Configuration Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\nThe problem revolves around understanding the structure of an infinite binary tree and the concept of path configurations between nodes. The key idea is that the path between any two nodes is uniquely determined by their lowest common ancestor (LCA). This problem tests the ability to efficiently compute the LCA and count node pairs with the same path configuration.\n\n#### Strategies and Mistakes\n\nInitially, I attempted to solve the problem by iterating over all possible node pairs `(w, t)` up to `n` and checking if they shared the same LCA as `(u, v)`. This approach was inefficient and incorrect due to the large possible size of `n` (up to `10^9`), making it computationally infeasible.\n\nThe mistake was in misunderstanding how to efficiently count pairs with the same path configuration. The solution should not involve iterating over all possible pairs but rather leverage the properties of the binary tree to directly compute the number of such pairs.\n\n#### Correct Approach\n\nThe correct approach involves:\n1. **Finding the LCA**: Use a simple loop to find the LCA of two nodes by moving them up the tree until they meet.\n2. **Counting Nodes in Subtree**: Once the LCA is found, determine the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA. This can be done by understanding the range of node labels that fall under this subtree.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\nThe main lesson from this problem is the importance of understanding the underlying structure and properties of the data (in this case, the binary tree) to devise an efficient solution. Iterating over all possibilities is often not feasible, especially with large constraints, and leveraging mathematical properties or data structures can lead to more efficient solutions.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem and Solution\n\nThe problem involves finding the number of pairs `(w, t)` such that the path configuration from `w` to `t` is the same as the path configuration from `u` to `v` in an infinite binary tree. My initial attempts failed because I misunderstood the problem's requirements and the properties of the binary tree, leading to inefficient and incorrect solutions.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: The official solution leverages the binary representation of numbers to determine the path configuration. This is insightful because the binary tree's structure directly corresponds to the binary representation of node labels.\n\n2. **Common Prefix**: The solution finds the longest common prefix of the binary representations of `u` and `v`. This common prefix determines the path to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of `u` and `v`.\n\n3. **Subtree Size Calculation**: By analyzing the binary representation, the solution efficiently calculates the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA. This is done by considering the remaining bits after the common prefix.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient because it avoids iterating over all possible pairs `(w, t)`. Instead, it uses bit manipulation and binary string operations to directly compute the result.\n\n#### Why My Approach Failed\n\n- **Inefficient Iteration**: My approach involved iterating over all possible pairs `(w, t)`, which is computationally expensive and infeasible for large `n`.\n- **Misunderstanding of Path Configuration**: I did not correctly leverage the binary tree's properties to determine the path configuration efficiently.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Binary Tree and Binary Representation**: Understanding the relationship between a binary tree's structure and binary number representation can lead to more efficient solutions.\n- **Avoid Brute Force**: For large constraints, it's crucial to find a mathematical or logical shortcut rather than relying on brute force.\n- **Leverage Common Patterns**: Identifying common patterns, such as the longest common prefix in binary strings, can simplify complex problems.\n\nThis experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem's underlying structure and leveraging efficient data representations to solve it effectively.",
