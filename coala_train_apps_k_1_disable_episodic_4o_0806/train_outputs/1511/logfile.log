## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a row of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is calculated as `P = K + 1 - |j-i| - S`, where `|j-i|` is the distance between the magnet and iron, and `S` is the number of conducting sheets between them. The attraction is only possible if `P > 0` and there are no blocks ('X') between them. We need to find the maximum number of such magnet-iron pairs for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation**: First, split the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.
2. **Pairing**: For each segment, attempt to pair magnets and irons:
   - Use two lists to track the positions of magnets and irons.
   - Iterate through the segment, and for each magnet, try to find the nearest iron that can be attracted.
   - Calculate the attraction power considering the distance and the number of conducting sheets.
   - If the attraction power is positive, pair the magnet with the iron and remove both from their respective lists.
3. **Count Pairs**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the total result of the test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_magnets(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test case:
        N, K, S = test case
        segments = split S by 'X'
        total_pairs = 0
        for each segment in segments:
            magnets = []
            irons = []
            sheets_count = 0
            for each character in segment:
                if character is 'M':
                    add position to magnets
                if character is 'I':
                    add position to irons
                if character is ':':
                    increment sheets_count
            while both magnets and irons are not empty:
                magnet_pos = first element in magnets
                iron_pos = first element in irons
                distance = abs(magnet_pos - iron_pos)
                if magnet_pos < iron_pos:
                    sheets_between = count sheets between magnet_pos and iron_pos
                else:
                    sheets_between = count sheets between iron_pos and magnet_pos
                attraction_power = K + 1 - distance - sheets_between
                if attraction_power > 0:
                    increment total_pairs
                    remove first element from magnets
                    remove first element from irons
                else:
                    if magnet_pos < iron_pos:
                        remove first element from magnets
                    else:
                        remove first element from irons
        append total_pairs to results
    return results
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:

        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a row of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is calculated as \( P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j} \), where \( S_{i,j} \) is the number of conducting sheets between them. A magnet can attract iron if \( P_{i,j} > 0 \) and there are no blocks between them.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: First, split the string into segments separated by 'X' since no attraction can occur across a block.

2. **Iterate through Segments**: For each segment, identify positions of magnets and irons.

3. **Calculate Attraction Power**: For each magnet and iron pair within a segment, calculate the attraction power considering the number of conducting sheets between them.

4. **Match Magnets and Irons**: Use a greedy approach to match magnets and irons with positive attraction power, ensuring each iron is attracted by at most one magnet.

5. **Count Matches**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the final result.

### Pseudocode

```
function max_magnets(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, S = test_case
        segments = split S by 'X'

        for each segment in segments:
            magnets = positions of 'M' in segment
            irons = positions of 'I' in segment
            sheets_count = prefix sum of ':' in segment
            i, j = 0, 0
            matches = 0
            while i < len(magnets) and j < len(irons):
                m_pos = magnets[i]
                i_pos = irons[j]
                sheets_between = sheets_count[max(m_pos, i_pos)] - sheets_count[min(m_pos, i_pos)]
                attraction_power = K + 1 - abs(m_pos - i_pos) - sheets_between
                if attraction_power > 0:
                    matches += 1
                    i += 1
                    j += 1
                elif m_pos < i_pos:
                    i += 1
                else:
                    j += 1
            total_matches += matches
        results.append(total_matches)

 ### Problem Restatement

We have a row of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is calculated as \( P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j} \), where \( S_{i,j} \) is the number of conducting sheets between them. A magnet can attract iron if \( P_{i,j} > 0 \) and there are no blocks between them.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: First, split the string into segments separated by 'X' since no attraction can occur across a block.

2. **Iterate through Segments**: For each segment, identify positions of magnets and irons.

3. **Calculate Attraction Power**: For each magnet and iron pair within a segment, calculate the attraction power considering the number of conducting sheets between them.

4. **Match Magnets and Irons**: Use a greedy approach to match magnets and irons with positive attraction power, ensuring each iron is attracted by at most one magnet.

5. **Count Matches**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the final result.

        for each segment in segments:
            magnets = positions of 'M' in segment
            irons = positions of 'I' in segment
            sheets_count = prefix sum of ':' in segment
            i, j = 0, 0
            matches = 0
            while i < len(magnets) and j < len(irons):
                m_pos = magnets[i]
                i_pos = irons[j]
                sheets_between = sheets_count[max(m_pos, i_pos)] - sheets_count[min(m_pos, i_pos)]

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
4 5
I::M
9 10
MIM_XII:M

-----Example Output-----
1
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently match magnets ('M') with irons ('I') in a string, considering the constraints of attraction power and blockages ('X'). The key challenge was to handle the attraction power calculation, which depends on the distance between magnets and irons, the number of conducting sheets (':') between them, and ensuring no blockages exist between them.

The successful strategy involved segmenting the string by 'X' to isolate independent sections where attraction could occur. Within each segment, I tracked the positions of magnets and irons and used a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the number of conducting sheets between any two positions. A two-pointer technique was employed to match magnets and irons greedily, ensuring that each iron is attracted by at most one magnet.

This approach was efficient due to its linear complexity relative to the length of each segment, and it handled the constraints well. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness and efficiency. This problem reinforced the importance of segmenting problems into manageable parts and using efficient data structures like prefix sums for quick calculations.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
4 5
I::M
9 10
MIM_XII:M

-----Example Output-----
1
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a row of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is calculated as \( P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j} \), where \( S_{i,j} \) is the number of conducting sheets between them. A magnet can attract iron if \( P_{i,j} > 0 \) and there are no blocks between them.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: First, split the string into segments separated by 'X' since no attraction can occur across a block.

2. **Iterate through Segments**: For each segment, identify positions of magnets and irons.

3. **Calculate Attraction Power**: For each magnet and iron pair within a segment, calculate the attraction power considering the number of conducting sheets between them.

4. **Match Magnets and Irons**: Use a greedy approach to match magnets and irons with positive attraction power, ensuring each iron is attracted by at most one magnet.

5. **Count Matches**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the final result.

### Pseudocode

```
function max_magnets(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, S = test_case
        segments = split S by 'X'
        total_matches = 0
        for each segment in segments:
            magnets = positions of 'M' in segment
            irons = positions of 'I' in segment
            sheets_count = prefix sum of ':' in segment
            i, j = 0, 0
            matches = 0
            while i < len(magnets) and j < len(irons):
                m_pos = magnets[i]
                i_pos = irons[j]
                sheets_between = sheets_count[max(m_pos, i_pos)] - sheets_count[min(m_pos, i_pos)]
                attraction_power = K + 1 - abs(m_pos - i_pos) - sheets_between
                if attraction_power > 0:
                    matches += 1
                    i += 1
                    j += 1

            total_matches += matches
        results.append(total_matches)
    return results
```

The problem of matching magnets and irons with constraints was an interesting challenge that required careful consideration of the conditions for attraction. Here's a reflection on the approach and insights gained:

1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: Both my solution and the official solution correctly identified the need to segment the string by 'X' since no attraction can occur across a block. This is a crucial step to simplify the problem into manageable parts.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: The official solution uses a two-pointer technique to traverse the string, which is efficient for this type of problem. This approach allows simultaneous tracking of potential matches between magnets and irons, adjusting pointers based on conditions.

3. **Counting Conducting Sheets**: Both solutions correctly account for conducting sheets between magnets and irons, which affect the attraction power. The official solution does this inline, while my solution used a prefix sum array. The inline approach is simpler and avoids additional space usage.

4. **Greedy Matching**: The official solution uses a greedy approach to match magnets and irons, which is effective given the constraints. It checks the attraction power and moves pointers accordingly, ensuring each iron is matched with at most one magnet.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution handles edge cases like encountering a block ('X') by resetting pointers, which is a straightforward way to ensure no invalid matches occur across blocks.

Overall, the official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging a two-pointer technique and inline calculations to solve the problem effectively. This experience reinforced the utility of the two-pointer method in problems involving pair matching with constraints and the importance of segmenting input data to simplify complex conditions.
