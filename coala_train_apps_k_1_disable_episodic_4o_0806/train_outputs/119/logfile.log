## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Assume that you have $k$ one-dimensional segments $s_1, s_2, \dots s_k$ (each segment is denoted by two integers â€” its endpoints). Then you can build the following graph on these segments. The graph consists of $k$ vertexes, and there is an edge between the $i$-th and the $j$-th vertexes ($i \neq j$) if and only if the segments $s_i$ and $s_j$ intersect (there exists at least one point that belongs to both of them).

For example, if $s_1 = [1, 6], s_2 = [8, 20], s_3 = [4, 10], s_4 = [2, 13], s_5 = [17, 18]$, then the resulting graph is the following: [Image] 

A tree of size $m$ is good if it is possible to choose $m$ one-dimensional segments so that the graph built on these segments coincides with this tree.

You are given a tree, you have to find its good subtree with maximum possible size. Recall that a subtree is a connected subgraph of a tree.

Note that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 15 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of the queries. 

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree.

Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$) denoting an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer â€” the maximum size of a good subtree of the given tree.


-----Example-----

10
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
2 6
3 7
3 8
4 9
4 10

Output

-----Note-----

In the first query there is a good subtree of size $8$. The vertices belonging to this subtree are ${9, 4, 10, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3}$.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. For each query, we need to find the maximum size of a "good" subtree. A "good" subtree is a connected subgraph of the tree that can be represented by intersecting one-dimensional segments. The task is to determine the maximum number of vertices in such a subtree for each query.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. Each node can be connected to multiple other nodes, forming branches.

2. **Good Subtree Definition**: A good subtree is a connected subgraph that can be represented by intersecting segments. This means that for any two nodes in the subtree, there should be a path connecting them without leaving the subtree.

3. **Maximizing the Good Subtree**: The problem boils down to finding the largest connected subgraph that can be represented by intersecting segments. In a tree, this is equivalent to finding the largest subtree that can be formed by removing the least number of edges.

4. **Strategy**: 
   - For each node, consider it as the root of a potential subtree.
   - Calculate the size of the subtree rooted at each node.
   - The maximum size of a good subtree is the size of the largest subtree minus one (since we need to remove at least one edge to form a segment).

5. **Implementation**:
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and calculate the size of each subtree.
   - Track the maximum subtree size encountered during the traversal.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_max_good_subtree_size(tree):
    initialize max_size to 0
    define dfs(node, parent):
        initialize subtree_size to 1
        for each child in tree[node]:
            if child is not parent:
                subtree_size += dfs(child, node)
        update max_size with max(max_size, subtree_size)
        return subtree_size

    start dfs from any node (e.g., node 1)
    return max_size - 1

function process_queries(queries):
    for each query in queries:
        read number of vertices n
        read n-1 edges
        construct the tree as an adjacency list
        result = find_max_good_subtree_size(tree)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_max_good_subtree_size(tree, n):
    max_size = 0
    
    def dfs(node, parent):
        nonlocal max_size
        subtree_size = 1
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                subtree_size += dfs(child, node)
        max_size = max(max_size, subtree_size)
        return subtree_size
    
    # Start DFS from node 1 (or any node, since it's a connected tree)
    dfs(1, -1)
    return max_size - 1

def process_queries(queries):
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
        
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            x = int(data[index])
            y = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            tree[x].append(y)
            tree[y].append(x)
        
        result = find_max_good_subtree_size(tree, n)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution reads input directly from standard input, constructs the tree for each query, and uses DFS to find the maximum size of a good subtree. The results are printed for each query.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

We are given a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, which is a connected acyclic graph. For each query, we need to find the largest possible size of a "good" subtree. A subtree is considered "good" if it can be represented by segments on a line such that each segment corresponds to a vertex, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if their corresponding segments intersect.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. For a subtree to be "good", it must be possible to represent it with intersecting segments. This means that the subtree should be as large as possible while maintaining connectivity.

2. **Finding the Largest Good Subtree**: The largest good subtree will be the one that maximizes the number of intersecting segments. In a tree, the maximum number of intersecting segments is achieved by considering the entire tree minus one edge, which results in a subtree of size `n-1`.

3. **Reasoning**: Since a tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges, removing one edge will still leave a connected component with `n-1` vertices. This is the largest possible subtree that can be represented with intersecting segments.

### Pseudocode

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of queries `q`.
2. **Process Each Query**:
   - Read the number of vertices `n`.
   - For each query, the answer is `n-1` because removing one edge from the tree will give the largest possible connected component.
3. **Output**: For each query, output `n-1`.

Assume that you have $k$ one-dimensional segments $s_1, s_2, \dots s_k$ (each segment is denoted by two integers â€” its endpoints). Then you can build the following graph on these segments.

2. **Finding the Largest Good Subtree**: The largest good subtree will be the one that maximizes the number of intersecting segments. In a tree, the maximum number of intersecting segments is achieved by considering the entire tree minus one edge, which results in a subtree of size `n-1`.

3. **Reasoning**: Since a tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges, removing one edge will still leave a connected component with `n-1` vertices. This is the largest possible subtree that can be represented with intersecting segments.

### Pseudocode

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of queries `q`.
2. **Process Each Query**:
   - Read the number of vertices `n`.
   - For each query, the answer is `n-1` because removing one edge from the tree will give the largest possible connected component.
3. **Output**: For each query, output `n-1`.

### Python Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n - 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
- **Index Management**: We keep track of the current position in the input data using an index.
- **Query Processing**: For each query, we determine the number of vertices `n` and calculate the result as `n-1`, which is the size of the largest good subtree.
- **Output**: We collect all results and output them at once to minimize I/O operations.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` was defined but never called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be explicitly invoked to execute the logic and produce the output.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Function Invocation**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called after its definition. This is a common oversight when writing functions intended to handle input and output in a script-like manner.

2. **Re-evaluate Input Handling**: Double-check that the input is being read and processed correctly. The logic for skipping over the edges should be correct, but it's worth verifying that the index manipulation is accurate.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are being collected and output correctly. The use of `sys.stdout.write` should be correct, but it's important to confirm that the results list is populated as expected.

### Revised Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n - 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now explicitly called at the end of the script. This ensures that the logic within the function is executed, and the results are produced.
- **Input and Output**: The input is read in bulk, and the results are collected in a list. The results are then output using `sys.stdout.write`, which is efficient for large outputs.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now properly invoked.

- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Assume that you have $k$ one-dimensional segments $s_1, s_2, \dots s_k$ (each segment is denoted by two integers â€” its endpoints). Then you can build the following graph on these segments. The graph consists of $k$ vertexes, and there is an edge between the $i$-th and the $j$-th vertexes ($i \neq j$) if and only if the segments $s_i$ and $s_j$ intersect (there exists at least one point that belongs to both of them).

For example, if $s_1 = [1, 6], s_2 = [8, 20], s_3 = [4, 10], s_4 = [2, 13], s_5 = [17, 18]$, then the resulting graph is the following: [Image] 

A tree of size $m$ is good if it is possible to choose $m$ one-dimensional segments so that the graph built on these segments coincides with this tree.

You are given a tree, you have to find its good subtree with maximum possible size. Recall that a subtree is a connected subgraph of a tree.

Note that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 15 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of the queries. 

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree.

Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$) denoting an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer â€” the maximum size of a good subtree of the given tree.

1 4
2 5
2 6

-----Note-----

In the first query there is a good subtree of size $8$. The vertices belonging to this subtree are ${9, 4, 10, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3}$.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, there are several insights and takeaways:

    1. **Prefix Sum Efficiency**: My approach utilized a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of subarrays in constant time. This is a common technique in competitive programming to handle range sum queries efficiently, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, uses a direct summation approach within each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs due to its O(N) complexity per query.

    2. **Function Execution**: A key mistake in my initial solution was not calling the function that contained the main logic. This oversight led to no output being generated, which is a common pitfall when structuring code in functions without ensuring they are executed.

    3. **Input Handling**: Both my solution and the official solution handle input parsing effectively, but my approach used `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once, which is often more efficient in competitive programming settings where input size can be large.

    4. **Modulo Operation**: The official solution includes a modulo operation with `1000000000` during summation, which was not specified in the problem statement provided. This could be a requirement in some contexts to prevent overflow, but it was not necessary in the problem as I understood it.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient data structures like prefix sums for handling range queries and the necessity of ensuring that all parts of the code, especially function calls, are correctly implemented to produce the desired output.

2. **Re-evaluate Input Handling**: Double-check that the input is being read and processed correctly. The logic for skipping over the edges should be correct, but it's worth verifying that the index manipulation is accurate.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are being collected and output correctly. The use of `sys.stdout.write` should be correct, but it's important to confirm that the results list is populated as expected.

### Revised Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n - 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now explicitly called at the end of the script. This ensures that the logic within the function is executed, and the results are produced.
- **Input and Output**: The input is read in bulk, and the results are collected in a list. The results are then output using `sys.stdout.write`, which is efficient for large outputs.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now properly invoked.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code produced an output of `9` instead of the expected `8`. This suggests that the logic for determining the size of the largest "good" subtree is incorrect. Let's analyze the problem and the solution again:

### Problem Understanding

1. **Tree Structure**: A tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges. The task is to find the largest "good" subtree, which can be represented by intersecting segments.

2. **Good Subtree**: A "good" subtree is one where the segments corresponding to the vertices intersect. The largest such subtree is not necessarily `n-1` vertices, as previously assumed.

### Mistake in the Solution

- **Incorrect Assumption**: The assumption that the largest "good" subtree is always `n-1` vertices is incorrect. The problem requires finding a subtree that can be represented by intersecting segments, which may not always be the entire tree minus one edge.

### Correct Approach

1. **Tree Diameter**: The largest "good" subtree corresponds to the longest path in the tree, known as the diameter. The diameter of a tree is the longest path between any two vertices.

2. **Finding the Diameter**: To find the diameter, perform two breadth-first searches (BFS):
   - Start from any vertex and find the farthest vertex `A`.
   - From `A`, perform another BFS to find the farthest vertex `B`. The distance between `A` and `B` is the diameter.

3. **Result**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is the diameter plus one, as it includes all vertices along the longest path.

### Revised Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    from collections import deque
    
    def bfs(start, n, adj):
        visited = [-1] * (n + 1)
        queue = deque([start])
        visited[start] = 0
        farthest_node = start
        max_distance = 0
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if visited[neighbor] == -1:
                    visited[neighbor] = visited[node] + 1
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                    if visited[neighbor] > max_distance:
                        max_distance = visited[neighbor]
                        farthest_node = neighbor
        
        return farthest_node, max_distance
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            x = int(data[index])
            y = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            adj[x].append(y)
            adj[y].append(x)
        
        # Find the diameter of the tree
        farthest_node, _ = bfs(1, n, adj)
        _, diameter = bfs(farthest_node, n, adj)
        
        results.append(diameter + 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **BFS for Diameter**: The code now includes a BFS function to find the diameter of the tree.
- **Two BFS Calls**: The first BFS finds the farthest node from an arbitrary start node. The second BFS from this farthest node determines the diameter.
- **Result Calculation**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is the diameter plus one, as it includes all vertices along the longest path.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Assume that you have $k$ one-dimensional segments $s_1, s_2, \dots s_k$ (each segment is denoted by two integers â€” its endpoints). Then you can build the following graph on these segments. The graph consists of $k$ vertexes, and there is an edge between the $i$-th and the $j$-th vertexes ($i \neq j$) if and only if the segments $s_i$ and $s_j$ intersect (there exists at least one point that belongs to both of them).

For example, if $s_1 = [1, 6], s_2 = [8, 20], s_3 = [4, 10], s_4 = [2, 13], s_5 = [17, 18]$, then the resulting graph is the following: [Image] 

A tree of size $m$ is good if it is possible to choose $m$ one-dimensional segments so that the graph built on these segments coincides with this tree.

You are given a tree, you have to find its good subtree with maximum possible size. Recall that a subtree is a connected subgraph of a tree.

Note that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 15 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of the queries. 

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree.

Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$) denoting an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer â€” the maximum size of a good subtree of the given tree.


-----Example-----
Input
1
10
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
2 6
3 7
3 8
4 9
4 10

Output
8



-----Note-----

In the first query there is a good subtree of size $8$. The vertices belonging to this subtree are ${9, 4, 10, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3}$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, which is a connected acyclic graph. For each query, we need to find the largest possible size of a "good" subtree. A subtree is considered "good" if it can be represented by segments on a line such that each segment corresponds to a vertex, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if their corresponding segments intersect.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. For a subtree to be "good", it must be possible to represent it with intersecting segments. This means that the subtree should be as large as possible while maintaining connectivity.

2. **Finding the Largest Good Subtree**: The largest good subtree will be the one that maximizes the number of intersecting segments. In a tree, the maximum number of intersecting segments is achieved by considering the entire tree minus one edge, which results in a subtree of size `n-1`.

3. **Reasoning**: Since a tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges, removing one edge will still leave a connected component with `n-1` vertices. This is the largest possible subtree that can be represented with intersecting segments.

### Pseudocode

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of queries `q`.
2. **Process Each Query**:
   - Read the number of vertices `n`.
   - For each query, the answer is `n-1` because removing one edge from the tree will give the largest possible connected component.
3. **Output**: For each query, output `n-1`.

### Python Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n - 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
- **Index Management**: We keep track of the current position in the input data using an index.
- **Query Processing**: For each query, we determine the number of vertices `n` and calculate the result as `n-1`, which is the size of the largest good subtree.
- **Output**: We collect all results and output them at once to minimize I/O operations.

1. **Tree Structure**: A tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges. The task is to find the largest "good" subtree, which can be represented by intersecting segments.

### Correct Approach

1. **Tree Diameter**: The largest "good" subtree corresponds to the longest path in the tree, known as the diameter. The diameter of a tree is the longest path between any two vertices.

2. **Finding the Diameter**: To find the diameter, perform two breadth-first searches (BFS):
   - Start from any vertex and find the farthest vertex `A`.
   - From `A`, perform another BFS to find the farthest vertex `B`. The distance between `A` and `B` is the diameter.

3. **Result**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is the diameter plus one, as it includes all vertices along the longest path.

    \end{center}
    Note that there may be several maximum-length paths.
    In the above path, we could replace node 6 with node 5
    to obtain another path with length 4.

    Next we will discuss two $O(n)$ time algorithms
    for calculating the diameter of a tree.
    The first algorithm is based on dynamic programming,
    and the second algorithm uses two depth-first searches.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    A general way to approach many tree problems
    is to first root the tree arbitrarily.
    After this, we can try to solve the problem
    separately for each subtree.
    Our first algorithm for calculating the diameter
    is based on this idea.

    An important observation is that every path
    in a rooted tree has a \emph{highest point}:
    the highest node that belongs to the path.
    Thus, we can calculate for each node the length
    of the longest path whose highest point is the node.
    One of those paths corresponds to the diameter of the tree.

    For example, in the following tree,
    node 1 is the highest point on the path
    that corresponds to the diameter:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (-2,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (0,1) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (2,-1) {$7$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (-3,-1) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (7) at (-1,-1) {$6$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);

    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    We calculate for each node $x$ two values:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\texttt{toLeaf}(x)$: the maximum length of a path from $x$ to any leaf
    \item $\texttt{maxLength}(x)$: the maximum length of a path
    whose highest point is $x$
    \end{itemize}
    For example, in the above tree,
    $\texttt{toLeaf}(1)=2$, because there is a path
    $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 6$,
    and $\texttt{maxLength}(1)=4$,
    because there is a path
    $6 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 7$.
    In this case, $\texttt{maxLength}(1)$ equals the diameter.

    Dynamic programming can be used to calculate the above
    values for all nodes in $O(n)$ time.
    First, to calculate $\texttt{toLeaf}(x)$,
    we go through the children of $x$,
    choose a child $c$ with maximum $\texttt{toLeaf}(c)$
    and add one to this value.
    Then, to calculate $\texttt{maxLength}(x)$,
    we choose two distinct children $a$ and $b$
    such that the sum $\texttt{toLeaf}(a)+\texttt{toLeaf}(b)$
    is maximum and add two to this sum.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    Another efficient way to calculate the diameter
    of a tree is based on two depth-first searches.
    First, we choose an arbitrary node $a$ in the tree
    and find the farthest node $b$ from $a$.
    Then, we find the farthest node $c$ from $b$.
    The diameter of the tree is the distance between $b$ and $c$.

    In the following graph, $a$, $b$ and $c$ could be:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,3) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (0,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (2,1) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (4,1) {$7$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (-2,3) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (7) at (-2,1) {$6$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);
    \node[color=red] at (2,1.6) {$a$};
    \node[color=red] at (-2,1.6) {$b$};
    \node[color=red] at (4,1.6) {$c$};

    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    This is an elegant method, but why does it work?

    It helps to draw the tree differently so that
    the path that corresponds to the diameter
    is horizontal, and all other
    nodes hang from it:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (2,1) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (4,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (0,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (2,-1) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (6,1) {$7$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (0,-1) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (7) at (-2,1) {$6$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);
    \node[color=red] at (2,-1.6) {$a$};
    \node[color=red] at (-2,1.6) {$b$};
    \node[color=red] at (6,1.6) {$c$};
    \node[color=red] at (2,1.6) {$x$};

    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Node $x$ indicates the place where the path
    from node $a$ joins the path that corresponds
    to the diameter.
    The farthest node from $a$
    is node $b$, node $c$ or some other node
    that is at least as far from node $x$.
    Thus, this node is always a valid choice for
    an endpoint of a path that corresponds to the diameter.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Assume that you have $k$ one-dimensional segments $s_1, s_2, \dots s_k$ (each segment is denoted by two integers â€” its endpoints). Then you can build the following graph on these segments. The graph consists of $k$ vertexes, and there is an edge between the $i$-th and the $j$-th vertexes ($i \neq j$) if and only if the segments $s_i$ and $s_j$ intersect (there exists at least one point that belongs to both of them).

For example, if $s_1 = [1, 6], s_2 = [8, 20], s_3 = [4, 10], s_4 = [2, 13], s_5 = [17, 18]$, then the resulting graph is the following: [Image] 

A tree of size $m$ is good if it is possible to choose $m$ one-dimensional segments so that the graph built on these segments coincides with this tree.

You are given a tree, you have to find its good subtree with maximum possible size. Recall that a subtree is a connected subgraph of a tree.

Note that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 15 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of the queries. 

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree.

Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$) denoting an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer â€” the maximum size of a good subtree of the given tree.


-----Example-----
Input
1
10
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
2 6
3 7
3 8
4 9
4 10

Output
8



-----Note-----

In the first query there is a good subtree of size $8$. The vertices belonging to this subtree are ${9, 4, 10, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3}$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, which is a connected acyclic graph. For each query, we need to find the largest possible size of a "good" subtree. A subtree is considered "good" if it can be represented by segments on a line such that each segment corresponds to a vertex, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if their corresponding segments intersect.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. For a subtree to be "good", it must be possible to represent it with intersecting segments. This means that the subtree should be as large as possible while maintaining connectivity.

2. **Finding the Largest Good Subtree**: The largest good subtree will be the one that maximizes the number of intersecting segments. In a tree, the maximum number of intersecting segments is achieved by considering the entire tree minus one edge, which results in a subtree of size `n-1`.

3. **Reasoning**: Since a tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges, removing one edge will still leave a connected component with `n-1` vertices. This is the largest possible subtree that can be represented with intersecting segments.

### Pseudocode

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of queries `q`.
2. **Process Each Query**:
   - Read the number of vertices `n`.
   - For each query, the answer is `n-1` because removing one edge from the tree will give the largest possible connected component.
3. **Output**: For each query, output `n-1`.

### Python Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n - 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
- **Index Management**: We keep track of the current position in the input data using an index.
- **Query Processing**: For each query, we determine the number of vertices `n` and calculate the result as `n-1`, which is the size of the largest good subtree.
- **Output**: We collect all results and output them at once to minimize I/O operations.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` was defined but never called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be explicitly invoked to execute the logic and produce the output.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Function Invocation**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called after its definition. This is a common oversight when writing functions intended to handle input and output in a script-like manner.

2. **Re-evaluate Input Handling**: Double-check that the input is being read and processed correctly. The logic for skipping over the edges should be correct, but it's worth verifying that the index manipulation is accurate.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are being collected and output correctly. The use of `sys.stdout.write` should be correct, but it's important to confirm that the results list is populated as expected.

### Revised Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n - 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now explicitly called at the end of the script. This ensures that the logic within the function is executed, and the results are produced.
- **Input and Output**: The input is read in bulk, and the results are collected in a list. The results are then output using `sys.stdout.write`, which is efficient for large outputs.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now properly invoked.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code produced an output of `9` instead of the expected `8`. This suggests that the logic for determining the size of the largest "good" subtree is incorrect. Let's analyze the problem and the solution again:

### Problem Understanding

1. **Tree Structure**: A tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges. The task is to find the largest "good" subtree, which can be represented by intersecting segments.

2. **Good Subtree**: A "good" subtree is one where the segments corresponding to the vertices intersect. The largest such subtree is not necessarily `n-1` vertices, as previously assumed.

### Mistake in the Solution

- **Incorrect Assumption**: The assumption that the largest "good" subtree is always `n-1` vertices is incorrect. The problem requires finding a subtree that can be represented by intersecting segments, which may not always be the entire tree minus one edge.

### Correct Approach

1. **Tree Diameter**: The largest "good" subtree corresponds to the longest path in the tree, known as the diameter. The diameter of a tree is the longest path between any two vertices.

2. **Finding the Diameter**: To find the diameter, perform two breadth-first searches (BFS):
   - Start from any vertex and find the farthest vertex `A`.
   - From `A`, perform another BFS to find the farthest vertex `B`. The distance between `A` and `B` is the diameter.

3. **Result**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is the diameter plus one, as it includes all vertices along the longest path.

### Revised Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0

        queue = deque([start])
        visited[start] = 0
        farthest_node = start
        max_distance = 0

                    if visited[neighbor] > max_distance:
                        max_distance = visited[neighbor]
                        farthest_node = neighbor
        
        return farthest_node, max_distance

    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **BFS for Diameter**: The code now includes a BFS function to find the diameter of the tree.
- **Two BFS Calls**: The first BFS finds the farthest node from an arbitrary start node. The second BFS from this farthest node determines the diameter.
- **Result Calculation**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is the diameter plus one, as it includes all vertices along the longest path.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code produced an output of `5` instead of the expected `8`. This suggests that the logic for determining the size of the largest "good" subtree is still incorrect. Let's analyze the problem and the solution again:

### Problem Understanding

1. **Tree Structure**: A tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges. The task is to find the largest "good" subtree, which can be represented by intersecting segments.

2. **Good Subtree**: A "good" subtree is one where the segments corresponding to the vertices intersect. The largest such subtree is not necessarily the longest path (diameter) of the tree.

### Mistake in the Solution

- **Incorrect Assumption**: The assumption that the largest "good" subtree corresponds to the diameter of the tree is incorrect. The problem requires finding a subtree that can be represented by intersecting segments, which may not always be the longest path.

### Correct Approach

1. **Tree Properties**: In a tree, the largest "good" subtree is actually the entire tree itself. This is because any connected subtree of a tree can be represented by intersecting segments.

2. **Result**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is simply `n`, the number of vertices in the tree. This is because the entire tree can be represented as a "good" subtree.

### Revised Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1

        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Correct Result Calculation**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is simply `n`, the number of vertices in the tree. This is because the entire tree can be represented as a "good" subtree.
- **Simplified Logic**: The code now directly calculates the result as `n` for each query, as the entire tree is the largest "good" subtree.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Assume that you have $k$ one-dimensional segments $s_1, s_2, \dots s_k$ (each segment is denoted by two integers â€” its endpoints). Then you can build the following graph on these segments. The graph consists of $k$ vertexes, and there is an edge between the $i$-th and the $j$-th vertexes ($i \neq j$) if and only if the segments $s_i$ and $s_j$ intersect (there exists at least one point that belongs to both of them).

For example, if $s_1 = [1, 6], s_2 = [8, 20], s_3 = [4, 10], s_4 = [2, 13], s_5 = [17, 18]$, then the resulting graph is the following: [Image] 

A tree of size $m$ is good if it is possible to choose $m$ one-dimensional segments so that the graph built on these segments coincides with this tree.

You are given a tree, you have to find its good subtree with maximum possible size. Recall that a subtree is a connected subgraph of a tree.

Note that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 15 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of the queries. 

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree.

Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$) denoting an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer â€” the maximum size of a good subtree of the given tree.


-----Example-----
Input
1
10
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
2 6
3 7
3 8
4 9
4 10

Output
8



-----Note-----

In the first query there is a good subtree of size $8$. The vertices belonging to this subtree are ${9, 4, 10, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3}$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, which is a connected acyclic graph. For each query, we need to find the largest possible size of a "good" subtree. A subtree is considered "good" if it can be represented by segments on a line such that each segment corresponds to a vertex, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if their corresponding segments intersect.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. For a subtree to be "good", it must be possible to represent it with intersecting segments. This means that the subtree should be as large as possible while maintaining connectivity.

2. **Finding the Largest Good Subtree**: The largest good subtree will be the one that maximizes the number of intersecting segments. In a tree, the maximum number of intersecting segments is achieved by considering the entire tree minus one edge, which results in a subtree of size `n-1`.

3. **Reasoning**: Since a tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges, removing one edge will still leave a connected component with `n-1` vertices. This is the largest possible subtree that can be represented with intersecting segments.

### Pseudocode

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of queries `q`.
2. **Process Each Query**:
   - Read the number of vertices `n`.
   - For each query, the answer is `n-1` because removing one edge from the tree will give the largest possible connected component.
3. **Output**: For each query, output `n-1`.

### Python Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n - 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
- **Index Management**: We keep track of the current position in the input data using an index.
- **Query Processing**: For each query, we determine the number of vertices `n` and calculate the result as `n-1`, which is the size of the largest good subtree.
- **Output**: We collect all results and output them at once to minimize I/O operations.

   - From `A`, perform another BFS to find the farthest vertex `B`. The distance between `A` and `B` is the diameter.

3. **Result**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is the diameter plus one, as it includes all vertices along the longest path.

# Call the solve function to execute the logic

```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **BFS for Diameter**: The code now includes a BFS function to find the diameter of the tree.
- **Two BFS Calls**: The first BFS finds the farthest node from an arbitrary start node. The second BFS from this farthest node determines the diameter.
- **Result Calculation**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is the diameter plus one, as it includes all vertices along the longest path.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code produced an output of `5` instead of the expected `8`. This suggests that the logic for determining the size of the largest "good" subtree is still incorrect. Let's analyze the problem and the solution again:

### Problem Understanding

1. **Tree Structure**: A tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges. The task is to find the largest "good" subtree, which can be represented by intersecting segments.

2. **Good Subtree**: A "good" subtree is one where the segments corresponding to the vertices intersect. The largest such subtree is not necessarily the longest path (diameter) of the tree.

### Mistake in the Solution

- **Incorrect Assumption**: The assumption that the largest "good" subtree corresponds to the diameter of the tree is incorrect. The problem requires finding a subtree that can be represented by intersecting segments, which may not always be the longest path.

### Correct Approach

1. **Tree Properties**: In a tree, the largest "good" subtree is actually the entire tree itself. This is because any connected subtree of a tree can be represented by intersecting segments.

2. **Result**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is simply `n`, the number of vertices in the tree. This is because the entire tree can be represented as a "good" subtree.

### Revised Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Correct Result Calculation**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is simply `n`, the number of vertices in the tree. This is because the entire tree can be represented as a "good" subtree.
- **Simplified Logic**: The code now directly calculates the result as `n` for each query, as the entire tree is the largest "good" subtree.

Also, here are some of your memories.
Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Assume that you have $k$ one-dimensional segments $s_1, s_2, \dots s_k$ (each segment is denoted by two integers â€” its endpoints). Then you can build the following graph on these segments. The graph consists of $k$ vertexes, and there is an edge between the $i$-th and the $j$-th vertexes ($i \neq j$) if and only if the segments $s_i$ and $s_j$ intersect (there exists at least one point that belongs to both of them).

For example, if $s_1 = [1, 6], s_2 = [8, 20], s_3 = [4, 10], s_4 = [2, 13], s_5 = [17, 18]$, then the resulting graph is the following: [Image] 

A tree of size $m$ is good if it is possible to choose $m$ one-dimensional segments so that the graph built on these segments coincides with this tree.

You are given a tree, you have to find its good subtree with maximum possible size. Recall that a subtree is a connected subgraph of a tree.

Note that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 15 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of the queries. 

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree.

Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$) denoting an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer â€” the maximum size of a good subtree of the given tree.


-----Example-----
Input
1
10
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
2 6
3 7
3 8
4 9
4 10

Output
8



-----Note-----

In the first query there is a good subtree of size $8$. The vertices belonging to this subtree are ${9, 4, 10, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3}$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, which is a connected acyclic graph. For each query, we need to find the largest possible size of a "good" subtree. A subtree is considered "good" if it can be represented by segments on a line such that each segment corresponds to a vertex, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if their corresponding segments intersect.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. For a subtree to be "good", it must be possible to represent it with intersecting segments. This means that the subtree should be as large as possible while maintaining connectivity.

2. **Finding the Largest Good Subtree**: The largest good subtree will be the one that maximizes the number of intersecting segments. In a tree, the maximum number of intersecting segments is achieved by considering the entire tree minus one edge, which results in a subtree of size `n-1`.

3. **Reasoning**: Since a tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges, removing one edge will still leave a connected component with `n-1` vertices. This is the largest possible subtree that can be represented with intersecting segments.

### Pseudocode

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of queries `q`.
2. **Process Each Query**:
   - Read the number of vertices `n`.
   - For each query, the answer is `n-1` because removing one edge from the tree will give the largest possible connected component.
3. **Output**: For each query, output `n-1`.

### Python Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n - 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
- **Index Management**: We keep track of the current position in the input data using an index.
- **Query Processing**: For each query, we determine the number of vertices `n` and calculate the result as `n-1`, which is the size of the largest good subtree.
- **Output**: We collect all results and output them at once to minimize I/O operations.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` was defined but never called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be explicitly invoked to execute the logic and produce the output.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Function Invocation**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called after its definition. This is a common oversight when writing functions intended to handle input and output in a script-like manner.

2. **Re-evaluate Input Handling**: Double-check that the input is being read and processed correctly. The logic for skipping over the edges should be correct, but it's worth verifying that the index manipulation is accurate.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are being collected and output correctly. The use of `sys.stdout.write` should be correct, but it's important to confirm that the results list is populated as expected.

### Revised Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n - 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now explicitly called at the end of the script. This ensures that the logic within the function is executed, and the results are produced.
- **Input and Output**: The input is read in bulk, and the results are collected in a list. The results are then output using `sys.stdout.write`, which is efficient for large outputs.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now properly invoked.

2. **Good Subtree**: A "good" subtree is one where the segments corresponding to the vertices intersect. The largest such subtree is not necessarily `n-1` vertices, as previously assumed.

### Mistake in the Solution

- **Incorrect Assumption**: The assumption that the largest "good" subtree is always `n-1` vertices is incorrect. The problem requires finding a subtree that can be represented by intersecting segments, which may not always be the entire tree minus one edge.

### Correct Approach

1. **Tree Diameter**: The largest "good" subtree corresponds to the longest path in the tree, known as the diameter. The diameter of a tree is the longest path between any two vertices.

2. **Finding the Diameter**: To find the diameter, perform two breadth-first searches (BFS):
   - Start from any vertex and find the farthest vertex `A`.
   - From `A`, perform another BFS to find the farthest vertex `B`. The distance between `A` and `B` is the diameter.

3. **Result**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is the diameter plus one, as it includes all vertices along the longest path.

        visited = [-1] * (n + 1)
        queue = deque([start])
        visited[start] = 0
        farthest_node = start
        max_distance = 0

            node = queue.popleft()

                        farthest_node = neighbor
        
        return farthest_node, max_distance

            x = int(data[index])
            y = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2

        _, diameter = bfs(farthest_node, n, adj)

    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **BFS for Diameter**: The code now includes a BFS function to find the diameter of the tree.
- **Two BFS Calls**: The first BFS finds the farthest node from an arbitrary start node. The second BFS from this farthest node determines the diameter.
- **Result Calculation**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is the diameter plus one, as it includes all vertices along the longest path.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code produced an output of `5` instead of the expected `8`. This suggests that the logic for determining the size of the largest "good" subtree is still incorrect. Let's analyze the problem and the solution again:

### Problem Understanding

1. **Tree Structure**: A tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges. The task is to find the largest "good" subtree, which can be represented by intersecting segments.

2. **Good Subtree**: A "good" subtree is one where the segments corresponding to the vertices intersect. The largest such subtree is not necessarily the longest path (diameter) of the tree.

### Mistake in the Solution

- **Incorrect Assumption**: The assumption that the largest "good" subtree corresponds to the diameter of the tree is incorrect. The problem requires finding a subtree that can be represented by intersecting segments, which may not always be the longest path.

### Correct Approach

1. **Tree Properties**: In a tree, the largest "good" subtree is actually the entire tree itself. This is because any connected subtree of a tree can be represented by intersecting segments.

2. **Result**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is simply `n`, the number of vertices in the tree. This is because the entire tree can be represented as a "good" subtree.

### Revised Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Correct Result Calculation**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is simply `n`, the number of vertices in the tree. This is because the entire tree can be represented as a "good" subtree.
- **Simplified Logic**: The code now directly calculates the result as `n` for each query, as the entire tree is the largest "good" subtree.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find the largest "good" subtree in a given tree for multiple queries. Initially, I misunderstood the problem, thinking it was related to finding the longest path (diameter) of the tree. This led to incorrect assumptions and solutions.

The core concept here is understanding that a "good" subtree in the context of this problem is one that can be represented by intersecting segments. The key realization was that any connected subtree of a tree can be represented by intersecting segments, and thus the entire tree itself is the largest "good" subtree.

The initial strategy of calculating the tree's diameter was incorrect because it didn't align with the problem's requirements. The correct approach was to recognize that the entire tree, with all its vertices, is the largest "good" subtree. Therefore, the solution is simply the number of vertices `n` for each query.

The unexpected error was assuming the problem was about the tree's diameter, which led to incorrect outputs. The fix was to simplify the logic and directly output `n` for each query, as the entire tree is the largest "good" subtree. This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding problem requirements and constraints before diving into complex solutions.

- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Assume that you have $k$ one-dimensional segments $s_1, s_2, \dots s_k$ (each segment is denoted by two integers â€” its endpoints). Then you can build the following graph on these segments. The graph consists of $k$ vertexes, and there is an edge between the $i$-th and the $j$-th vertexes ($i \neq j$) if and only if the segments $s_i$ and $s_j$ intersect (there exists at least one point that belongs to both of them).

For example, if $s_1 = [1, 6], s_2 = [8, 20], s_3 = [4, 10], s_4 = [2, 13], s_5 = [17, 18]$, then the resulting graph is the following: [Image] 

A tree of size $m$ is good if it is possible to choose $m$ one-dimensional segments so that the graph built on these segments coincides with this tree.

You are given a tree, you have to find its good subtree with maximum possible size. Recall that a subtree is a connected subgraph of a tree.

Note that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 15 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of the queries. 

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree.

Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$) denoting an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer â€” the maximum size of a good subtree of the given tree.


-----Example-----
Input
1
10
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 5
2 6
3 7
3 8
4 9
4 10

Output
8



-----Note-----

In the first query there is a good subtree of size $8$. The vertices belonging to this subtree are ${9, 4, 10, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3}$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, which is a connected acyclic graph. For each query, we need to find the largest possible size of a "good" subtree. A subtree is considered "good" if it can be represented by segments on a line such that each segment corresponds to a vertex, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if their corresponding segments intersect.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. For a subtree to be "good", it must be possible to represent it with intersecting segments. This means that the subtree should be as large as possible while maintaining connectivity.

2. **Finding the Largest Good Subtree**: The largest good subtree will be the one that maximizes the number of intersecting segments. In a tree, the maximum number of intersecting segments is achieved by considering the entire tree minus one edge, which results in a subtree of size `n-1`.

3. **Reasoning**: Since a tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges, removing one edge will still leave a connected component with `n-1` vertices. This is the largest possible subtree that can be represented with intersecting segments.

### Pseudocode

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of queries `q`.
2. **Process Each Query**:
   - Read the number of vertices `n`.
   - For each query, the answer is `n-1` because removing one edge from the tree will give the largest possible connected component.
3. **Output**: For each query, output `n-1`.

### Python Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n - 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
- **Index Management**: We keep track of the current position in the input data using an index.
- **Query Processing**: For each query, we determine the number of vertices `n` and calculate the result as `n-1`, which is the size of the largest good subtree.
- **Output**: We collect all results and output them at once to minimize I/O operations.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve()` was defined but never called. In competitive programming environments, the function needs to be explicitly invoked to execute the logic and produce the output.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Function Invocation**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called after its definition. This is a common oversight when writing functions intended to handle input and output in a script-like manner.

2. **Re-evaluate Input Handling**: Double-check that the input is being read and processed correctly. The logic for skipping over the edges should be correct, but it's worth verifying that the index manipulation is accurate.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the results are being collected and output correctly. The use of `sys.stdout.write` should be correct, but it's important to confirm that the results list is populated as expected.

### Revised Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n - 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now explicitly called at the end of the script. This ensures that the logic within the function is executed, and the results are produced.
- **Input and Output**: The input is read in bulk, and the results are collected in a list. The results are then output using `sys.stdout.write`, which is efficient for large outputs.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now properly invoked.

The feedback indicates that the code produced an output of `9` instead of the expected `8`. This suggests that the logic for determining the size of the largest "good" subtree is incorrect. Let's analyze the problem and the solution again:

### Problem Understanding

1. **Tree Structure**: A tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges. The task is to find the largest "good" subtree, which can be represented by intersecting segments.

2. **Good Subtree**: A "good" subtree is one where the segments corresponding to the vertices intersect. The largest such subtree is not necessarily `n-1` vertices, as previously assumed.

### Mistake in the Solution

- **Incorrect Assumption**: The assumption that the largest "good" subtree is always `n-1` vertices is incorrect. The problem requires finding a subtree that can be represented by intersecting segments, which may not always be the entire tree minus one edge.

### Correct Approach

1. **Tree Diameter**: The largest "good" subtree corresponds to the longest path in the tree, known as the diameter. The diameter of a tree is the longest path between any two vertices.

2. **Finding the Diameter**: To find the diameter, perform two breadth-first searches (BFS):
   - Start from any vertex and find the farthest vertex `A`.
   - From `A`, perform another BFS to find the farthest vertex `B`. The distance between `A` and `B` is the diameter.

3. **Result**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is the diameter plus one, as it includes all vertices along the longest path.

        results.append(diameter + 1)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **BFS for Diameter**: The code now includes a BFS function to find the diameter of the tree.
- **Two BFS Calls**: The first BFS finds the farthest node from an arbitrary start node. The second BFS from this farthest node determines the diameter.
- **Result Calculation**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is the diameter plus one, as it includes all vertices along the longest path.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code produced an output of `5` instead of the expected `8`. This suggests that the logic for determining the size of the largest "good" subtree is still incorrect. Let's analyze the problem and the solution again:

### Problem Understanding

1. **Tree Structure**: A tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges. The task is to find the largest "good" subtree, which can be represented by intersecting segments.

2. **Good Subtree**: A "good" subtree is one where the segments corresponding to the vertices intersect. The largest such subtree is not necessarily the longest path (diameter) of the tree.

### Mistake in the Solution

- **Incorrect Assumption**: The assumption that the largest "good" subtree corresponds to the diameter of the tree is incorrect. The problem requires finding a subtree that can be represented by intersecting segments, which may not always be the longest path.

### Correct Approach

1. **Tree Properties**: In a tree, the largest "good" subtree is actually the entire tree itself. This is because any connected subtree of a tree can be represented by intersecting segments.

2. **Result**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is simply `n`, the number of vertices in the tree. This is because the entire tree can be represented as a "good" subtree.

### Revised Code

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    q = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(q):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed
        results.append(n)
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- **Correct Result Calculation**: The size of the largest "good" subtree is simply `n`, the number of vertices in the tree. This is because the entire tree can be represented as a "good" subtree.
- **Simplified Logic**: The code now directly calculates the result as `n` for each query, as the entire tree is the largest "good" subtree.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 119 [generation text] Reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I initially misunderstood the requirements for determining the largest "good" subtree. My initial approach incorrectly assumed that the largest "good" subtree was simply the entire tree or its diameter, which led to incorrect outputs.

The official solution provides a more nuanced approach by considering the degrees of the nodes and using a depth-first search (DFS) strategy to calculate the maximum distance in the tree. This approach effectively finds the longest path in the tree, which corresponds to the largest "good" subtree.

Key insights from the official solution include:

1. **Graph Representation**: The tree is represented using an adjacency list, which is efficient for traversing and exploring the tree structure.

2. **Degree Calculation**: The degree of each node is calculated, and a point value (`pnt`) is assigned to each node based on its degree. This helps in determining the potential of each node to contribute to the longest path.

3. **Two-Pass DFS**: The solution uses a two-pass DFS approach:
   - The first pass starts from an arbitrary root and finds the farthest node.
   - The second pass starts from this farthest node to find the maximum distance, which represents the longest path in the tree.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution ensures that even nodes with a degree of 1 (leaf nodes) are considered by using `max(deg[i]-1,1)` to ensure they contribute to the path calculation.

This approach is insightful as it leverages the properties of tree structures and efficiently calculates the longest path using DFS, which is more aligned with the problem's requirements than my initial assumptions.
