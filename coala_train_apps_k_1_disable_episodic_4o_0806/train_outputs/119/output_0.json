    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, which is a connected acyclic graph. For each query, we need to find the largest possible size of a \"good\" subtree. A subtree is considered \"good\" if it can be represented by segments on a line such that each segment corresponds to a vertex, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if their corresponding segments intersect.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. For a subtree to be \"good\", it must be possible to represent it with intersecting segments. This means that the subtree should be as large as possible while maintaining connectivity.\n\n2. **Finding the Largest Good Subtree**: The largest good subtree will be the one that maximizes the number of intersecting segments. In a tree, the maximum number of intersecting segments is achieved by considering the entire tree minus one edge, which results in a subtree of size `n-1`.\n\n3. **Reasoning**: Since a tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges, removing one edge will still leave a connected component with `n-1` vertices. This is the largest possible subtree that can be represented with intersecting segments.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of queries `q`.\n2. **Process Each Query**:\n   - Read the number of vertices `n`.\n   - For each query, the answer is `n-1` because removing one edge from the tree will give the largest possible connected component.\n3. **Output**: For each query, output `n-1`.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    q = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(q):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1 + (n - 1) * 2  # Skip the edges as they are not needed\n        results.append(n - 1)\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)) + \"\\n\")\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Index Management**: We keep track of the current position in the input data using an index.\n- **Query Processing**: For each query, we determine the number of vertices `n` and calculate the result as `n-1`, which is the size of the largest good subtree.\n- **Output**: We collect all results and output them at once to minimize I/O operations.",
