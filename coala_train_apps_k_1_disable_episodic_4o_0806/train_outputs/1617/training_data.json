    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to convert a number into a specified base, with the default being \u03c0. The challenge was to handle both integer and fractional parts of the number and return the result as a string. The function needed to accommodate non-integer bases, which added complexity to the conversion process.\n\n### Core Concepts:\n- **Base Conversion**: The problem required converting numbers to bases that could be non-integer, such as \u03c0. This involves handling both integer and fractional parts separately.\n- **Handling Non-Integer Bases**: Unlike typical base conversions, non-integer bases require careful handling of division and modulus operations.\n\n### Strategies and Challenges:\n- **Integer Part Conversion**: Initially, the conversion logic for the integer part was not correctly handling non-integer bases. The use of integer division and modulus operations needed to be adapted for non-integer bases.\n- **Fractional Part Conversion**: Multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting digits worked well, but ensuring precision with the specified number of decimal places was crucial.\n\n### Errors and Fixes:\n- **Incorrect Integer Conversion**: The main issue was with the integer part conversion when using non-integer bases. Adjusting the logic to correctly handle division and modulus operations for non-integer bases was key.\n- **Zero Handling**: Ensuring that the integer part is represented as '0' when necessary was a simple but important fix.\n\n### Final Solution:\nThe final solution involved correctly adapting the conversion logic for non-integer bases and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts were handled accurately. The function now correctly converts numbers to the specified base, including non-integer bases like \u03c0, and formats the result as expected.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Handling Non-Integer Bases:**\n   - The official solution effectively handles non-integer bases by using logarithms to determine the maximum power of the base needed to represent the integer part of the number. This approach is more mathematically robust than iteratively dividing by the base, especially when the base is non-integer.\n\n2. **Efficient Conversion:**\n   - The use of `log(n, base)` to determine the highest power of the base needed is a clever way to start the conversion process. It ensures that the conversion loop only iterates over the necessary powers of the base, making the solution efficient.\n\n3. **Handling Negative Numbers:**\n   - The official solution handles negative numbers by prepending a '-' sign if the number is negative. This is a straightforward and effective way to manage sign without complicating the conversion logic.\n\n4. **Decimal Handling:**\n   - The solution uses a loop that iterates over both positive and negative powers of the base, seamlessly handling both the integer and fractional parts of the number. This unified approach simplifies the code and ensures consistency in handling different parts of the number.\n\n5. **String Construction:**\n   - The use of a list to accumulate characters and then joining them into a final string is efficient and avoids the overhead of string concatenation in a loop.\n\nOverall, the official solution is insightful in its use of mathematical properties (like logarithms) to simplify and optimize the conversion process. It provides a clear and efficient way to handle both integer and fractional parts of a number in any base, including non-integer bases like \u03c0. This approach is a valuable lesson in leveraging mathematical insights to solve computational problems effectively.",
