INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a game scenario with `N` sabotages, each initially at level 0. There are also `N` imposters, each with a specific task. The `i-th` imposter will increase the level of the `x-th` sabotage by 1 if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `x` is equal to `i`. After all imposters have completed their tasks, we need to determine how many sabotages have reached level 5.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the GCD Condition**: The condition `gcd(i, x) = i` implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. This means that for each imposter `i`, they will increase the level of all sabotages that are multiples of `i`.

2. **Level Calculation**: For a given sabotage `x`, its level will be increased by every imposter `i` that is a divisor of `x`. Therefore, the level of a sabotage `x` is equal to the number of divisors of `x`.

3. **Counting Level 5 Sabotages**: We need to count how many numbers from 1 to `N` have exactly 5 divisors. This is equivalent to counting numbers that have exactly 5 divisors.

4. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the constraints, directly iterating over all numbers up to `N` is not feasible. Instead, we need a mathematical insight:
   - A number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. This is because the divisors of `p^4` are `1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4`.

5. **Prime Calculation**: We need to find all prime numbers `p` such that `p^4 <= N`.

## Pseudocode

1. For each test case:
   - Read `N`.
   - Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
   - For each integer `p` starting from 2:
     - If `p^4 > N`, break the loop.
     - Check if `p` is a prime number.
     - If `p` is prime, increment `count`.
   - Output `count`.

## Python Solution

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
    count = 0
    p = 2
    while p**4 <= N:
        if is_prime(p):
            count += 1
        p += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        results.append(count_sabotages_at_level_5(N))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution efficiently calculates the number of sabotages at level 5 by leveraging the mathematical property that a number with exactly 5 divisors must be of the form `p^4`, where `p` is a prime number. The function `is_prime` is used to check the primality of numbers, and the main function handles input and output.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, with constraints on consecutive days and the first and last day. The key pattern is recognizing that for \( N > 3 \), the number of valid schedules can be expressed using a formula involving powers of 3, due to the constraints on dish selection.

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the strategy was to use a straightforward formula: \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \). The use of fast exponentiation with the `pow` function was correct, but the application of the modulo operation needed careful attention. The error was in not correctly applying the modulo operation to the entire expression, which led to incorrect results for larger values of \( N \).

    #### Fixes and Insights
    The solution was fixed by ensuring that the modulo operation was applied to the entire calculation, especially when dealing with large powers. The `pow` function was used to efficiently compute \( 3^{(N-2)} \mod (10^9 + 7) \). This experience reinforced the importance of correctly applying modulo operations in problems involving large numbers and exponentiation.

    #### Final Correct Code
    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return (4 * 3) % MOD
        elif N == 3:
            return (4 * 3 * 2) % MOD
        else:
            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)
            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    main()
    ```

    This code correctly computes the number of valid schedules for each test case, taking into account the constraints and using modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

3. **Divisor Count**: A number `x` has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. This is because the divisors of `p^4` are `1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4`.

4. **Prime Calculation**: We need to count the number of primes `p` such that `p^4 <= N`.

### Pseudocode

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. **For each test case**:
   - Read `N`.
   - Initialize a counter for primes `count = 0`.
   - For each integer `p` starting from 2:
     - If `p^4 > N`, break the loop.
     - Check if `p` is a prime.
     - If `p` is prime, increment `count`.
   - Output `count`.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] In this problem, the key concept was understanding how the level of sabotages is determined by the number of divisors a number has. Specifically, a sabotage reaches level 5 if it has exactly 5 divisors, which occurs when the number is of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. This insight was crucial for solving the problem efficiently given the constraints.

The strategy involved iterating over potential prime numbers `p` and checking if `p^4` is less than or equal to `N`. For each prime `p` that satisfies this condition, we increment a counter. This approach efficiently counts the number of sabotages that reach level 5 without directly simulating the entire process for large `N`.

The implementation required a helper function to check for primality, which was done using trial division up to the square root of the number. This method is efficient enough given the constraints, as the number of primes to check is relatively small due to the `p^4` condition.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties, such as divisors and prime numbers, and how they can be leveraged to solve problems efficiently without brute force.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a game scenario with `N` sabotages, each initially at level 0. There are also `N` imposters, each tasked with upgrading the level of sabotages. The `i-th` imposter will increase the level of the `x-th` sabotage by one if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `i` and `x` is equal to `i`. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have completed their tasks.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the GCD Condition**: The condition `gcd(i, x) = i` implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`. Therefore, for each imposter `i`, they will increase the level of all sabotages `x` that are multiples of `i`.

2. **Level Calculation**: For a sabotage `x`, its level will be increased by the number of divisors it has. We need to find out how many sabotages have exactly 5 divisors.

3. **Divisor Count**: A number `x` has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form `p^4` where `p` is a prime number. This is because the divisors of `p^4` are `1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4`.

4. **Prime Calculation**: We need to count the number of primes `p` such that `p^4 <= N`.

### Pseudocode

1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. **For each test case**:
   - Read `N`.
   - Initialize a counter for primes `count = 0`.
   - For each integer `p` starting from 2:
     - If `p^4 > N`, break the loop.
     - Check if `p` is a prime.
     - If `p` is prime, increment `count`.
   - Output `count`.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem required determining how many sabotages reach level 5, which translates to finding numbers with exactly 5 divisors. The key insight is that a number with exactly 5 divisors must be of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. This is because the divisors of \( p^4 \) are \( 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4 \).

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Prime Sieve for Efficiency**: The official solution uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently generate a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit. This is more efficient than checking each number for primality individually, especially when dealing with large numbers.

2. **Precomputation**: The solution precomputes \( p^4 \) for each prime \( p \) and stores these values in a list. This allows for quick lookups using binary search (via the `bisect` module) to determine how many such values are less than or equal to \( N \).

3. **Binary Search for Fast Queries**: By precomputing the fourth powers of primes and storing them in a sorted list, the solution can quickly determine the count of numbers \( p^4 \leq N \) using binary search. This is efficient and scales well with large inputs.

#### Comparison with My Approach:

- **Efficiency**: The official solution is more efficient due to the use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes and binary search. My approach involved checking each number for primality and iterating over potential primes, which is less efficient for large inputs.
  
- **Scalability**: The precomputation and use of binary search in the official solution make it well-suited for handling the upper constraint of \( N \leq 10^{18} \).

#### Conclusion:

The official solution is a great example of leveraging mathematical properties (number of divisors) and algorithmic techniques (sieve and binary search) to solve a problem efficiently. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large constraints, as it minimizes the computational overhead during query processing.
