## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, each defined by two integers [Li, Ri]. He wants to transform the first segment into the last segment by performing a series of operations on the segments in sequence. The operations allowed are shifting the left or right border of a segment by one unit, either increasing or decreasing it. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: 
   - You can increase or decrease the left or right border of a segment.
   - You cannot make a segment empty (i.e., L should never equal R).

2. **Transformation Process**:
   - For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment.
   - Calculate the difference in the left and right borders between the current and next segment.
   - Use the minimal number of operations to adjust the borders to match the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest one. The order of operations is: L+, L-, R+, R-.

4. **Iterate Over Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, read the number of segments and the segments themselves.
   - For each segment, compute the operations needed to transform it into the next segment.
   - Accumulate the operations and count them.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the total number of operations and the sequence of operations.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        operations = []
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            while current_segment != next_segment:
                if current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                    operations.append("L+")
                    current_segment.L += 1
                elif current_segment.L > next_segment.L:
                    operations.append("L-")
                    current_segment.L -= 1
                elif current_segment.R < next_segment.R:
                    operations.append("R+")
                    current_segment.R += 1
                elif current_segment.R > next_segment.R:
                    operations.append("R-")
                    current_segment.R -= 1
        print number of operations
        print operations as a string
```

### Python Code

```python
def transform_segments(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, segments = test_case
        operations = []
        
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_L, current_R = segments[i]
            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Transform current segment to the next segment
            while current_L != next_L or current_R != next_R:
                if current_L < next_L:
                    operations.append("L+")
                    current_L += 1
                elif current_L > next_L:
                    operations.append("L-")
                    current_L -= 1
                elif current_R < next_R:
                    operations.append("R+")
                    current_R += 1
                elif current_R > next_R:
                    operations.append("R-")
                    current_R -= 1
        
        results.append((len(operations), ''.join(operations)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result[0])
        print(result[1])

# Example usage:
# T = 4
# test_cases = [
#     (3, [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (3, 5)]),
#     (1, [(0, 1)]),
#     (3, [(-2, -1), (-2, -1), (-2, 0)]),
#     (4, [(4, 6), (3, 5), (-1, 1), (1, 2)])
# ]
# transform_segments(T, test_cases)
```

This code reads the number of test cases and segments, then iteratively transforms each segment to the next one using the minimal number of operations, while ensuring the operations are lexicographically minimal. The results are printed for each test case.

-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to manipulate a sequence of integers to achieve a sum of zero using a specific operation. The operation allowed us to decrease an element at index `i` by `i`, which effectively means we can reduce the sum of the sequence by any combination of the first `N` natural numbers.

    The key insight was recognizing that the sum of the sequence can be adjusted by any integer from `0` to `N * (N + 1) / 2`. This allowed us to determine if the initial sum `S` of the sequence could be reduced to zero. If `S` was within this range, it was possible to make the sequence "good"; otherwise, it was not.

    The solution involved calculating the initial sum of the sequence and checking if it fell within the feasible range of reductions. This approach was efficient given the constraints, as `N` was small (up to 10), allowing us to perform these calculations quickly even for the maximum number of test cases.

    The implementation was straightforward, involving reading input, calculating the sum, and checking the feasibility condition for each test case. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness of the approach.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: We can perform four types of operations on a segment [L, R]:
   - Increase L by 1 (L+)
   - Decrease L by 1 (L-)
   - Increase R by 1 (R+)
   - Decrease R by 1 (R-)

2. **Transformation Process**: For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment until the last one is reached. This involves:
   - Adjusting the left border (L) of the current segment to match the left border of the next segment.
   - Adjusting the right border (R) of the current segment to match the right border of the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest operation. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: L-, L+, R-, R+.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: For each test case, iterate through the segments and apply the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        initialize total_operations = 0
        initialize operations_sequence = ""
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                perform L+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.L > next_segment.L:
                perform L- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L-" to operations_sequence
            
            # Transform R
            while current_segment.R < next_segment.R:
                perform R+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R+" to operations_sequence

                append "R-" to operations_sequence

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:

-1 0
0 1

1
0 1

-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: We can perform four types of operations on a segment [L, R]:
   - Increase L by 1 (L+)
   - Decrease L by 1 (L-)
   - Increase R by 1 (R+)
   - Decrease R by 1 (R-)

2. **Transformation Process**: For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment until the last one is reached. This involves:
   - Adjusting the left border (L) of the current segment to match the left border of the next segment.
   - Adjusting the right border (R) of the current segment to match the right border of the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest operation. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: L-, L+, R-, R+.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: For each test case, iterate through the segments and apply the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        initialize total_operations = 0
        initialize operations_sequence = ""
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                perform L+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.L > next_segment.L:
                perform L- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L-" to operations_sequence
            
            # Transform R
            while current_segment.R < next_segment.R:
                perform R+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.R > next_segment.R:
                perform R- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R-" to operations_sequence
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest sequence should be chosen.

### Identifying the Issue

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The operations should be applied in a specific order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically smallest. The order should be: L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted correctly, with each test case's result printed on separate lines.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Order of Operations**: The code did not correctly prioritize operations in the lexicographical order. The operations were applied in the order of L+, L-, R+, R-, which is incorrect.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output for the second test case was an empty string, which indicates a possible issue with how results are stored or printed.

### Correcting the Solution

1. **Adjust the Order of Operations**: Ensure that operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order: L-, L+, R-, R+.

2. **Ensure Correct Output**: Make sure that the results are stored and printed correctly for each test case.

### Revised Solution

```python
def transform_segments(test_cases):
    results = []
    for segments in test_cases:
        N = len(segments)
        total_operations = 0
        operations_sequence = []
        
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_L, current_R = segments[i]
            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_L > next_L:
                current_L -= 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L-")
            while current_L < next_L:
                current_L += 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L+")
            
            # Transform R
            while current_R > next_R:
                current_R -= 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("R-")
            while current_R < next_R:
                current_R += 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("R+")
        
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Example usage:
# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
index = 0
T = int(data[index])
index += 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    segments = []
    for _ in range(N):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append(segments)

# Solve the problem
transform_segments(test_cases)
```

This revised solution ensures that operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order and that the output is formatted correctly for each test case.

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1
1 2

Output:
9
R+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+
0

1
R+
13
L-R-L-L-L-L-R-R-R-R-L+R+L+

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: We can perform four types of operations on a segment [L, R]:
   - Increase L by 1 (L+)
   - Decrease L by 1 (L-)
   - Increase R by 1 (R+)
   - Decrease R by 1 (R-)

2. **Transformation Process**: For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment until the last one is reached. This involves:
   - Adjusting the left border (L) of the current segment to match the left border of the next segment.
   - Adjusting the right border (R) of the current segment to match the right border of the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest operation. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: L-, L+, R-, R+.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: For each test case, iterate through the segments and apply the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        initialize total_operations = 0
        initialize operations_sequence = ""
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                perform L+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.L > next_segment.L:
                perform L- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L-" to operations_sequence
            
            # Transform R
            while current_segment.R < next_segment.R:
                perform R+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.R > next_segment.R:
                perform R- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R-" to operations_sequence
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def transform_segments(test_cases):
    results = []

        N = len(segments)

            # Transform L

                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L-")

                operations_sequence.append("R-")
        
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Example usage:
# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
index = 0
T = int(data[index])

test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    segments = []
    for _ in range(N):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append(segments)

# Solve the problem
transform_segments(test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the minimal number of operations and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to transform the first segment into the last one.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest sequence should be chosen.

### Identifying the Issue

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The operations should be applied in a specific order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically smallest. The order should be: L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted correctly, with each test case's result printed on separate lines.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Order of Operations**: The code did not correctly prioritize operations in the lexicographical order. The operations were applied in the order of L+, L-, R+, R-, which is incorrect.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output for the second test case was an empty string, which indicates a possible issue with how results are stored or printed.

### Correcting the Solution

1. **Adjust the Order of Operations**: Ensure that operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order: L-, L+, R-, R+.

2. **Ensure Correct Output**: Make sure that the results are stored and printed correctly for each test case.

### Revised Solution

```python
def transform_segments(test_cases):
    results = []
    for segments in test_cases:
        N = len(segments)
        total_operations = 0
        operations_sequence = []
        
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_L, current_R = segments[i]
            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_L > next_L:
                current_L -= 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L-")
            while current_L < next_L:
                current_L += 1
                total_operations += 1

                operations_sequence.append("R+")
        
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Example usage:

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing at most one operation of removing a character from any position in the string and inserting it back at any other position. The challenge was to ensure that the solution explored all possible single-character moves to achieve the smallest lexicographical order.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Lexicographical Order**: Understanding how to compare strings based on dictionary order was crucial.
    - **String Manipulation**: The problem required generating new strings by removing and reinserting characters, which involved careful handling of string slicing and concatenation.

    ### Strategies:
    - Initially, the approach was to move the smallest character to the front, which worked for some cases but not all. This strategy was too simplistic and didn't account for all possible rearrangements.
    - The successful strategy involved iterating over all characters, removing each one, and trying to find the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character. The initial approach was to move the smallest character to the front, but this was insufficient for all cases. The correct approach involved iterating over all possible single-character moves, generating new strings, and comparing them to find the smallest lexicographical order. This approach ensures that all potential rearrangements are considered, leading to the correct solution. The key takeaway is to consider all possible operations when the problem allows for a single move, as the optimal solution might not be immediately obvious.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1
1 2

Output:

R+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+
0

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: We can perform four types of operations on a segment [L, R]:
   - Increase L by 1 (L+)
   - Decrease L by 1 (L-)
   - Increase R by 1 (R+)
   - Decrease R by 1 (R-)

2. **Transformation Process**: For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment until the last one is reached. This involves:
   - Adjusting the left border (L) of the current segment to match the left border of the next segment.
   - Adjusting the right border (R) of the current segment to match the right border of the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest operation. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: L-, L+, R-, R+.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: For each test case, iterate through the segments and apply the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        initialize total_operations = 0
        initialize operations_sequence = ""
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                perform L+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.L > next_segment.L:
                perform L- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L-" to operations_sequence
            
            # Transform R
            while current_segment.R < next_segment.R:
                perform R+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.R > next_segment.R:
                perform R- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R-" to operations_sequence
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def transform_segments(test_cases):
    results = []
    for segments in test_cases:
        N = len(segments)
        total_operations = 0
        operations_sequence = []
        
        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_L, current_R = segments[i]
            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_L < next_L:
                current_L += 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L+")
            while current_L > next_L:
                current_L -= 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L-")
            
            # Transform R
            while current_R < next_R:
                current_R += 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("R+")
            while current_R > next_R:
                current_R -= 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("R-")
        
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Example usage:
# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
index = 0
T = int(data[index])
index += 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    segments = []
    for _ in range(N):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append(segments)

# Solve the problem
transform_segments(test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the minimal number of operations and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to transform the first segment into the last one.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest sequence should be chosen.

### Identifying the Issue

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The operations should be applied in a specific order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically smallest. The order should be: L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted correctly, with each test case's result printed on separate lines.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Order of Operations**: The code did not correctly prioritize operations in the lexicographical order. The operations were applied in the order of L+, L-, R+, R-, which is incorrect.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output for the second test case was an empty string, which indicates a possible issue with how results are stored or printed.

### Correcting the Solution

1. **Adjust the Order of Operations**: Ensure that operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order: L-, L+, R-, R+.

2. **Ensure Correct Output**: Make sure that the results are stored and printed correctly for each test case.

### Revised Solution

def transform_segments(test_cases):

            # Transform L
            while current_L > next_L:
                current_L -= 1

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1

Output:

R+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: We can perform four types of operations on a segment [L, R]:
   - Increase L by 1 (L+)
   - Decrease L by 1 (L-)
   - Increase R by 1 (R+)
   - Decrease R by 1 (R-)

2. **Transformation Process**: For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment until the last one is reached. This involves:
   - Adjusting the left border (L) of the current segment to match the left border of the next segment.
   - Adjusting the right border (R) of the current segment to match the right border of the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest operation. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: L-, L+, R-, R+.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: For each test case, iterate through the segments and apply the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        initialize total_operations = 0
        initialize operations_sequence = ""
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                perform L+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.L > next_segment.L:
                perform L- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L-" to operations_sequence
            
            # Transform R
            while current_segment.R < next_segment.R:
                perform R+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.R > next_segment.R:
                perform R- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R-" to operations_sequence
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def transform_segments(test_cases):
    results = []
    for segments in test_cases:
        N = len(segments)
        total_operations = 0

        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_L, current_R = segments[i]
            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_L < next_L:
                current_L += 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L+")
            while current_L > next_L:
                current_L -= 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L-")
            
            # Transform R
            while current_R < next_R:
                current_R += 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("R+")
            while current_R > next_R:
                current_R -= 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("R-")
        
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Example usage:
# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
index = 0
T = int(data[index])
index += 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    segments = []
    for _ in range(N):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append(segments)

# Solve the problem
transform_segments(test_cases)
```

This solution reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the minimal number of operations and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to transform the first segment into the last one.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest sequence should be chosen.

### Identifying the Issue

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The operations should be applied in a specific order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically smallest. The order should be: L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted correctly, with each test case's result printed on separate lines.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Order of Operations**: The code did not correctly prioritize operations in the lexicographical order. The operations were applied in the order of L+, L-, R+, R-, which is incorrect.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output for the second test case was an empty string, which indicates a possible issue with how results are stored or printed.

### Correcting the Solution

1. **Adjust the Order of Operations**: Ensure that operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order: L-, L+, R-, R+.

2. **Ensure Correct Output**: Make sure that the results are stored and printed correctly for each test case.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing at most one operation of removing a character from any position in the string and inserting it back at any other position. The challenge was to ensure that the solution explored all possible single-character moves to achieve the smallest lexicographical order.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Lexicographical Order**: Understanding how to compare strings based on dictionary order was crucial.
    - **String Manipulation**: The problem required generating new strings by removing and reinserting characters, which involved careful handling of string slicing and concatenation.

    ### Strategies:
    - Initially, the approach was to move the smallest character to the front, which worked for some cases but not all. This strategy was too simplistic and didn't account for all possible rearrangements.
    - The successful strategy involved iterating over all characters, removing each one, and trying to find the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character. The initial approach was to move the smallest character to the front, but this was insufficient for all cases. The correct approach involved iterating over all possible single-character moves, generating new strings, and comparing them to find the smallest lexicographical order. This approach ensures that all potential rearrangements are considered, leading to the correct solution. The key takeaway is to consider all possible operations when the problem allows for a single move, as the optimal solution might not be immediately obvious.
[/Summary]

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:
4
3
-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1
1 2

Output:

R+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+
0

1

13
L-R-L-L-L-L-R-R-R-R-L+R+L+

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: We can perform four types of operations on a segment [L, R]:
   - Increase L by 1 (L+)
   - Decrease L by 1 (L-)
   - Increase R by 1 (R+)
   - Decrease R by 1 (R-)

2. **Transformation Process**: For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment until the last one is reached. This involves:
   - Adjusting the left border (L) of the current segment to match the left border of the next segment.
   - Adjusting the right border (R) of the current segment to match the right border of the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest operation. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: L-, L+, R-, R+.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: For each test case, iterate through the segments and apply the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        initialize total_operations = 0
        initialize operations_sequence = ""
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                perform L+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.L > next_segment.L:
                perform L- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L-" to operations_sequence
            
            # Transform R
            while current_segment.R < next_segment.R:
                perform R+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.R > next_segment.R:
                perform R- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R-" to operations_sequence
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def transform_segments(test_cases):
    results = []

        N = len(segments)

        for i in range(N - 1):

            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_L < next_L:
                current_L += 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L+")
            while current_L > next_L:
                current_L -= 1
                total_operations += 1

                operations_sequence.append("R-")
        
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest sequence should be chosen.

### Identifying the Issue

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The operations should be applied in a specific order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically smallest. The order should be: L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted correctly, with each test case's result printed on separate lines.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Order of Operations**: The code did not correctly prioritize operations in the lexicographical order. The operations were applied in the order of L+, L-, R+, R-, which is incorrect.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output for the second test case was an empty string, which indicates a possible issue with how results are stored or printed.

### Correcting the Solution

1. **Adjust the Order of Operations**: Ensure that operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order: L-, L+, R-, R+.

2. **Ensure Correct Output**: Make sure that the results are stored and printed correctly for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest sequence should be chosen.

### Identifying the Issue

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The operations should be applied in a specific order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically smallest. The order should be: L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted correctly, with each test case's result printed on separate lines.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Order of Operations**: The code did not correctly prioritize operations in the lexicographical order. The operations were applied in the order of L+, L-, R+, R-, which is incorrect.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output for the second test case was an empty string, which indicates a possible issue with how results are stored or printed.

### Correcting the Solution

1. **Adjust the Order of Operations**: Ensure that operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order: L-, L+, R-, R+.

2. **Ensure Correct Output**: Make sure that the results are stored and printed correctly for each test case.

### Revised Solution

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:

-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: We can perform four types of operations on a segment [L, R]:
   - Increase L by 1 (L+)
   - Decrease L by 1 (L-)
   - Increase R by 1 (R+)
   - Decrease R by 1 (R-)

2. **Transformation Process**: For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment until the last one is reached. This involves:
   - Adjusting the left border (L) of the current segment to match the left border of the next segment.
   - Adjusting the right border (R) of the current segment to match the right border of the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest operation. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: L-, L+, R-, R+.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: For each test case, iterate through the segments and apply the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        initialize total_operations = 0
        initialize operations_sequence = ""
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                perform L+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.L > next_segment.L:

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest sequence should be chosen.

### Identifying the Issue

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The operations should be applied in a specific order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically smallest. The order should be: L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted correctly, with each test case's result printed on separate lines.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Order of Operations**: The code did not correctly prioritize operations in the lexicographical order. The operations were applied in the order of L+, L-, R+, R-, which is incorrect.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output for the second test case was an empty string, which indicates a possible issue with how results are stored or printed.

### Correcting the Solution

1. **Adjust the Order of Operations**: Ensure that operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order: L-, L+, R-, R+.

2. **Ensure Correct Output**: Make sure that the results are stored and printed correctly for each test case.

### Revised Solution

def transform_segments(test_cases):

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing at most one operation of removing a character from any position in the string and inserting it back at any other position. The challenge was to ensure that the solution explored all possible single-character moves to achieve the smallest lexicographical order.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Lexicographical Order**: Understanding how to compare strings based on dictionary order was crucial.
    - **String Manipulation**: The problem required generating new strings by removing and reinserting characters, which involved careful handling of string slicing and concatenation.

    ### Strategies:
    - Initially, the approach was to move the smallest character to the front, which worked for some cases but not all. This strategy was too simplistic and didn't account for all possible rearrangements.
    - The successful strategy involved iterating over all characters, removing each one, and trying to find the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character. The initial approach was to move the smallest character to the front, but this was insufficient for all cases. The correct approach involved iterating over all possible single-character moves, generating new strings, and comparing them to find the smallest lexicographical order. This approach ensures that all potential rearrangements are considered, leading to the correct solution. The key takeaway is to consider all possible operations when the problem allows for a single move, as the optimal solution might not be immediately obvious.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] Let's address the issues in the previous solution and ensure that the operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order. The operations should be prioritized as L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions

- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:

-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4
4 6
3 5
-1 1

Output:

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: We can perform four types of operations on a segment [L, R]:
   - Increase L by 1 (L+)
   - Decrease L by 1 (L-)
   - Increase R by 1 (R+)
   - Decrease R by 1 (R-)

2. **Transformation Process**: For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment until the last one is reached. This involves:
   - Adjusting the left border (L) of the current segment to match the left border of the next segment.
   - Adjusting the right border (R) of the current segment to match the right border of the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest operation. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: L-, L+, R-, R+.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: For each test case, iterate through the segments and apply the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        initialize total_operations = 0
        initialize operations_sequence = ""
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                perform L+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.L > next_segment.L:
                perform L- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L-" to operations_sequence
            
            # Transform R
            while current_segment.R < next_segment.R:
                perform R+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.R > next_segment.R:
                perform R- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R-" to operations_sequence
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def transform_segments(test_cases):
    results = []
    for segments in test_cases:
        N = len(segments)
        total_operations = 0

        for i in range(N - 1):

            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_L < next_L:
                current_L += 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L+")
            while current_L > next_L:
                current_L -= 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L-")
            
            # Transform R
            while current_R < next_R:
                current_R += 1

                operations_sequence.append("R-")
        
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Example usage:
# Read input

        segments.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append(segments)

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest sequence should be chosen.

### Identifying the Issue

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The operations should be applied in a specific order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically smallest. The order should be: L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted correctly, with each test case's result printed on separate lines.

1. **Order of Operations**: The code did not correctly prioritize operations in the lexicographical order. The operations were applied in the order of L+, L-, R+, R-, which is incorrect.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output for the second test case was an empty string, which indicates a possible issue with how results are stored or printed.

### Correcting the Solution

1. **Adjust the Order of Operations**: Ensure that operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order: L-, L+, R-, R+.

2. **Ensure Correct Output**: Make sure that the results are stored and printed correctly for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest sequence should be chosen.

### Identifying the Issue

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The operations should be applied in a specific order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically smallest. The order should be: L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted correctly, with each test case's result printed on separate lines.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Order of Operations**: The code did not correctly prioritize operations in the lexicographical order. The operations were applied in the order of L+, L-, R+, R-, which is incorrect.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Segment Transformation Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem involves transforming a sequence of segments using a minimal number of operations, with a focus on achieving the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations. The operations allowed are shifting the left or right border of a segment by one unit, either increasing or decreasing it. The key challenge is to apply these operations in the correct order to minimize both the number of operations and the lexicographical order.

#### Strategies and Challenges
Initially, the solution focused on transforming each segment to the next by adjusting the left and right borders. However, the order of operations was not correctly prioritized, leading to incorrect lexicographical sequences. The correct order should be L-, L+, R-, R+, ensuring that adjustments to the left border are prioritized over the right, and within each border, decreasing operations are prioritized over increasing ones.

#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
The main error was in the order of operations, which was not initially aligned with the lexicographical requirements. Additionally, there was an issue with output formatting, where some test cases resulted in empty strings. This was due to incorrect handling of operations and sequence storage. By carefully reordering the operations and ensuring correct sequence construction, these issues were resolved.

#### Final Solution
The final solution correctly applies operations in the order of L-, L+, R-, R+, and ensures that the results are stored and printed correctly for each test case. This approach guarantees both the minimal number of operations and the lexicographically smallest sequence, aligning with the problem's requirements.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
-----Problem Statement-----
Chef has a sequence of N segments: [L1, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [LN, RN]. He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform

the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.

Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).

Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. 

The following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.

-----Output-----
For each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations

without any whitespaces.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T, N â‰¤ 1000.
- -1000 â‰¤ Li < Ri â‰¤ 1000.
The total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.

-----Example-----
Input:

-1 0
0 1
3 5
1
0 1
3
-2 -1
-2 -1
-2 0
4

Output:

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Operations**: We can perform four types of operations on a segment [L, R]:
   - Increase L by 1 (L+)
   - Decrease L by 1 (L-)
   - Increase R by 1 (R+)
   - Decrease R by 1 (R-)

2. **Transformation Process**: For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment until the last one is reached. This involves:
   - Adjusting the left border (L) of the current segment to match the left border of the next segment.
   - Adjusting the right border (R) of the current segment to match the right border of the next segment.

3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest operation. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: L-, L+, R-, R+.

4. **Iterate Through Segments**: For each test case, iterate through the segments and apply the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one.

### Pseudocode

```
function transform_segments(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N
        read segments
        initialize total_operations = 0
        initialize operations_sequence = ""
        
        for i from 0 to N-2:
            current_segment = segments[i]
            next_segment = segments[i+1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_segment.L < next_segment.L:
                perform L+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.L > next_segment.L:
                perform L- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "L-" to operations_sequence
            
            # Transform R
            while current_segment.R < next_segment.R:
                perform R+ operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R+" to operations_sequence
            while current_segment.R > next_segment.R:
                perform R- operation
                increment total_operations
                append "R-" to operations_sequence
        
        print total_operations
        print operations_sequence
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def transform_segments(test_cases):
    results = []
    for segments in test_cases:
        N = len(segments)
        total_operations = 0

        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_L, current_R = segments[i]
            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_L < next_L:
                current_L += 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L+")
            while current_L > next_L:
                current_L -= 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L-")
            
            # Transform R
            while current_R < next_R:
                current_R += 1

        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Example usage:
# Read input

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The problem requires transforming a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest sequence should be chosen.

### Identifying the Issue

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The operations should be applied in a specific order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically smallest. The order should be: L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted correctly, with each test case's result printed on separate lines.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Order of Operations**: The code did not correctly prioritize operations in the lexicographical order. The operations were applied in the order of L+, L-, R+, R-, which is incorrect.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output for the second test case was an empty string, which indicates a possible issue with how results are stored or printed.

### Correcting the Solution

1. **Adjust the Order of Operations**: Ensure that operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order: L-, L+, R-, R+.

2. **Ensure Correct Output**: Make sure that the results are stored and printed correctly for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 896 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The task is to transform a sequence of segments from the first to the last using the minimal number of operations. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest sequence should be chosen.

### Identifying the Issue

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The operations should be applied in a specific order to ensure the sequence is lexicographically smallest. The order should be: L-, L+, R-, R+. This means when both L and R need to be adjusted, L should be adjusted first, and within L adjustments, L- should be prioritized over L+.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be formatted correctly, with each test case's result printed on separate lines.

### Where the Code Went Wrong

1. **Order of Operations**: The code did not correctly prioritize operations in the lexicographical order. The operations were applied in the order of L+, L-, R+, R-, which is incorrect.

2. **Output Formatting**: The output for the second test case was an empty string, which indicates a possible issue with how results are stored or printed.

### Correcting the Solution

1. **Adjust the Order of Operations**: Ensure that operations are applied in the correct lexicographical order: L-, L+, R-, R+.

2. **Ensure Correct Output**: Make sure that the results are stored and printed correctly for each test case.

### Revised Solution

def transform_segments(test_cases):
    results = []
    for segments in test_cases:
        N = len(segments)
        total_operations = 0

        for i in range(N - 1):
            current_L, current_R = segments[i]
            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]
            
            # Transform L
            while current_L > next_L:
                current_L -= 1
                total_operations += 1
                operations_sequence.append("L-")
            while current_L < next_L:

                operations_sequence.append("R+")
        
        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))
    
    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:
        print(total_operations)
        print(operations_sequence)

# Example usage:

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for tc in range(int(input())):
 N = int(input())
 a, b = list(map(int, input().split()))
 pr = []

 # 'L' is lexicographically lower than 'R'.
 # so, we should first try to apply L+ or L-
 # if we can't then only we'll try to apply R+ or R-

 for i in range(N - 1):
  l, r = list(map(int, input().split()))

  #continue the following process until a == l and b == r
  while a != l or b != r:
   # trying to apply L-
   if a > l:
    a -= 1
    pr.append('L-')

   # now, trying to apply L+ (if a < b)
   elif a + 1 < b and a < l:
    a += 1
    pr.append('L+')

   # ok, so far, so good... now, let's try to apply R+
   elif b < r:
    b += 1
    pr.append('R+')

   # finally, lastly, trying to apply R- (if a < b)
   elif b - 1 > a and b > r:
    b -= 1
    pr.append('R-')

 print(len(pr))
 print(''.join(pr))

INFO - [Task id] 896 [generation text] ### Reflection

The official solution provides a clear and structured approach to solving the problem by focusing on the lexicographical order of operations. Here are the key insights and steps that make the official solution effective:

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The solution prioritizes operations in the order of L-, L+, R+, R-. This ensures that the sequence of operations is lexicographically smallest. This was a crucial point that was not correctly implemented in my initial attempts.

2. **Conditional Checks**: The solution uses a series of conditional checks to determine which operation to apply. It first checks if the left boundary `a` can be decreased (L-), then if it can be increased (L+), followed by increasing the right boundary `b` (R+), and finally decreasing `b` (R-). This order respects the lexicographical priority and ensures that the segment is transformed correctly.

3. **Loop Until Transformation**: The solution uses a `while` loop to continue applying operations until the current segment matches the target segment. This ensures that all necessary transformations are applied in the correct order.

4. **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles each segment transformation in a straightforward manner, ensuring that the operations are minimal and correctly ordered.

In summary, the official solution's structured approach to prioritizing operations and using conditional checks ensures that the transformation is both minimal and lexicographically smallest. This was a key insight that was missing in my initial attempts, where the order of operations was not correctly prioritized.
