    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nChef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Operations**: We can perform four types of operations on a segment [L, R]:\n   - Increase L by 1 (L+)\n   - Decrease L by 1 (L-)\n   - Increase R by 1 (R+)\n   - Decrease R by 1 (R-)\n\n2. **Transformation Process**: For each segment in the sequence, transform it into the next segment until the last one is reached. This involves:\n   - Adjusting the left border (L) of the current segment to match the left border of the next segment.\n   - Adjusting the right border (R) of the current segment to match the right border of the next segment.\n\n3. **Lexicographical Order**: When multiple operations are possible, choose the lexicographically smallest operation. The order of operations from smallest to largest is: L-, L+, R-, R+.\n\n4. **Iterate Through Segments**: For each test case, iterate through the segments and apply the necessary operations to transform each segment into the next one.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction transform_segments(test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N\n        read segments\n        initialize total_operations = 0\n        initialize operations_sequence = \"\"\n        \n        for i from 0 to N-2:\n            current_segment = segments[i]\n            next_segment = segments[i+1]\n            \n            # Transform L\n            while current_segment.L < next_segment.L:\n                perform L+ operation\n                increment total_operations\n                append \"L+\" to operations_sequence\n            while current_segment.L > next_segment.L:\n                perform L- operation\n                increment total_operations\n                append \"L-\" to operations_sequence\n            \n            # Transform R\n            while current_segment.R < next_segment.R:\n                perform R+ operation\n                increment total_operations\n                append \"R+\" to operations_sequence\n            while current_segment.R > next_segment.R:\n                perform R- operation\n                increment total_operations\n                append \"R-\" to operations_sequence\n        \n        print total_operations\n        print operations_sequence\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef transform_segments(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for segments in test_cases:\n        N = len(segments)\n        total_operations = 0\n        operations_sequence = []\n        \n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            current_L, current_R = segments[i]\n            next_L, next_R = segments[i + 1]\n            \n            # Transform L\n            while current_L < next_L:\n                current_L += 1\n                total_operations += 1\n                operations_sequence.append(\"L+\")\n            while current_L > next_L:\n                current_L -= 1\n                total_operations += 1\n                operations_sequence.append(\"L-\")\n            \n            # Transform R\n            while current_R < next_R:\n                current_R += 1\n                total_operations += 1\n                operations_sequence.append(\"R+\")\n            while current_R > next_R:\n                current_R -= 1\n                total_operations += 1\n                operations_sequence.append(\"R-\")\n        \n        results.append((total_operations, ''.join(operations_sequence)))\n    \n    for total_operations, operations_sequence in results:\n        print(total_operations)\n        print(operations_sequence)\n\n# Example usage:\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nindex = 0\nT = int(data[index])\nindex += 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    segments = []\n    for _ in range(N):\n        L = int(data[index])\n        R = int(data[index + 1])\n        segments.append((L, R))\n        index += 2\n    test_cases.append(segments)\n\n# Solve the problem\ntransform_segments(test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the minimal number of operations and the lexicographically smallest sequence of operations to transform the first segment into the last one.",
