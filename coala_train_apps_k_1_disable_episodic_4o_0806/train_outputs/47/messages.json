Pok\u00e9mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok\u00e9mon army to resist.\n\nFirst, Andrew counted all the pok\u00e9mon\u00a0\u2014 there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok\u00e9mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.\n\nAs an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \\le b_1 < b_2 < \\dots < b_k \\le n$, and his army will consist of pok\u00e9mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \\dots, a_{b_k}$.\n\nThe strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\dots$.\n\nAndrew is experimenting with pok\u00e9mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok\u00e9mon.\n\nNote: $q=0$ in this version of the task.\n\nAndrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok\u00e9mon placement.

We need to determine this maximal alternating sum for multiple test cases. In this version of the problem, there are no swap operations to consider.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Alternating Sum**: The alternating sum of a subsequence is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on.

This is a correct approach for competitive programming, but we need to ensure that the parsing logic is correctly implemented.\n\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code processes each test case by reading `n` and `q` (where `q` is always 0), and then reads the list of strengths.

The goal is to maximize this sum by strategically selecting elements from the sequence.\n\n2. **Current Logic**: The current logic attempts to alternate between adding and subtracting elements based on a comparison with the next element. This approach is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the selection of elements to maximize the alternating sum.\n\n3. **Correct Strategy**:\n   - To maximize the alternating sum, we should aim to include the largest possible values at odd positions (1-based) and the smallest possible values at even positions.\n   - This means we should iterate through the list and decide whether to include an element based on its value and the current state of the sum.\n\n4. **Where the Solution Went Wrong**:\n   - The current solution incorrectly switches between adding and subtracting based on a comparison with the next element, which doesn't necessarily yield the maximum alternating sum.\n   - We need to be more selective about which elements to include in the subsequence to maximize the sum.\n\n### Correcting the Mistake\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the logic to selectively include elements based on their value and position.

        "content": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Alternating Sum Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum from a sequence of distinct integers. The alternating sum is calculated as `a1 - a2 + a3 - a4 + ...`. The challenge is to select a subsequence that maximizes this sum. The key insight is to strategically choose elements such that larger values are placed at odd indices (1-based) and smaller values at even indices to maximize the sum.\n\n#### Strategies and Mistakes\nInitially, I attempted a straightforward approach by alternating between adding and subtracting based on index parity. This approach failed because it didn't consider the values of the elements, leading to suboptimal results. The next attempt involved comparing consecutive elements to decide whether to switch between adding and subtracting, but this also didn't yield the correct results.\n\n#### Correct Approach\nThe correct strategy involves iterating through the list and selectively including elements based on their contribution to the alternating sum. The solution should start by adding the first element and then decide whether to continue adding or switch to subtracting based on the potential increase in the sum. This requires a more dynamic approach, considering the values of the elements rather than their positions alone.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n- The importance of understanding the problem's requirements and constraints deeply before jumping into coding.\n- The need to consider both the values and positions of elements when dealing with problems involving alternating sums or similar patterns.\n- The value of iteratively refining the approach based on test case feedback and understanding where the logic fails.\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of strategic element selection in maximizing sums and the pitfalls of relying solely on index-based operations without considering element values."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve the problem. This is a powerful technique for problems involving optimal subsequences or subarrays, as it allows us to build solutions incrementally and efficiently.\n\n2. **State Representation**: The DP table `dp[i][0]` and `dp[i][1]` are used to represent the maximum alternating sum up to the `i-th` element, where:\n   - `dp[i][0]` is the maximum sum if the `i-th` element is added.\n   - `dp[i][1]` is the maximum sum if the `i-th` element is subtracted.\n\n3. **Transition Logic**: The transitions are defined as:\n   - `dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] + a)`: This means we either continue the previous sequence without adding the current element or add the current element to the sequence where the previous element was subtracted.\n   - `dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] - a)`: This means we either continue the previous sequence without subtracting the current element or subtract the current element from the sequence where the previous element was added.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The DP approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, which is suitable given the constraints.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach\n\n- **Initial Misunderstanding**: My initial attempts failed because I misunderstood the problem's requirement to maximize the alternating sum. I incorrectly assumed a simple alternating pattern based on indices would suffice, which led to incorrect results.\n  \n- **Learning from Mistakes**: The official solution highlights the importance of considering all possible subsequences and using a systematic approach like dynamic programming to explore these possibilities efficiently.\n\n- **Future Application**: This experience reinforces the value of dynamic programming for problems involving optimal subsequences. It also emphasizes the need to carefully analyze problem constraints and requirements before deciding on a solution strategy."
