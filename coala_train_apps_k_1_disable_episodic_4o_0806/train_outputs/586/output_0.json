    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to process a series of test cases where each test case consists of a list of team submissions in a programming competition. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name can be scrambled in the submission list. Our task is to calculate the total score for each team and then output the teams in descending order of their scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include a scrambled team name and a score.\n\n2. **Normalize Team Names**: Since the order of characters in a team name doesn't matter, normalize each team name by sorting its characters. This will allow us to uniquely identify each team regardless of the order of characters in the submissions.\n\n3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to aggregate scores for each team. The key will be the normalized team name, and the value will be the total score accumulated from all submissions.\n\n4. **Sorting**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by their total score in descending order and then by their normalized team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied.\n\n5. **Output**: For each test case, output the sorted list of teams with their scores.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_test_case():\n    read N and R\n    initialize a dictionary to store team scores\n    for each submission:\n        read team_name and score\n        normalize team_name by sorting its characters\n        add score to the team's total in the dictionary\n    convert dictionary to a list of (team_name, score) tuples\n    sort the list by score descending, then by team_name lexicographically\n    output the sorted list\n\nfunction main():\n    read T (number of test cases)\n    for each test case:\n        call process_test_case\n```\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_test_case():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    # Read the first line of the test case\n    N, R = map(int, data[0].split())\n    \n    # Dictionary to store the scores of each team\n    team_scores = {}\n    \n    # Process the first R submissions\n    for i in range(1, R + 1):\n        line = data[i].split()\n        team_name = line[0]\n        score = int(line[1])\n        \n        # Normalize the team name by sorting its characters\n        normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))\n        \n        # Add the score to the team's total score\n        if normalized_name in team_scores:\n            team_scores[normalized_name] += score\n        else:\n            team_scores[normalized_name] = score\n    \n    # Process the remaining N-R submissions\n    for i in range(R + 1, N + 1):\n        line = data[i].split()\n        team_name = line[0]\n        score = int(line[1])\n        \n        # Normalize the team name by sorting its characters\n        normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))\n        \n        # Add the score to the team's total score\n        if normalized_name in team_scores:\n            team_scores[normalized_name] += score\n        else:\n            team_scores[normalized_name] = score\n    \n    # Convert the dictionary to a list of tuples and sort it\n    sorted_teams = sorted(team_scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n    \n    # Output the sorted teams\n    for team, score in sorted_teams:\n        print(team, score)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    \n    # Index to track the current line in the input\n    index = 1\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the first line of the test case\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())\n        \n        # Dictionary to store the scores of each team\n        team_scores = {}\n        \n        # Process the first R submissions\n        for i in range(index + 1, index + R + 1):\n            line = data[i].split()\n            team_name = line[0]\n            score = int(line[1])\n            \n            # Normalize the team name by sorting its characters\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))\n            \n            # Add the score to the team's total score\n            if normalized_name in team_scores:\n                team_scores[normalized_name] += score\n            else:\n                team_scores[normalized_name] = score\n        \n        # Process the remaining N-R submissions\n        for i in range(index + R + 1, index + N + 1):\n            line = data[i].split()\n            team_name = line[0]\n            score = int(line[1])\n            \n            # Normalize the team name by sorting its characters\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))\n            \n            # Add the score to the team's total score\n            if normalized_name in team_scores:\n                team_scores[normalized_name] += score\n            else:\n                team_scores[normalized_name] = score\n        \n        # Convert the dictionary to a list of tuples and sort it\n        sorted_teams = sorted(team_scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Output the sorted teams\n        for team, score in sorted_teams:\n            print(team, score)\n        \n        # Update the index to the next test case\n        index += N + 1\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```",
