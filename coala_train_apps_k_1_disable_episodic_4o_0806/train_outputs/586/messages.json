The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.\n$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. \nThat means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').\nIt is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.\n\n-----Input:-----Input:\n- \nFirst line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

The core concept involved sorting subtasks by score and counting these decreases to determine a difficulty metric for each problem.\n\n    Initially, the solution encapsulated the logic within a function but failed to call it, resulting in no output. This highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed, especially when handling input and output in competitive programming environments.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. Parsing input correctly using `sys.stdin.read()` to handle large input sizes efficiently.\n    2. Sorting subtasks by score and counting decreases in the number of contestants.\n    3. Sorting problems by difficulty and outputting the indices in the required order.\n\n    The key takeaway is to always ensure that the main function is called, especially when dealing with input/output in a competitive programming context.

Here are some insights and learnings from the exercise:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The problem required reading a large amount of input data efficiently. Using `sys.stdin.read()` was appropriate for competitive programming environments, but it was crucial to ensure the function was called to execute the logic.\n\n    2. **Sorting Logic**: The difficulty was determined by counting decreases in the number of contestants solving subtasks as scores increased.

The official solution used a dictionary to map scores to contestant numbers, which was a clean way to handle the data.\n\n    3. **Sorting Problems**: The official solution used a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score, which allowed for efficient sorting and output. This approach was insightful as it separated the concerns of calculating difficulty and sorting problems, making the code more modular and easier to understand.\n\n    4. **Output**: The official solution sorted the problems by difficulty and then by index, which was a key requirement. It used a combination of sorting keys and list operations to achieve the desired order.\n\n    Overall, the official solution was efficient and well-structured, providing a clear approach to handling the problem's requirements.

The key challenge was ensuring that the output used the original team names as they appeared in the first half-hour submissions, rather than the normalized (sorted) versions.\n\n### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n- **Normalization**: Sorting the characters of team names to create a unique identifier for each team, regardless of the order of characters in the submissions.\n- **Mapping**: Maintaining a mapping from normalized names to original names to ensure correct output formatting.\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the teams by their total scores in descending order and using lexicographical order for tie-breaking.\n\n### Strategies:\n- **Initial Mistake**: The initial solution outputted normalized team names, which was incorrect. This was due to not maintaining a reference to the original team names.\n- **Correction**: Introduced a dictionary to map normalized names to their original names, ensuring that the output used the correct team names.\n\n### Lessons Learned:\n- Always ensure that the output format matches the problem requirements, especially when dealing with transformations like normalization.\n- When normalizing data for processing, keep track of the original data if it is needed for the final output.\n- Sorting by multiple criteria (score and lexicographical order) can be efficiently handled using Python's `sorted()` with a custom key function.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the utility of dictionaries for mapping and aggregation tasks."

        "content": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem involved processing team submissions where team names could be scrambled, and the task was to aggregate scores and sort the results. The key challenge was handling the scrambled team names and ensuring the output format was correct.\n\n#### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Normalization of Team Names**: The crucial step was to normalize team names by sorting their characters. This allowed us to uniquely identify teams regardless of the order of characters in their names.\n\n2. **Mapping Original Names**: A significant insight was the need to map normalized names back to their original names as they appeared in the first half-hour submissions. This was necessary to produce the correct output format.\n\n3. **Sorting and Output**: The sorting had to be done based on scores in descending order and then by the original team names lexicographically. This required careful handling of the data structures to ensure the correct order.\n\n#### Comparison with Official Solution:\n\n- The official solution uses a clever trick by subtracting scores from a large number (`10**10`) to handle sorting in descending order naturally. This is a neat way to avoid using a custom sorting function.\n- The official solution also maintains a list of sorted character arrays (`sr`) to match scrambled names efficiently, which is similar to the normalization approach used in my solution.\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly, especially regarding input/output formats, and the utility of normalization techniques in handling permutations. The official solution provided a more concise way to handle sorting by leveraging arithmetic operations, which is a useful trick for future problems involving sorting by multiple criteria."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of submissions with team names and scores. It processes each test case by normalizing team names (sorting the characters in the name) to handle potential anagrams, and aggregates scores for each normalized team name. The function then sorts the teams first by their total scores in descending order and then by their original names in lexicographical order if scores are tied. Finally, it outputs the sorted list of teams with their original names and total scores for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to handle and process data that involves grouping by a normalized form of a string, such as anagrams, and then sorting based on multiple criteria. For example, in competitive programming or data processing tasks where you need to aggregate scores or values based on a key that can appear in different forms (like anagrams), this approach of normalizing the key by sorting its characters can be applied. Additionally, the solution demonstrates how to efficiently handle input and output in competitive programming contexts, especially when dealing with large datasets, by using dictionaries for aggregation and sorting with custom criteria."
