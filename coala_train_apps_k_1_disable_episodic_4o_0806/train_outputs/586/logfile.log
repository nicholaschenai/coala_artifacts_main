## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq pi \leq 10^6$
Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.

We have a programming competition where each team submits their team name and score. Due to an error, the order of characters in team names got scrambled, but each team name is unique based on character frequency. We need to calculate the total score for each team and print the results in descending order of scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour.
2. **Team Identification**: Use a dictionary to map sorted team names (as keys) to their actual team names and scores.
3. **Score Aggregation**: For each submission, sort the team name to find the correct team and add the score to their total.
4. **Sorting and Output**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by score in descending order, then by team name lexicographically if scores are tied. Print the results.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case():
    read N, R
    initialize team_scores as an empty dictionary
    initialize team_names as an empty dictionary

    for i from 1 to R:
        read team_name, score
        sorted_name = sort_characters(team_name)
        team_scores[sorted_name] = score
        team_names[sorted_name] = team_name

    for i from 1 to N-R:
        read scrambled_name, score
        sorted_name = sort_characters(scrambled_name)
        team_scores[sorted_name] += score

    create a list of (team_name, score) from team_scores and team_names
    sort the list by score descending, then by team_name lexicographically

    for each team in sorted list:
        print team_name, score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        process_test_case()
```

### Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    N, R = map(int, data[0].split())
    team_scores = {}
    team_names = {}
    
    # Process the first R submissions
    for i in range(1, R + 1):
        line = data[i].strip()
        team_name, score = line.rsplit(' ', 1)
        score = int(score)
        sorted_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))
        team_scores[sorted_name] = score
        team_names[sorted_name] = team_name
    
    # Process the remaining N-R submissions
    for i in range(R + 1, N + 1):
        line = data[i].strip()
        scrambled_name, score = line.rsplit(' ', 1)
        score = int(score)
        sorted_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_name))
        if sorted_name in team_scores:
            team_scores[sorted_name] += score
    
    # Prepare the result list
    result = [(team_names[sorted_name], score) for sorted_name, score in team_scores.items()]
    
    # Sort by score descending, then by team name lexicographically
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
    
    # Print the result
    for team_name, score in result:
        print(f"{team_name} {score}")

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())
        process_test_case()
        index += N + 1

main()
```

This solution reads input directly from standard input, processes each test case by aggregating scores based on sorted team names, and outputs the results in the required order.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine the difficulty of contest problems based on the number of subtasks where the number of contestants solving them decreases as the score increases. The core concept involved sorting subtasks by score and counting these decreases to determine a difficulty metric for each problem.

    Initially, the solution encapsulated the logic within a function but failed to call it, resulting in no output. This highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed, especially when handling input and output in competitive programming environments.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Parsing input correctly using `sys.stdin.read()` to handle large input sizes efficiently.
    2. Sorting subtasks by score and counting decreases in the number of contestants.
    3. Sorting problems by difficulty and outputting the indices in the required order.

    The key takeaway is to always ensure that the main function is called, especially when dealing with input/output in a competitive programming context. Additionally, understanding how to manipulate and sort data based on custom criteria is crucial for solving similar problems.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to process a series of test cases where each test case consists of a list of team submissions in a programming competition. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name can be scrambled in the submission list. Our task is to calculate the total score for each team and then output the teams in descending order of their scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include a scrambled team name and a score.

2. **Normalize Team Names**: Since the order of characters in a team name doesn't matter, normalize each team name by sorting its characters. This will allow us to uniquely identify each team regardless of the order of characters in the submissions.

3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to aggregate scores for each team. The key will be the normalized team name, and the value will be the total score accumulated from all submissions.

4. **Sorting**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by their total score in descending order and then by their normalized team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied.

5. **Output**: For each test case, output the sorted list of teams with their scores.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case():
    read N and R
    initialize a dictionary to store team scores
    for each submission:
        read team_name and score
        normalize team_name by sorting its characters
        add score to the team's total in the dictionary
    convert dictionary to a list of (team_name, score) tuples
    sort the list by score descending, then by team_name lexicographically
    output the sorted list

function main():
    read T (number of test cases)
    for each test case:
        call process_test_case
```

 ## Problem Restatement

We need to process a series of test cases where each test case consists of a list of team submissions in a programming competition. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name can be scrambled in the submission list. Our task is to calculate the total score for each team and then output the teams in descending order of their scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include a scrambled team name and a score.

2. **Normalize Team Names**: Since the order of characters in a team name doesn't matter, normalize each team name by sorting its characters. This will allow us to uniquely identify each team regardless of the order of characters in the submissions.

3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to aggregate scores for each team. The key will be the normalized team name, and the value will be the total score accumulated from all submissions.

4. **Sorting**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by their total score in descending order and then by their normalized team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied.

5. **Output**: For each test case, output the sorted list of teams with their scores.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case():
    read N and R
    initialize a dictionary to store team scores
    for each submission:
        read team_name and score
        normalize team_name by sorting its characters
        add score to the team's total in the dictionary
    convert dictionary to a list of (team_name, score) tuples
    sort the list by score descending, then by team_name lexicographically
    output the sorted list

function main():
    read T (number of test cases)
    for each test case:
        call process_test_case
```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq pi \leq 10^6$
Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Normalization of Team Names**: The solution correctly normalizes team names by sorting the characters. This ensures that different permutations of the same team name are treated as the same team.

2. **Score Aggregation**: The solution aggregates scores for each normalized team name correctly.

3. **Sorting and Output**: The solution sorts the teams by score in descending order and by team name lexicographically. However, the output format is incorrect. The expected output requires the original team names, not the normalized ones.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

- **Output Format**: The solution outputs the normalized team names instead of the original team names. The expected output should display the original team names as they appeared in the first half-hour submissions.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Store Original Team Names**: When normalizing team names, store a mapping from the normalized name to the original name that appeared in the first half-hour submissions.

2. **Use Original Names for Output**: When outputting the results, use the original team names instead of the normalized ones.

3. **Adjust Sorting**: Ensure that sorting is done based on scores and then by the original team names lexicographically.

Let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])

### Explanation of Corrections

- **Original Names Mapping**: We maintain a dictionary `original_names` to map each normalized name to its original name from the first half-hour submissions.
- **Output**: We use the `original_names` dictionary to output the original team names instead of the normalized ones.
- **Sorting**: The sorting now uses the original team names for lexicographical comparison when scores are tied.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$

Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to process a series of test cases where each test case consists of a list of team submissions in a programming competition. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name can be scrambled in the submission list. Our task is to calculate the total score for each team and then output the teams in descending order of their scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include a scrambled team name and a score.

2. **Normalize Team Names**: Since the order of characters in a team name doesn't matter, normalize each team name by sorting its characters. This will allow us to uniquely identify each team regardless of the order of characters in the submissions.

3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to aggregate scores for each team. The key will be the normalized team name, and the value will be the total score accumulated from all submissions.

4. **Sorting**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by their total score in descending order and then by their normalized team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied.

5. **Output**: For each test case, output the sorted list of teams with their scores.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case():
    read N and R
    initialize a dictionary to store team scores
    for each submission:
        read team_name and score
        normalize team_name by sorting its characters
        add score to the team's total in the dictionary
    convert dictionary to a list of (team_name, score) tuples
    sort the list by score descending, then by team_name lexicographically
    output the sorted list

function main():
    read T (number of test cases)
    for each test case:
        call process_test_case
```

    ### Reflection

    The problem involved sorting problems based on a calculated difficulty metric, which required careful handling of input and sorting logic. Here are some insights and learnings from the exercise:

    1. **Input Handling**: The problem required reading a large amount of input data efficiently. Using `sys.stdin.read()` was appropriate for competitive programming environments, but it was crucial to ensure the function was called to execute the logic.

    2. **Sorting Logic**: The difficulty was determined by counting decreases in the number of contestants solving subtasks as scores increased. This required sorting subtasks by score and then iterating to count decreases. The official solution used a dictionary to map scores to contestant numbers, which was a clean way to handle the data.

    3. **Sorting Problems**: The official solution used a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score, which allowed for efficient sorting and output. This approach was insightful as it separated the concerns of calculating difficulty and sorting problems, making the code more modular and easier to understand.

    4. **Output**: The official solution sorted the problems by difficulty and then by index, which was a key requirement. It used a combination of sorting keys and list operations to achieve the desired order.

    Overall, the official solution was efficient and well-structured, providing a clear approach to handling the problem's requirements. The use of dictionaries for grouping and sorting was particularly insightful and could be useful in similar problems where categorization and sorting are needed.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] Let's fix the solution by ensuring that we output the original team names instead of the normalized ones. We'll maintain a mapping from normalized names to the original names as they appeared in the first half-hour submissions.

Here's the corrected Python code:

### Explanation of Corrections

- **Original Names Mapping**: We maintain a dictionary `original_names` to map each normalized name to its original name from the first half-hour submissions.
- **Output**: We use the `original_names` dictionary to output the original team names instead of the normalized ones.
- **Sorting**: The sorting now uses the original team names for lexicographical comparison when scores are tied.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to process a series of test cases where each test case consists of a list of team submissions in a programming competition. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name can be scrambled in the submission list. Our task is to calculate the total score for each team and then output the teams in descending order of their scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include a scrambled team name and a score.

2. **Normalize Team Names**: Since the order of characters in a team name doesn't matter, normalize each team name by sorting its characters. This will allow us to uniquely identify each team regardless of the order of characters in the submissions.

3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to aggregate scores for each team. The key will be the normalized team name, and the value will be the total score accumulated from all submissions.

4. **Sorting**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by their total score in descending order and then by their normalized team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied.

5. **Output**: For each test case, output the sorted list of teams with their scores.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case():
    read N and R
    initialize a dictionary to store team scores
    for each submission:
        read team_name and score
        normalize team_name by sorting its characters
        add score to the team's total in the dictionary
    convert dictionary to a list of (team_name, score) tuples
    sort the list by score descending, then by team_name lexicographically
    output the sorted list

function main():
    read T (number of test cases)
    for each test case:
        call process_test_case
```

## Python Solution

def process_test_case():

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Normalization of Team Names**: The solution correctly normalizes team names by sorting the characters. This ensures that different permutations of the same team name are treated as the same team.

2. **Score Aggregation**: The solution aggregates scores for each normalized team name correctly.

3. **Sorting and Output**: The solution sorts the teams by score in descending order and by team name lexicographically. However, the output format is incorrect. The expected output requires the original team names, not the normalized ones.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

- **Output Format**: The solution outputs the normalized team names instead of the original team names. The expected output should display the original team names as they appeared in the first half-hour submissions.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Store Original Team Names**: When normalizing team names, store a mapping from the normalized name to the original name that appeared in the first half-hour submissions.

2. **Use Original Names for Output**: When outputting the results, use the original team names instead of the normalized ones.

3. **Adjust Sorting**: Ensure that sorting is done based on scores and then by the original team names lexicographically.

Let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    
    # Index to track the current line in the input
    index = 1
    
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the first line of the test case
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())
        
        # Dictionary to store the scores of each team
        team_scores = {}
        # Dictionary to map normalized names to original names
        original_names = {}
        
        # Process the first R submissions

                original_names[normalized_name] = team_name
            
            # Add the score to the team's total score
            if normalized_name in team_scores:
                team_scores[normalized_name] += score
            else:

                team_scores[normalized_name] += score
            else:
                team_scores[normalized_name] = score
        
        # Convert the dictionary to a list of tuples and sort it
        sorted_teams = sorted(
            team_scores.items(), 
            key=lambda x: (-x[1], original_names[x[0]])
        )
        
        # Output the sorted teams using original names

### Explanation of Corrections

- **Original Names Mapping**: We maintain a dictionary `original_names` to map each normalized name to its original name from the first half-hour submissions.
- **Output**: We use the `original_names` dictionary to output the original team names instead of the normalized ones.
- **Sorting**: The sorting now uses the original team names for lexicographical comparison when scores are tied.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to handle team names that could appear in any scrambled order in the submissions and to aggregate scores correctly. The key challenge was ensuring that the output used the original team names as they appeared in the first half-hour submissions, rather than the normalized (sorted) versions.

### Key Concepts and Patterns:
- **Normalization**: Sorting the characters of team names to create a unique identifier for each team, regardless of the order of characters in the submissions.
- **Mapping**: Maintaining a mapping from normalized names to original names to ensure correct output formatting.
- **Sorting**: Sorting the teams by their total scores in descending order and using lexicographical order for tie-breaking.

### Strategies:
- **Initial Mistake**: The initial solution outputted normalized team names, which was incorrect. This was due to not maintaining a reference to the original team names.
- **Correction**: Introduced a dictionary to map normalized names to their original names, ensuring that the output used the correct team names.

### Lessons Learned:
- Always ensure that the output format matches the problem requirements, especially when dealing with transformations like normalization.
- When normalizing data for processing, keep track of the original data if it is needed for the final output.
- Sorting by multiple criteria (score and lexicographical order) can be efficiently handled using Python's `sorted()` with a custom key function.

This problem reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the utility of dictionaries for mapping and aggregation tasks.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to process a series of test cases where each test case consists of a list of team submissions in a programming competition. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name can be scrambled in the submission list. Our task is to calculate the total score for each team and then output the teams in descending order of their scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include a scrambled team name and a score.

2. **Normalize Team Names**: Since the order of characters in a team name doesn't matter, normalize each team name by sorting its characters. This will allow us to uniquely identify each team regardless of the order of characters in the submissions.

3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to aggregate scores for each team. The key will be the normalized team name, and the value will be the total score accumulated from all submissions.

4. **Sorting**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by their total score in descending order and then by their normalized team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied.

5. **Output**: For each test case, output the sorted list of teams with their scores.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case():
    read N and R
    initialize a dictionary to store team scores
    for each submission:
        read team_name and score
        normalize team_name by sorting its characters
        add score to the team's total in the dictionary
    convert dictionary to a list of (team_name, score) tuples
    sort the list by score descending, then by team_name lexicographically
    output the sorted list

function main():
    read T (number of test cases)
    for each test case:
        call process_test_case
```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it went wrong:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Normalization of Team Names**: The solution correctly normalizes team names by sorting the characters. This ensures that different permutations of the same team name are treated as the same team.

2. **Score Aggregation**: The solution aggregates scores for each normalized team name correctly.

3. **Sorting and Output**: The solution sorts the teams by score in descending order and by team name lexicographically. However, the output format is incorrect. The expected output requires the original team names, not the normalized ones.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

- **Output Format**: The solution outputs the normalized team names instead of the original team names. The expected output should display the original team names as they appeared in the first half-hour submissions.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Store Original Team Names**: When normalizing team names, store a mapping from the normalized name to the original name that appeared in the first half-hour submissions.

2. **Use Original Names for Output**: When outputting the results, use the original team names instead of the normalized ones.

3. **Adjust Sorting**: Ensure that sorting is done based on scores and then by the original team names lexicographically.

Let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])

        # Dictionary to map normalized names to original names

### Explanation of Corrections

- **Original Names Mapping**: We maintain a dictionary `original_names` to map each normalized name to its original name from the first half-hour submissions.
- **Output**: We use the `original_names` dictionary to output the original team names instead of the normalized ones.
- **Sorting**: The sorting now uses the original team names for lexicographical comparison when scores are tied.

The problem involved processing team submissions where team names could be scrambled, and the task was to aggregate scores and sort the results. The key challenge was handling the scrambled team names and ensuring the output format was correct.

#### Key Insights:

1. **Normalization of Team Names**: The crucial step was to normalize team names by sorting their characters. This allowed us to uniquely identify teams regardless of the order of characters in their names.

2. **Mapping Original Names**: A significant insight was the need to map normalized names back to their original names as they appeared in the first half-hour submissions. This was necessary to produce the correct output format.

3. **Sorting and Output**: The sorting had to be done based on scores in descending order and then by the original team names lexicographically. This required careful handling of the data structures to ensure the correct order.

#### Comparison with Official Solution:

- The official solution uses a clever trick by subtracting scores from a large number (`10**10`) to handle sorting in descending order naturally. This is a neat way to avoid using a custom sorting function.
- The official solution also maintains a list of sorted character arrays (`sr`) to match scrambled names efficiently, which is similar to the normalization approach used in my solution.

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly, especially regarding input/output formats, and the utility of normalization techniques in handling permutations. The official solution provided a more concise way to handle sorting by leveraging arithmetic operations, which is a useful trick for future problems involving sorting by multiple criteria.

[Problem]
    Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
    $N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
    That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
    It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

    -----Input:-----Input:
    - 
    First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - 
    The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
    - 
    Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
    - 
    Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

    -----Output:-----Output:
    For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
    That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order
