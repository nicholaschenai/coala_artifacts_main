The series is defined by a specific pattern, and we need to determine this pattern to compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: \n   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...\n   - By examining the differences between consecutive terms, we can identify a pattern:\n     - 1 - 0 = 1\n     - 5 - 1 = 4\n     - 14 - 5 = 9\n     - 30 - 14 = 16\n     - 55 - 30 = 25\n   - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...\n\n2. **Formulate the Series**:\n   - The N'th term can be expressed as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n   - The formula for the N'th term is: `S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (N-1)^2`.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - Use the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n   - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term in constant time.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula and output the result.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction sum_of_squares(n):\n    return (n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) // 6\n\nfunction find_nth_term(N):\n    if N == 1:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return sum_of_squares(N-1)\n\nread T\nfor each test case:\n    read N\n    result = find_nth_term(N)\n    print result\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(n):\n    # Calculate the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers\n    return (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6\n\ndef find_nth_term(N):\n    # If N is 1, the term is 0\n    if N == 1:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, calculate the sum of squares up to (N-1)\n        return sum_of_squares(N - 1)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        result = find_nth_term(N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code reads input from standard input, computes the N'th term for each test case using the derived formula, and outputs the results.

The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.\n    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.\n    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.\n    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(N, K):\n        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))\n        min_f = N - 1\n        if K < min_f or K > max_f:\n            return -1\n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = max_f\n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]\n            if current_f - decrease >= K:\n                current_f -= decrease\n                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n        return permutation\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = find_permutation(N, K)\n            if result == -1:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
