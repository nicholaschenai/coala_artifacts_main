INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... and need to find the N'th number in this series for multiple test cases. The series is defined by a specific pattern, and we need to determine this pattern to compute the N'th term efficiently.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   - By examining the differences between consecutive terms, we can identify a pattern:
     - 1 - 0 = 1
     - 5 - 1 = 4
     - 14 - 5 = 9
     - 30 - 14 = 16
     - 55 - 30 = 25
   - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

2. **Formulate the Series**:
   - The N'th term can be expressed as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.
   - The formula for the N'th term is: `S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (N-1)^2`.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Use the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
   - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term in constant time.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula and output the result.

## Pseudocode

```
function sum_of_squares(n):
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) // 6

function find_nth_term(N):
    if N == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return sum_of_squares(N-1)

read T
for each test case:
    read N
    result = find_nth_term(N)
    print result
```

## Python Code

```python
def sum_of_squares(n):
    # Calculate the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6

def find_nth_term(N):
    # If N is 1, the term is 0
    if N == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        # Otherwise, calculate the sum of squares up to (N-1)
        return sum_of_squares(N - 1)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = find_nth_term(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

main()
```

This code reads input from standard input, computes the N'th term for each test case using the derived formula, and outputs the results. The use of the sum of squares formula ensures that each term is computed efficiently in constant time.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements equals a given integer K. The core concept was understanding the function f(P) and the constraints on its possible values.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Function f(P):** This function calculates the sum of the maximum of each pair of consecutive elements in a permutation.
    - **Constraints:** The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, and the maximum is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers (from N to 2).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Approach:** Start with the permutation in decreasing order to achieve the maximum f(P) and adjust it to reach the desired K.
    - **Adjustment Logic:** Swap elements to decrease f(P) until it matches K, ensuring the swaps are valid and maintain the permutation's integrity.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call:** Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function is called fixed this issue.
    - **Permutation Adjustment:** The logic needed careful handling to ensure the permutation was adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired K.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_permutation(N, K):
        max_f = sum(range(2, N + 1))
        min_f = N - 1
        if K < min_f or K > max_f:
            return -1
        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        current_f = max_f
        for i in range(N - 1):
            if current_f == K:
                break
            decrease = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
            if current_f - decrease >= K:
                current_f -= decrease
                permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
        return permutation

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            result = find_permutation(N, K)
            if result == -1:
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and ensuring that all parts of the solution, including function calls and input/output handling, are correctly implemented.

We need to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. The series appears to be generated by a specific pattern or formula, and our task is to determine this pattern and use it to compute the N'th term efficiently.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: First, we need to determine the pattern or formula that generates the series. By examining the differences between consecutive terms, we can deduce that the series is generated by a quadratic formula.

2. **Derive the Formula**: By analyzing the differences:
   - 1 - 0 = 1
   - 5 - 1 = 4
   - 14 - 5 = 9
   - 30 - 14 = 16
   - 55 - 30 = 25
   These differences (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...) are perfect squares (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...). This suggests that the N'th term is the sum of squares of the first N-1 natural numbers.

3. **Formula for the N'th Term**: The N'th term can be expressed as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers:
   \[
   a_N = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i^2 = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
   \]

4. **Implement the Solution**: Using the derived formula, compute the N'th term for each test case.

## Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases, T.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer N.
   - Compute the N'th term using the formula: \((N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1) / 6\).
   - Output the result.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def compute_nth_term(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term using the derived formula
    return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

def main():

        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

### Explanation

- **compute_nth_term**: This function calculates the N'th term using the formula derived from the pattern of the series.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] In this problem, I needed to determine the N'th term of a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., for multiple test cases. The key was to identify the pattern in the series. By examining the differences between consecutive terms, I noticed that they were perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...), which led to the realization that the series is generated by the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

The formula for the N'th term was derived as:
\[ a_N = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i^2 = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \]

This formula allowed for efficient computation of the N'th term, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases and N as large as 10,000). The implementation involved reading input, computing the term using the formula, and outputting the result for each test case.

The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the derived formula was implemented correctly. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and deriving formulas for efficient computation.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. The series appears to be generated by a specific pattern or formula, and our task is to determine this pattern and use it to compute the N'th term efficiently.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: First, we need to determine the pattern or formula that generates the series. By examining the differences between consecutive terms, we can deduce that the series is generated by a quadratic formula.

2. **Derive the Formula**: By analyzing the differences:
   - 1 - 0 = 1
   - 5 - 1 = 4
   - 14 - 5 = 9
   - 30 - 14 = 16
   - 55 - 30 = 25
   These differences (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...) are perfect squares (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...). This suggests that the N'th term is the sum of squares of the first N-1 natural numbers.

3. **Formula for the N'th Term**: The N'th term can be expressed as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers:
   \[
   a_N = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i^2 = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6}
   \]

4. **Implement the Solution**: Using the derived formula, compute the N'th term for each test case.

## Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases, T.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer N.
   - Compute the N'th term using the formula: \((N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1) / 6\).
   - Output the result.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def compute_nth_term(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term using the derived formula
    return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = compute_nth_term(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

main()
```

### Explanation

- **compute_nth_term**: This function calculates the N'th term using the formula derived from the pattern of the series.
- **main**: This function handles input and output. It reads all input at once, processes each test case, and prints the results. This approach is efficient for handling up to 10,000 test cases as specified by the constraints.

This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] In solving the problem of finding the N'th term in the series, I derived a formula based on the observation that the differences between consecutive terms are perfect squares. This led to the formula for the N'th term as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers. My solution was efficient and passed all test cases.

The official solution, however, uses a slightly different approach. It adjusts the index by subtracting 2 from N and then applies a formula to compute the term. The formula used in the official solution is:
\[ l = \frac{(n+1) \cdot (2n+3) \cdot (n+2)}{6} \]
This formula is mathematically equivalent to the one I derived, but it is expressed differently due to the index adjustment.

Key insights from this exercise include:
- Recognizing patterns in sequences can lead to efficient formula-based solutions.
- Different mathematical expressions can yield the same result, and understanding these equivalences can be useful.
- The importance of handling edge cases, such as when N=1, which the official solution explicitly checks.

Overall, both solutions are efficient and handle the problem constraints well, but the official solution provides an alternative perspective on deriving the formula.
