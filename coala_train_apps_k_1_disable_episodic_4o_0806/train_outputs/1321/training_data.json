    "summary": "In this problem, I needed to determine the N'th term of a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., for multiple test cases. The key was to identify the pattern in the series. By examining the differences between consecutive terms, I noticed that they were perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...), which led to the realization that the series is generated by the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\nThe formula for the N'th term was derived as:\n\\[ a_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i^2 = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2N-1)}{6} \\]\n\nThis formula allowed for efficient computation of the N'th term, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases and N as large as 10,000). The implementation involved reading input, computing the term using the formula, and outputting the result for each test case.\n\nThe solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the derived formula was implemented correctly. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and deriving formulas for efficient computation.",
    "reflection": "In solving the problem of finding the N'th term in the series, I derived a formula based on the observation that the differences between consecutive terms are perfect squares. This led to the formula for the N'th term as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers. My solution was efficient and passed all test cases.\n\nThe official solution, however, uses a slightly different approach. It adjusts the index by subtracting 2 from N and then applies a formula to compute the term. The formula used in the official solution is:\n\\[ l = \\frac{(n+1) \\cdot (2n+3) \\cdot (n+2)}{6} \\]\nThis formula is mathematically equivalent to the one I derived, but it is expressed differently due to the index adjustment.\n\nKey insights from this exercise include:\n- Recognizing patterns in sequences can lead to efficient formula-based solutions.\n- Different mathematical expressions can yield the same result, and understanding these equivalences can be useful.\n- The importance of handling edge cases, such as when N=1, which the official solution explicitly checks.\n\nOverall, both solutions are efficient and handle the problem constraints well, but the official solution provides an alternative perspective on deriving the formula.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases, followed by T integers. For each integer N, it calculates the N'th term using a specific formula and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to find a specific term in a mathematical series or sequence, especially when the series follows a specific pattern or formula. The problem involves understanding how to derive a formula for the N'th term of a series, which is a common task in mathematical problem-solving and programming competitions. This can be applied in algorithm design, data analysis, and any situation where pattern recognition and formula derivation are necessary. Additionally, the solution demonstrates efficient input handling and computation for large numbers of test cases, which is valuable in optimizing performance for large-scale data processing tasks."
