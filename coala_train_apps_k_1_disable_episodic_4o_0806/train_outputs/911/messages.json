The Golomb sequence is defined such that each term \\( G_n \\) is the number of times the integer \\( n \\) appears in the sequence. The sequence starts with \\( G_1 = 1 \\) and follows the recurrence relation \\( G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n+1-G_{G_n}} \\). For each test case, given two integers \\( L \\) and \\( R \\), we need to find the sum of squares of the terms from \\( G_L \\) to \\( G_R \\) modulo \\( 10^9+7 \\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Golomb Sequence**: The sequence is self-describing, meaning each number \\( n \\) appears \\( G_n \\) times.

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the Golomb sequence sum of squares, several key insights and learnings emerged:\n\n1. **Understanding the Golomb Sequence**: The Golomb sequence is self-describing, where each integer \\( n \\) appears \\( G_n \\) times. This property is crucial for efficiently calculating the sequence without direct iteration over large indices.\n\n2. **Precomputation and Cumulative Sums**: The approach of precomputing the Golomb sequence and using cumulative sums of squares is effective for handling large ranges. This reduces the computational complexity by allowing quick lookups and calculations using precomputed data.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: The official solution uses a binary search to find the upper bound in the precomputed data, which is a clever way to quickly determine the range of indices that need to be considered for a given query. This is more efficient than iterating through the sequence.\n\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Handling large numbers with modulo operations is essential to prevent overflow and ensure results fit within the required constraints. This is a common technique in competitive programming.\n\n5. **Function Decomposition**: Breaking down the problem into smaller functions, such as `find_upper_bound`, `get_query`, and `fire_query`, helps in managing complexity and improving code readability.\n\nOverall, the official solution provides a more efficient and scalable approach to solving the problem, especially for large input sizes. The use of binary search and cumulative sums highlights the importance of leveraging mathematical properties and precomputation in algorithm design."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data, which includes the number of test cases and pairs of integers (L, R) for each test case. It precomputes the Golomb sequence and the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence up to a specified limit. For each test case, it calculates the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence between indices L and R using the precomputed data. The results for each test case are stored in a list. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to compute properties of self-describing sequences, such as the Golomb sequence, which is defined recursively. It is particularly relevant in competitive programming and algorithm design, where efficient computation of sequence properties over large ranges is required. The problem involves calculating the sum of squares of terms in the sequence over a specified range, which is a common task in mathematical programming challenges. Understanding the recurrence relation and precomputation techniques can help in optimizing solutions for large input sizes, as seen in this problem where constraints are very large."
