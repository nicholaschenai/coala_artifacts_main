## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king visits the court. Each citizen's wealth is a unique positive integer, and a king's visit is denoted by `-1`. When the king visits, the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive is beheaded. We need to determine the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at each of the king's visits.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Data Structure Choice**: Use a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen who is still alive. A max-heap allows us to quickly retrieve and remove the largest element.

2. **Processing Events**:
   - For each citizen's wealth declaration, add the wealth to the max-heap.
   - For each king's visit (`-1`), remove the richest citizen from the heap and record their wealth as they are beheaded.

3. **Output**: For each king's visit, output the wealth of the beheaded citizen.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty max-heap.
2. For each event in the sequence:
   - If the event is a positive integer (citizen's wealth), add it to the max-heap.
   - If the event is `-1` (king's visit):
     - Remove the maximum element from the heap (the richest citizen still alive).
     - Record this wealth as the beheaded citizen's wealth.
3. Print the recorded wealths for each king's visit.

## Python Solution

```python
import sys
import heapq

def process_events():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = int(data[1])
    
    events = data[2:]
    
    # Max-heap to store the wealth of citizens
    max_heap = []
    
    # List to store the results of each king's visit
    results = []
    
    for event in events:
        if event == '-1':
            # King visits, pop the richest citizen
            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            results.append(richest)
        else:
            # Citizen declares wealth, add to heap
            wealth = int(event)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)
    
    # Output the results for each king's visit
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a max-heap to keep track of the richest citizens. Python's `heapq` module provides a min-heap, so we store negative values to simulate a max-heap.
- We read all input data at once and split it into a list of strings.
- We iterate over each event:
  - If it's a positive integer, we convert it to a negative and push it onto the heap.
  - If it's `-1`, we pop the largest (most negative) value from the heap, convert it back to positive, and record it as the wealth of the beheaded citizen.
- Finally, we print the wealth of the beheaded citizen for each king's visit.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead one player had over the other at the end of any round. The solution involved calculating cumulative scores for each player after each round and tracking the maximum lead and the player who achieved it.

    **Core Concepts:**
    - Cumulative scoring: Continuously updating scores for each player as the rounds progress.
    - Lead calculation: Determining the difference between the two players' scores to find the lead.
    - Maximum tracking: Keeping track of the maximum lead encountered and the player associated with it.

    **Strategies and Fixes:**
    - Initially, the function was defined but not called, which led to no output being generated. This was a key oversight that was corrected by explicitly calling the function at the end of the script.
    - The input was read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is suitable for competitive programming environments where input is provided in bulk. This approach worked well once the function was properly invoked.

    **Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def find_winner_and_lead():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        N = int(data[0])
        cumulative_score_player1 = 0
        cumulative_score_player2 = 0
        max_lead = 0
        winner = 0
    
        index = 1
        for _ in range(N):
            Si = int(data[index])
            Ti = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            cumulative_score_player1 += Si
            cumulative_score_player2 += Ti
        
            if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
                current_lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2
                current_leader = 1
            else:
                current_lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1
                current_leader = 2
        
            if current_lead > max_lead:
                max_lead = current_lead
                winner = current_leader
    
        print(winner, max_lead)

    find_winner_and_lead()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of cumulative calculations and lead tracking in competitive programming problems.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king visits the court. Each citizen's wealth is unique and represented by a positive integer. A king's visit is represented by `-1`. When the king visits, the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive is beheaded. We need to determine the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at each of the king's visits.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Data Structure Choice**: Use a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen who is still alive. A max-heap allows us to quickly retrieve and remove the largest element.

2. **Processing Events**:
   - For each citizen's wealth declaration, add their wealth to the max-heap.
   - For each king's visit (`-1`), remove the richest citizen from the heap and record their wealth as they are beheaded.

3. **Handling the Max-Heap**: Since Python's `heapq` is a min-heap by default, we can simulate a max-heap by inserting negative values.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_events(events):
    initialize an empty max-heap (using a list)
    initialize an empty list for results

    for each event in events:
        if event is a positive integer (citizen's wealth):
            push the negative of the event into the max-heap
        else if event is -1 (king's visit):
            pop the smallest element from the max-heap (which is the largest wealth)
            append the negative of this value to the results list

    return results
```

## Python Solution

```python
import sys
import heapq

def process_events():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = int(data[1])
    
    events = data[2:]
    
    max_heap = []
    results = []
    
    for event in events:
        if event != '-1':
            # Convert the wealth to an integer and push its negative to simulate a max-heap
            wealth = int(event)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)
        else:
            # Pop the richest (which is the smallest negative number)
            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            results.append(richest)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

process_events()
```

### Explanation

- **Heap Operations**: We use `heapq.heappush` to add elements to the heap and `heapq.heappop` to remove the smallest element. By storing negative values, we effectively turn the min-heap into a max-heap.
- **Event Processing**: We iterate over each event, adding wealth to the heap or processing a king's visit by removing the richest citizen.
- **Output**: After processing all events, we print the wealth of each beheaded citizen in the order of the king's visits.

1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king visits the court. Each citizen's wealth is unique and represented by a positive integer. A king's visit is represented by `-1`. When the king visits, the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive is beheaded. We need to determine the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at each of the king's visits.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Data Structure Choice**: Use a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen who is still alive. A max-heap allows us to quickly retrieve and remove the largest element.

2. **Processing Events**:
   - For each citizen's wealth declaration, add their wealth to the max-heap.
   - For each king's visit (`-1`), remove the richest citizen from the heap and record their wealth as they are beheaded.

3. **Handling the Max-Heap**: Since Python's `heapq` is a min-heap by default, we can simulate a max-heap by inserting negative values.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_events(events):
    initialize an empty max-heap (using a list)
    initialize an empty list for results

    for each event in events:
        if event is a positive integer (citizen's wealth):
            push the negative of the event into the max-heap
        else if event is -1 (king's visit):
            pop the smallest element from the max-heap (which is the largest wealth)
            append the negative of this value to the results list

    return results
```

## Python Solution

```python
import sys
import heapq

def process_events():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = int(data[1])
    
    events = data[2:]
    
    max_heap = []
    results = []
    
    for event in events:
        if event != '-1':
            # Convert the wealth to an integer and push its negative to simulate a max-heap
            wealth = int(event)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)
        else:
            # Pop the richest (which is the smallest negative number)
            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            results.append(richest)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

process_events()
```

### Explanation

- **Heap Operations**: We use `heapq.heappush` to add elements to the heap and `heapq.heappop` to remove the smallest element. By storing negative values, we effectively turn the min-heap into a max-heap.
- **Event Processing**: We iterate over each event, adding wealth to the heap or processing a king's visit by removing the richest citizen.
- **Output**: After processing all events, we print the wealth of each beheaded citizen in the order of the king's visits.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was efficiently managing a sequence of events involving citizens declaring their wealth and the king visiting to behead the richest citizen still alive. The challenge was to quickly identify and remove the richest citizen at each king's visit, which is a classic use case for a max-heap data structure.

### Key Concepts and Strategies:
- **Max-Heap Simulation**: Since Python's `heapq` module provides a min-heap, we simulated a max-heap by inserting negative values. This allowed us to efficiently retrieve and remove the largest wealth value.
- **Event Processing**: We processed each event in sequence, adding wealth to the heap or handling a king's visit by removing the richest citizen. This approach ensured that we maintained an up-to-date record of the richest citizens who had appeared so far.

### Code Snippet:
```python
import sys
import heapq

def process_events():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = int(data[1])
    
    events = data[2:]
    
    max_heap = []
    results = []
    
    for event in events:
        if event != '-1':
            wealth = int(event)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)
        else:
            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            results.append(richest)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

process_events()
```

This problem reinforced the utility of heaps for priority-based retrieval tasks and demonstrated how to adapt a min-heap to function as a max-heap using negative values. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without issues.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution was efficient and correct. However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights into alternative approaches:

1. **Data Structure Choice**: The official solution uses a simple list to store the wealth of citizens and iterates through it to find the richest citizen during each king's visit. This approach is less efficient than using a heap, especially for larger inputs, as it requires a linear scan to find the maximum wealth each time the king visits.

2. **Efficiency**: My solution leverages a max-heap (simulated using a min-heap with negative values) to efficiently track and retrieve the richest citizen. This reduces the time complexity of finding the richest citizen from O(N) per visit to O(log N), which is significant for large inputs.

3. **Simplicity vs. Performance**: The official solution is simpler in terms of implementation, as it avoids the complexity of managing a heap. However, this simplicity comes at the cost of performance, especially when the number of citizens and visits is large.

In summary, while the official solution is straightforward and easy to understand, my approach using a heap is more efficient for larger datasets. This exercise reinforces the importance of choosing the right data structure to optimize performance for specific problem constraints.

[description for function: process_events]
The function reads input from standard input, which includes two integers followed by a series of events, and processes these events using a max-heap. It first extracts the number of events and the number of queries, then iterates over the events. For e...,
