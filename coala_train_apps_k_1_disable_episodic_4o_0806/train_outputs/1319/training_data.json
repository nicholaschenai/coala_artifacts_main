    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was efficiently managing a sequence of events involving citizens declaring their wealth and the king visiting to behead the richest citizen still alive. The challenge was to quickly identify and remove the richest citizen at each king's visit, which is a classic use case for a max-heap data structure.\n\n### Key Concepts and Strategies:\n- **Max-Heap Simulation**: Since Python's `heapq` module provides a min-heap, we simulated a max-heap by inserting negative values. This allowed us to efficiently retrieve and remove the largest wealth value.\n- **Event Processing**: We processed each event in sequence, adding wealth to the heap or handling a king's visit by removing the richest citizen. This approach ensured that we maintained an up-to-date record of the richest citizens who had appeared so far.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef process_events():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    M = int(data[1])\n    \n    events = data[2:]\n    \n    max_heap = []\n    results = []\n    \n    for event in events:\n        if event != '-1':\n            wealth = int(event)\n            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)\n        else:\n            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)\n            results.append(richest)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nprocess_events()\n```\n\nThis problem reinforced the utility of heaps for priority-based retrieval tasks and demonstrated how to adapt a min-heap to function as a max-heap using negative values. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without issues.",
    "reflection": "The problem was straightforward, and my solution was efficient and correct. However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights into alternative approaches:\n\n1. **Data Structure Choice**: The official solution uses a simple list to store the wealth of citizens and iterates through it to find the richest citizen during each king's visit. This approach is less efficient than using a heap, especially for larger inputs, as it requires a linear scan to find the maximum wealth each time the king visits.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: My solution leverages a max-heap (simulated using a min-heap with negative values) to efficiently track and retrieve the richest citizen. This reduces the time complexity of finding the richest citizen from O(N) per visit to O(log N), which is significant for large inputs.\n\n3. **Simplicity vs. Performance**: The official solution is simpler in terms of implementation, as it avoids the complexity of managing a heap. However, this simplicity comes at the cost of performance, especially when the number of citizens and visits is large.\n\nIn summary, while the official solution is straightforward and easy to understand, my approach using a heap is more efficient for larger datasets. This exercise reinforces the importance of choosing the right data structure to optimize performance for specific problem constraints.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: process_events]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes two integers followed by a series of events, and processes these events using a max-heap. It first extracts the number of events and the number of queries, then iterates over the events. For each event, if the event is not '-1', it treats the event as a wealth value, converts it to an integer, and pushes its negative onto a heap to simulate a max-heap. If the event is '-1', it pops the largest wealth value from the heap (by popping the smallest negative number) and stores it in a results list. Finally, it prints each value in the results list, which represents the wealth values of the richest individuals at each query point.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to efficiently manage and retrieve the maximum element from a dynamic list of elements, especially when elements are being added and removed frequently. The use of a max-heap (simulated using a min-heap with negative values) is a common technique in computer science for such tasks. This is particularly relevant in real-time systems, priority queues, and scheduling problems where the highest priority task needs to be accessed quickly. Additionally, this approach is applicable in scenarios where you need to process a sequence of events with interleaved operations, such as handling a stream of data with periodic queries."
