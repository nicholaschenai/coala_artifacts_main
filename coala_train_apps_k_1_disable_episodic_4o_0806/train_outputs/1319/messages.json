He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.\nThe wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.\nThe king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family \u2026) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.\nSuppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is\n1376518911241376518911241\\; 3\\; 7\\; 6\\; 5\\; 18\\;  9\\; 11\\;  2\\; 4\nand the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.\nAt the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.\nYou may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.\nYour aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.\nThe next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nYour output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 10000$.\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$.\n- You may assume that in $50 \\%$ of the inputs $1 \\leq M \\leq 1000$ and $1 \\leq N \\leq 8000$.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n10 3\n1 \n3 \n7 \n6 \n-1 \n5 \n-1 \n18 \n9 \n11\n2\n-1\n4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n7\n6\n18\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each citizen's wealth is a unique positive integer, and a king's visit is denoted by `-1`. When the king visits, the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive is beheaded. We need to determine the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at each of the king's visits.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Data Structure Choice**: Use a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen who is still alive. A max-heap allows us to quickly retrieve and remove the largest element.\n\n2. **Processing Events**:\n   - For each citizen's wealth declaration, add the wealth to the max-heap.\n   - For each king's visit (`-1`), remove the richest citizen from the heap and record their wealth as they are beheaded.\n\n3. **Output**: For each king's visit, output the wealth of the beheaded citizen.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize an empty max-heap.\n2. For each event in the sequence:\n   - If the event is a positive integer (citizen's wealth), add it to the max-heap.\n   - If the event is `-1` (king's visit):\n     - Remove the maximum element from the heap (the richest citizen still alive).\n     - Record this wealth as the beheaded citizen's wealth.\n3. Print the recorded wealths for each king's visit.\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef process_events():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    M = int(data[1])\n    \n    events = data[2:]\n    \n    # Max-heap to store the wealth of citizens\n    max_heap = []\n    \n    # List to store the results of each king's visit\n    results = []\n    \n    for event in events:\n        if event == '-1':\n            # King visits, pop the richest citizen\n            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)\n            results.append(richest)\n        else:\n            # Citizen declares wealth, add to heap\n            wealth = int(event)\n            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)\n    \n    # Output the results for each king's visit\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We use a max-heap to keep track of the richest citizens. Python's `heapq` module provides a min-heap, so we store negative values to simulate a max-heap.\n- We read all input data at once and split it into a list of strings.\n- We iterate over each event:\n  - If it's a positive integer, we convert it to a negative and push it onto the heap.\n  - If it's `-1`, we pop the largest (most negative) value from the heap, convert it back to positive, and record it as the wealth of the beheaded citizen.\n- Finally, we print the wealth of the beheaded citizen for each king's visit."

The solution involved calculating cumulative scores for each player after each round and tracking the maximum lead and the player who achieved it.\n\n    **Core Concepts:**\n    - Cumulative scoring: Continuously updating scores for each player as the rounds progress.\n    - Lead calculation: Determining the difference between the two players' scores to find the lead.\n    - Maximum tracking: Keeping track of the maximum lead encountered and the player associated with it.\n\n    **Strategies and Fixes:**\n    - Initially, the function was defined but not called, which led to no output being generated. This was a key oversight that was corrected by explicitly calling the function at the end of the script.\n    - The input was read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is suitable for competitive programming environments where input is provided in bulk.

However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights into alternative approaches:\n\n1. **Data Structure Choice**: The official solution uses a simple list to store the wealth of citizens and iterates through it to find the richest citizen during each king's visit. This approach is less efficient than using a heap, especially for larger inputs, as it requires a linear scan to find the maximum wealth each time the king visits.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: My solution leverages a max-heap (simulated using a min-heap with negative values) to efficiently track and retrieve the richest citizen. This reduces the time complexity of finding the richest citizen from O(N) per visit to O(log N), which is significant for large inputs.\n\n3. **Simplicity vs. Performance**: The official solution is simpler in terms of implementation, as it avoids the complexity of managing a heap. However, this simplicity comes at the cost of performance, especially when the number of citizens and visits is large.\n\nIn summary, while the official solution is straightforward and easy to understand, my approach using a heap is more efficient for larger datasets.

It first extracts the number of events and the number of queries, then iterates over the events. For each event, if the event is not '-1', it treats the event as a wealth value, converts it to an integer, and pushes its negative onto a heap to simulate a max-heap. If the event is '-1', it pops the largest wealth value from the heap (by popping the smallest negative number) and stores it in a results list. Finally, it prints each value in the results list, which represents the wealth values of the richest individuals at each query point.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to efficiently manage and retrieve the maximum element from a dynamic list of elements, especially when elements are being added and removed frequently. The use of a max-heap (simulated using a min-heap with negative values) is a common technique in computer science for such tasks. This is particularly relevant in real-time systems, priority queues, and scheduling problems where the highest priority task needs to be accessed quickly. Additionally, this approach is applicable in scenarios where you need to process a sequence of events with interleaved operations, such as handling a stream of data with periodic queries."
