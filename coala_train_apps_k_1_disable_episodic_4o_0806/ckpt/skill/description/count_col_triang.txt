[description for function: count_col_triang]
The function takes a list of points, each associated with a color, and categorizes them by color. It then counts the number of non-collinear triangles that can be formed from points of the same color. For each color, it calculates the number of such triangles and keeps track of the total number of triangles across all colors. It identifies the color(s) with the maximum number of triangles and sorts them. Finally, it returns a list containing the total number of points, the number of distinct colors, the total number of triangles, and the color(s) with the maximum triangles along with the count of those triangles.

This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze geometric properties of points on a plane, particularly when dealing with problems involving collinearity and triangle formation. It is applicable in computational geometry, computer graphics, and spatial data analysis where determining the number of possible triangles from a set of points is necessary. This can be useful in applications such as geographic information systems (GIS), robotics (for path planning and obstacle avoidance), and in any system that requires spatial reasoning or pattern recognition. The method of checking collinearity using determinants is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and can be applied to various problems involving alignment and geometric configurations.
