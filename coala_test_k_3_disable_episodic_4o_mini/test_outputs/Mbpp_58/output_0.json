    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that checks if two given integers have opposite signs. This means that one integer should be positive and the other should be negative.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if two integers have opposite signs, we can check the product of the two integers. If the product is less than zero, it indicates that one integer is positive and the other is negative. If the product is zero or greater, they do not have opposite signs.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION opposite_Signs(a, b):\n       IF a * b < 0 THEN\n           RETURN True\n       ELSE\n           RETURN False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef opposite_Signs(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the product of a and b is less than zero\n    if a * b < 0:\n        return True  # They have opposite signs\n    else:\n        return False  # They do not have opposite signs\n```",
