The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.\n\n    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. \n\n    Key code snippet for counting divisors:\n    ```python\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved calculating the number of possible letter combinations that can be formed from a string of digits based on a traditional mobile keypad mapping. Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters, and the task was to compute the product of these counts for each digit in the input string, returning the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n    The core concept tested was the understanding of mapping digits to their respective letter counts and efficiently calculating the product of these counts. The solution involved using a dictionary to store the mappings and iterating through the input string to compute the total combinations.\n\n    The implemented solution was straightforward and effective, utilizing basic arithmetic and modular operations to handle potentially large numbers. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases successfully. The final code efficiently handled the constraints, including the maximum length of the input string and multiple test cases. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def count_combinations(S):\n        digit_to_count = {\n            '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3,\n            '7': 4, '8': 3, '9': 4\n        }\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        result = 1\n        for char in S:\n            result = (result * digit_to_count[char]) % MOD\n        return result\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mappings and modular arithmetic in combinatorial problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved calculating the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`, where the number of particles at time `t` is defined as `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. The solution required computing `N! * X` modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\). \n\n    Key insights included recognizing that for large values of `N` (up to \\(10^{18}\\)), directly calculating `N!` is impractical. Instead, I implemented a function to compute the factorial modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\), leveraging the fact that if `N` is greater than or equal to the modulus, the result would be zero due to the factorial containing the modulus as a factor.\n\n    The final implementation efficiently handled multiple test cases by reading input in bulk and processing each case in a loop. The results were stored and printed at once to optimize output performance. The code passed all provided test cases, confirming its correctness.\n\n    Here\u2019s the core function for calculating factorial modulo:\n\n    ```python\n    def factorial_mod(n, mod):\n        if n >= mod:\n            return 0\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            result = (result * i) % mod\n        return result\n    ```\n\n    The overall approach demonstrated effective use of modular arithmetic and efficient input/output handling for potentially large datasets.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
