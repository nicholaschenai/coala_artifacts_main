    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find the N'th polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The first few polite numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, etc. The goal is to write a function that returns the N'th polite number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the N'th polite number, we can generate polite numbers by checking each positive integer to see if it can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive integers. A number is not polite if it is a power of two. Therefore, we can iterate through positive integers, skipping those that are powers of two, and count how many polite numbers we have found until we reach the N'th one.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_power_of_two(x):\n       while x > 1:\n           if x is odd:\n               return false\n           x = x / 2\n       return true\n\n   function find_nth_polite_number(n):\n       count = 0\n       current_number = 1\n       while count < n:\n           if not is_power_of_two(current_number):\n               count += 1\n           current_number += 1\n       return current_number - 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two(x):\n    # Check if x is a power of two\n    while x > 1:\n        if x % 2 != 0:  # If x is odd and greater than 1, it's not a power of two\n            return False\n        x = x // 2  # Divide x by 2\n    return True  # If we reduce x to 1, it is a power of two\n\ndef is_polite(n: int) -> int:\n    count = 0  # Counter for polite numbers\n    current_number = 1  # Start checking from 1\n    while count < n:  # Continue until we find the N'th polite number\n        if not is_power_of_two(current_number):  # Check if current_number is not a power of two\n            count += 1  # Increment count of polite numbers\n        current_number += 1  # Move to the next number\n    return current_number - 1  # Return the last found polite number\n```",
