INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/284 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if all elements in a given list are equal to a specified element. If they are all equal, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each item in the list and compare it to the specified element. If we find any item that is not equal to the specified element, we can immediately return `False`. If we finish checking all items and they are all equal to the specified element, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION check_element(list, element):
       FOR each item in list:
           IF item is not equal to element:
               RETURN False
       RETURN True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function that checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element
def check_element(lst, element):
    # Iterate through each item in the list
    for item in lst:
        # If any item is not equal to the specified element, return False
        if item != element:
            return False
    # If all items are equal to the specified element, return True
    return True

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine if three adjacent sides of a cube were painted the same color based on given test cases. The solution involved checking specific combinations of adjacent sides for color matches. 

    The core concept tested was understanding the spatial relationships of a cube's sides and efficiently checking for color equality among them. The eight combinations of adjacent sides were identified and checked using simple conditional statements.

    The initial implementation was correct in logic but required clarity and adherence to the problem's constraints. The final solution efficiently processed each test case in constant time, leading to an overall complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases.

    Key code snippet for checking adjacent sides:
    ```python
    if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # front, left, top
        colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # front, right, top
        colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # front, left, bottom
        colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # front, right, bottom
        colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # back, left, top
        colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # back, right, top
        colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # back, left, bottom
        colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):    # back, right, bottom
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships in programming problems and the need for clear, efficient code.

    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

    In tackling the problem of determining if three adjacent sides of a cube are painted the same color, my initial approach was logically sound and correctly identified the necessary combinations of sides to check. However, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient implementation.

    **Key Insights from the Official Solution:**
    1. **Use of Indexing**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides directly. This approach simplifies the checking process by avoiding multiple conditional statements and instead iterating through predefined combinations.
  
    2. **Set for Uniqueness**: The official solution leverages the `set` data structure to check if all three colors are the same. By converting the list of colors to a set, it effectively checks for uniqueness in a single line, which is both elegant and efficient.

    3. **Control Flow**: The use of a counter (`c`) to track whether a match was found is straightforward, but the official solution could be further simplified by directly printing "YES" or "NO" based on the condition without needing an additional variable.

    **Comparison with My Approach**:
    - My solution explicitly checked each combination with multiple `or` conditions, which, while clear, could be seen as verbose compared to the official solution's use of a loop over a predefined list of combinations.
    - The official solution's use of `set` for checking color equality is a more Pythonic approach, reducing the complexity of the condition checks.

    ### Conclusion
    The official solution is more efficient in terms of readability and maintainability. It highlights the importance of leveraging built-in data structures and concise control flow in Python. In future problems, I will aim to adopt similar strategies to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining whether a set of matchsticks can form a square, I identified the key concepts of total length calculation and backtracking. The first step is to check if the total length of the matchsticks is divisible by 4, as this is a necessary condition for forming a square. If it is not, the function can immediately return false.

    The backtracking approach was effective in exploring combinations of matchsticks to build the four sides of the square. By sorting the matchsticks in descending order, I improved the efficiency of the backtracking process, as larger matchsticks are placed first, reducing the number of recursive calls needed.

    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach works well within the constraints given (length of matchstick array not exceeding 15). The code structure, with a helper function for backtracking, allowed for clear separation of logic and improved readability.

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    def backtrack(index):
        if index == len(nums):
            return all(side == side_length for side in sides)
        for i in range(4):
            if sides[i] + nums[index] <= side_length:
                sides[i] += nums[index]
                if backtrack(index + 1):
                    return True
                sides[i] -= nums[index]
            if sides[i] == 0:
                break
        return False
    ``` 

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of checking base conditions early and using backtracking for combinatorial problems.
