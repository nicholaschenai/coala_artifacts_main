    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to find the positions of the first and last occurrences of the specified character in the string. Once we have these positions, we can create a new string that excludes the characters at these positions. If the character does not exist in the string, we should return the string unchanged.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_Occ(s: string, char: string) -> string:\n       find the index of the first occurrence of char in s\n       find the index of the last occurrence of char in s\n       if char is not found in s:\n           return s\n       create a new string by excluding the characters at the found indices\n       return the new string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_first_occurrence(s, char):\n    # Find the index of the first occurrence of char in s\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == char:\n            return i\n    return -1  # Return -1 if char is not found\n\ndef find_last_occurrence(s, char):\n    # Find the index of the last occurrence of char in s\n    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == char:\n            return i\n    return -1  # Return -1 if char is not found\n\ndef remove_Occ(s: str, char: str) -> str:\n    # Get the first and last occurrence indices\n    first_index = find_first_occurrence(s, char)\n    last_index = find_last_occurrence(s, char)\n    \n    # If the character is not found, return the original string\n    if first_index == -1:\n        return s\n    \n    # Create a new string excluding the first and last occurrences\n    new_string = s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]\n    return new_string\n```",
