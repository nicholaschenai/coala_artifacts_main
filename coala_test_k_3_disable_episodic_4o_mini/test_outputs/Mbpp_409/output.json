    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find the minimum product of pairs of numbers from a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers, and we need to calculate the product of the two integers in each tuple, then return the smallest product found.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We will iterate through each tuple in the list, calculate the product of the two integers in the tuple, and keep track of the minimum product encountered. At the end of the iteration, we will return the minimum product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_product_tuple(tuples):\n       initialize min_product to a very large number\n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           calculate the product of the two numbers in the tuple\n           if the product is less than min_product:\n               update min_product\n       return min_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_product_tuple(tuples):\n    # Initialize min_product to a very large number\n    min_product = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for a, b in tuples:\n        # Calculate the product of the two numbers in the tuple\n        product = a * b\n        \n        # Update min_product if the current product is smaller\n        if product < min_product:\n            min_product = product\n            \n    # Return the minimum product found\n    return min_product\n```",
