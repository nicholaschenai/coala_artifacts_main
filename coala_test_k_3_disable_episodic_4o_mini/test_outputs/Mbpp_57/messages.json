The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.\n\n    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.\n\n    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def largest_prime_factor(n):\n        largest_prime = 1\n        while n % 2 == 0:\n            largest_prime = 2\n            n //= 2\n        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n            while n % i == 0:\n                largest_prime = i\n                n //= i\n        if n > 2:\n            largest_prime = n\n        return largest_prime\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        index = 1\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n            index += 1\n        \n            prime_count = {}\n        \n            for number in elements:\n                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)\n                if largest_prime in prime_count:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1\n                else:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1\n        \n            max_count = -1\n            result_prime = -1\n        \n            for prime, count in prime_count.items():\n                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result_prime):\n                    max_count = count\n                    result_prime = prime\n        \n            results.append(result_prime)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted array of integers. The solution utilized a dynamic programming approach, which is a common strategy for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index, updating it based on previous elements.\n\n    The implemented algorithm iterated through the input array, comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length of the subsequence was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by taking the maximum value from the array that tracked the lengths.\n\n    The code snippet for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            d = [1] * len(nums)\n        \n            for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This approach runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem constraints. The solution was successful, passing all tests, indicating that the dynamic programming strategy was effective in this case. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\n    The official solution provided a more efficient and concise approach to converting a number to a specified base, particularly with the handling of both integer and fractional parts. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Use of Mathematical Functions**: The official solution utilizes the `log` function to determine the maximum power of the base that fits into the number. This is a more efficient way to handle the conversion compared to repeatedly dividing the number.\n\n    2. **Handling of Digits**: The solution uses a predefined string `DIGS` to map numeric values to their corresponding characters for bases greater than 10. This simplifies the conversion process and avoids the need for conditional checks during digit conversion.\n\n    3. **Efficient Looping**: The loop iterates over a range that includes both the fractional and integer parts, allowing for a single pass to build the result string. This contrasts with my approach, which separated the integer and fractional conversions into different sections.\n\n    4. **Negative Numbers**: The solution handles negative numbers by prepending a '-' sign based on the condition of `n`, which is a clean and effective way to manage the sign.\n\n    5. **Output Formatting**: The official solution constructs the output string in a single list and joins it at the end, which is generally more efficient than concatenating strings directly.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways\n    - Using mathematical properties (like logarithms) can simplify the problem and improve performance.\n    - Predefined mappings for digits can streamline the conversion process.\n    - Combining the handling of integer and fractional parts into a single loop can reduce complexity and improve readability.\n    - Efficient string construction techniques (like using lists) can enhance performance in Python.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is more elegant and efficient than my initial attempts, highlighting the importance of leveraging mathematical insights and efficient data structures in programming challenges.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
