    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the smallest list among those lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each list in the main list, check the length of each sublist, and keep track of the smallest length we encounter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the smallest length found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function Find_Min_Length(lists):\n       initialize min_length to a large number\n       for each sublist in lists:\n           if length of sublist is less than min_length:\n               update min_length to the length of sublist\n       return min_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(lists):\n    # Initialize min_length to a large number\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in lists:\n        # Update min_length if the current sublist is shorter\n        if len(sublist) < min_length:\n            min_length = len(sublist)\n    \n    # Return the smallest length found\n    return min_length\n```",
