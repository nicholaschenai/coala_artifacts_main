    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the last digit of the factorial of a given number. For example, if the input is 4, the output should be 4 because 4! (which is 24) has a last digit of 4.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the last digit of the factorial of a number, we can compute the factorial by multiplying all integers from 1 to that number. After calculating the factorial, we can simply take the last digit of the result. However, we can optimize this by only keeping track of the last digit during the multiplication process, which avoids handling large numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n       if n is 0 or n is 1:\n           return 1  # 0! and 1! both equal 1\n       last_digit = 1\n       for i from 2 to n:\n           last_digit = (last_digit * i) % 10  # Keep only the last digit\n       return last_digit\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n    # Handle the base case where n is 0 or 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1  # 0! and 1! both equal 1\n    \n    last_digit = 1  # Initialize last_digit to 1\n    # Loop through all numbers from 2 to n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        last_digit = (last_digit * i) % 10  # Update last_digit to keep only the last digit\n    \n    return last_digit  # Return the last digit of n!\n```",
