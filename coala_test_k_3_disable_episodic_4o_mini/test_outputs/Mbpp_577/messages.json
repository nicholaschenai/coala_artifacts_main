The key insight was recognizing that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to the Pisano period. This allowed for efficient computation even for very large values of N (up to 10^18).\n\n    The solution was structured into three main functions: one to compute the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using the Pisano period, another to determine the last remaining number after the removal process, and a final function to handle input and output. The approach of reducing N by half in each iteration of the removal process was effective, as it directly correlated with the position in the last digits array.\n\n    The final implementation passed the provided test cases successfully, demonstrating that the strategy of leveraging the periodicity of Fibonacci last digits was both efficient and effective. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The solution is useful for similar problems involving sequences and periodicity. \n\n    Key code snippets:\n    ```python\n    def last_digit_fibonacci(n):\n        # Calculate the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using Pisano period\n        ...\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(n):\n        # Find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements\n        ...\n\n    def solve():\n        # Handle input and output\n        ...\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved calculating the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`, where the number of particles at time `t` is defined as `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. The solution required computing `N! * X` modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\). \n\n    Key insights included recognizing that for large values of `N` (up to \\(10^{18}\\)), directly calculating `N!` is impractical. Instead, I implemented a function to compute the factorial modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\), leveraging the fact that if `N` is greater than or equal to the modulus, the result would be zero due to the factorial containing the modulus as a factor.\n\n    The final implementation efficiently handled multiple test cases by reading input in bulk and processing each case in a loop. The results were stored and printed at once to optimize output performance. The code passed all provided test cases, confirming its correctness.\n\n    Here\u2019s the core function for calculating factorial modulo:\n\n    ```python\n    def factorial_mod(n, mod):\n        if n >= mod:\n            return 0\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            result = (result * i) % mod\n        return result\n    ```\n\n    The overall approach demonstrated effective use of modular arithmetic and efficient input/output handling for potentially large datasets.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
