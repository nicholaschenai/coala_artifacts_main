    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that finds all numbers within a specified range (from `startnum` to `endnum`) such that each number is divisible by each of its digits. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the given range. For each number, we will check its digits. If any digit is zero, we skip that number since division by zero is undefined. For non-zero digits, we will check if the number is divisible by each digit. If it is divisible by all its digits, we will add it to our result list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):\n       create an empty list result\n       for number from startnum to endnum:\n           convert number to string to access digits\n           set divisible to true\n           for each digit in the string representation of number:\n               if digit is '0':\n                   set divisible to false\n                   break\n               if number % int(digit) != 0:\n                   set divisible to false\n                   break\n           if divisible is true:\n               append number to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the specified range\n    for number in range(startnum, endnum + 1):\n        # Convert the number to string to access its digits\n        str_number = str(number)\n        divisible = True  # Assume the number is divisible by its digits\n        \n        # Check each digit in the number\n        for digit in str_number:\n            if digit == '0':  # If the digit is zero, skip this number\n                divisible = False\n                break\n            if number % int(digit) != 0:  # Check divisibility\n                divisible = False\n                break\n        \n        # If the number is divisible by all its digits, add it to the result\n        if divisible:\n            result.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of valid numbers\n    return result\n```",
