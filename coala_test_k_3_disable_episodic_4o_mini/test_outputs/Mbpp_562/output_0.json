    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of lists (sublists) and returns the length of the longest sublist within that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each sublist in the main list, check the length of each sublist, and keep track of the maximum length found. At the end of the iteration, we will return the maximum length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function Find_Max_Length(sublists):\n       initialize max_length to 0\n       for each sublist in sublists:\n           if length of sublist is greater than max_length:\n               update max_length to length of sublist\n       return max_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef Find_Max_Length(sublists):\n    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the provided list of sublists\n    for sublist in sublists:\n        # Check if the length of the current sublist is greater than the max_length found so far\n        if len(sublist) > max_length:\n            # Update max_length to the length of the current sublist\n            max_length = len(sublist)\n    \n    # Return the maximum length found\n    return max_length\n```",
