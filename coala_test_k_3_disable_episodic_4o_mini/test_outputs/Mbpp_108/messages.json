The goal was to accumulate scores for each team based on their submissions while ensuring that teams with the same character composition were treated as identical.\n\n    The initial approach involved using a normalized version of the team names (sorted characters) as keys in a dictionary to accumulate scores. However, this led to the loss of the original team names, which was crucial for the final output. The output format required the original team names to be printed alongside their scores, sorted by score and then lexicographically by name.\n\n    The solution was refined by storing tuples in the dictionary that included both the original team name and the accumulated score. This allowed for proper retrieval and sorting of results. The final implementation successfully passed all tests by ensuring that the output matched the expected format.\n\n    Key takeaways:\n    - Always retain necessary information (like original names) when normalizing data for processing.\n    - Sorting and output formatting are critical in competitive programming problems, especially when multiple criteria are involved. \n\n    Final working code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n            index += 1\n        \n            scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n            # Process first half hour submissions\n            for _ in range(R):\n                line = data[index].split()\n                team_name = line[0]\n                points = int(line[1])\n                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n                if normalized_name not in scores:\n                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)\n                index += 1\n        \n            # Process remaining submissions\n            for _ in range(N - R):\n                line = data[index].split()\n                team_name = line[0]\n                points = int(line[1])\n                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n                if normalized_name not in scores:\n                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)\n                index += 1\n        \n            # Prepare result for sorting\n            result = [(name, score) for normalized_name, (name, score) in scores.items()]\n            # Sort by score (descending) and then by team name (lexicographical)\n            result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n            # Print the results\n            for team_name, score in result:\n                print(team_name, score)\n\n    # Call the main function to execute the code\n    main()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to determine the difficulty of contest problems based on their subtasks, which involved calculating how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask decreased as we sorted the subtasks by score. The solution involved reading input data, processing it to count the decreases, and then sorting the problems based on their difficulty.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate and sort data structures effectively. I utilized tuples to store the difficulty of each problem and sorted them based on the defined criteria. The approach of pairing scores with the number of contestants and sorting them was straightforward and effective.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, and the code passed all tests without any errors. The key takeaway was the importance of careful data handling and sorting, especially when dealing with multiple criteria for comparison. The solution was efficient given the constraints, and I learned that maintaining clarity in the logic flow is crucial for solving such problems. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def main():\n        P, S = map(int, input().split())\n        difficulties = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, P + 1):\n            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))\n        \n            n = 0\n            for k in range(1, S):\n                if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:\n                    n += 1\n        \n            difficulties.append((n, i))\n    \n        difficulties.sort()\n    \n        for difficulty in difficulties:\n            print(difficulty[1])\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding sorting and counting mechanisms in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I implemented a machine called ANGEN that performs various operations on a list of integers, including updates, sum, maximum, minimum, second maximum, and second minimum queries. The core concepts involved understanding how to manipulate a list based on user input and efficiently compute results for different types of queries.\n\n    The solution involved defining helper functions to find the second maximum and second minimum values, which required handling unique values and sorting. The main function processed input queries, updating the list or calculating results based on the specified operation type. I ensured to handle edge cases, such as when there are not enough unique values for second max/min queries, returning \"NA\" when necessary.\n\n    The implementation was straightforward, and all operations were executed in a linear manner, which is acceptable given the constraints. The code passed all provided test cases, indicating that the logic was sound and the operations were correctly implemented. Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of clear input handling and efficient list operations in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
