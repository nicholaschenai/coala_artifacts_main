    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that finds the maximum product of numbers from an increasing subsequence in a given list of integers. An increasing subsequence is a sequence where each number is greater than the one before it.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain an array that keeps track of the maximum product that can be obtained by including each element in the increasing subsequence. For each element in the array, we will check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we will calculate the product and update our maximum product array accordingly.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_product(arr):\n       if arr is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       n = length of arr\n       max_product_array = array of size n initialized to 1\n       \n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   max_product_array[i] = max(max_product_array[i], max_product_array[j] * arr[i])\n       \n       return max value in max_product_array\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    # Check if the input array is empty\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    n = len(arr)\n    # Initialize an array to store the maximum product for each element\n    max_product_array = [1] * n\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the array\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Check all previous elements to find increasing subsequences\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:  # If arr[j] is less than arr[i], we can form an increasing subsequence\n                # Update the maximum product for arr[i]\n                max_product_array[i] = max(max_product_array[i], max_product_array[j] * arr[i])\n    \n    # Return the maximum value found in the max_product_array\n    return max(max_product_array)\n```",
