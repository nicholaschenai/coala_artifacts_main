[Summary]:
    The problem involved finding the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, specifically after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements. The key insight was recognizing that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to the Pisano period. This allowed for efficient computation even for very large values of N (up to 10^18).

    The solution was structured into three main functions: one to compute the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using the Pisano period, another to determine the last remaining number after the removal process, and a final function to handle input and output. The approach of reducing N by half in each iteration of the removal process was effective, as it directly correlated with the position in the last digits array.

    The final implementation passed the provided test cases successfully, demonstrating that the strategy of leveraging the periodicity of Fibonacci last digits was both efficient and effective. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The solution is useful for similar problems involving sequences and periodicity. 

    Key code snippets:
    ```python
    def last_digit_fibonacci(n):
        # Calculate the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using Pisano period
        ...

    def find_last_remaining_number(n):
        # Find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements
        ...

    def solve():
        # Handle input and output
        ...
    ```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I implemented a solution to find the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concept involved identifying the rightmost ascent in the permutation, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.

    The implementation followed a clear structure: a helper function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution successfully handled multiple permutations as specified in the problem statement.

    One key takeaway is the importance of understanding the mechanics of generating permutations, particularly the lexicographic order. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. The code was tested against sample inputs, and it produced the expected outputs, confirming its correctness. 

    Here’s the essential code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def next_permutation(arr):
        i = len(arr) - 2
        while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:
            i -= 1
        if i == -1:
            arr.reverse()
            return arr
        j = len(arr) - 1
        while arr[j] <= arr[i]:
            j -= 1
        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])
        return arr

    def main():
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        results = []
        for _ in range(K):
            permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))
            next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, next_perm)))
        print("\n".join(results))

    main()
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the solution's structure, which can be useful for similar tasks in the future.
