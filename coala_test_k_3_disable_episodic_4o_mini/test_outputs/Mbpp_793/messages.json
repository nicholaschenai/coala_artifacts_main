The key insight was recognizing that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to the Pisano period. This allowed for efficient computation even for very large values of N (up to 10^18).\n\n    The solution was structured into three main functions: one to compute the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using the Pisano period, another to determine the last remaining number after the removal process, and a final function to handle input and output. The approach of reducing N by half in each iteration of the removal process was effective, as it directly correlated with the position in the last digits array.\n\n    The final implementation passed the provided test cases successfully, demonstrating that the strategy of leveraging the periodicity of Fibonacci last digits was both efficient and effective. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The solution is useful for similar problems involving sequences and periodicity. \n\n    Key code snippets:\n    ```python\n    def last_digit_fibonacci(n):\n        # Calculate the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using Pisano period\n        ...\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(n):\n        # Find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements\n        ...\n\n    def solve():\n        # Handle input and output\n        ...\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum at least \\( K \\). The solution involved using a sliding window technique combined with prefix sums to efficiently track the sums of subarrays.\n\n    The core concept was to maintain a running sum while iterating through the array. By calculating prefix sums, we could quickly determine the sum of any subarray. The strategy involved expanding the right pointer to include more elements and contracting the left pointer to minimize the length of valid subarrays when the sum condition was met.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the requirements and passed the provided test cases. The use of prefix sums allowed for efficient sum calculations, and the sliding window approach ensured that we explored all potential subarrays without unnecessary recalculations. This method proved effective for the problem constraints, demonstrating a clear pattern for solving similar problems involving subarray sums. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def shortestSubarray(self, A: list[int], K: int) -> int:\n            n = len(A)\n            min_length = float('inf')  # Initialize minimum length as infinity\n            current_sum = 0  # Initialize current sum\n            left = 0  # Initialize left pointer\n            prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)  # Create a prefix sum array\n\n            # Calculate prefix sums\n            for i in range(n):\n                prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + A[i]\n\n            # Iterate through the prefix sums\n            for right in range(1, n + 1):\n                current_sum = prefix_sums[right]  # Current sum is the prefix sum at right\n            \n                # Check if we can find a valid subarray\n                while left < right and current_sum - prefix_sums[left] >= K:\n                    min_length = min(min_length, right - left)  # Update minimum length\n                    left += 1  # Move left pointer to the right\n\n            # Return the result\n            return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding prefix sums and sliding window techniques for efficiently solving subarray problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution employs a more efficient approach to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) using a combination of dynamic programming and binary search, achieving a time complexity of O(n log n). This is a significant improvement over the O(n^2) complexity of my initial solution.\n\n    Key insights from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns 0. It initializes a list `res` to keep track of the smallest tail values of increasing subsequences found so far.\n\n    2. **Binary Search**: A helper function `binarySearch` is defined to find the position in the `res` list where the current number should be placed. This function uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the correct index, ensuring that the `res` list remains sorted.\n\n    3. **Iterating through the input**: The solution iterates through the input list starting from the second element. If the current number is greater than the last element in `res`, it appends the number to `res`. Otherwise, it uses the `binarySearch` function to find the appropriate index to replace an existing value in `res`, maintaining the property of the smallest tail values.\n\n    4. **Final Result**: The length of the `res` list at the end of the iteration represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    The official solution is more efficient because it reduces the number of comparisons needed to maintain the increasing subsequence, leveraging the sorted nature of the `res` list and the logarithmic time complexity of binary search. This approach is particularly useful for larger datasets where performance is critical. \n\n    In contrast, my initial solution, while correct, was less efficient due to the nested loops that resulted in a quadratic time complexity. This experience highlights the importance of considering different algorithmic strategies, especially when dealing with problems that can be optimized through data structures like lists and search algorithms.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
