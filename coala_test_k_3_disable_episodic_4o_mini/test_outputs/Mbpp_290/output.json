    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find the longest list within a list of lists and return its length along with the list itself.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We will iterate through each sublist in the main list, checking the length of each sublist. We will keep track of the maximum length found and the corresponding sublist. At the end of the iteration, we will return the maximum length and the sublist that has this length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_length(lists):\n       initialize max_length to 0\n       initialize max_list to empty list\n       \n       for each sublist in lists:\n           if length of sublist is greater than max_length:\n               update max_length to length of sublist\n               update max_list to sublist\n       \n       return (max_length, max_list)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_length(lists):\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum length and the corresponding list\n    max_length = 0\n    max_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the provided list of lists\n    for sublist in lists:\n        # Check if the current sublist is longer than the maximum found so far\n        if len(sublist) > max_length:\n            # Update the maximum length and the corresponding list\n            max_length = len(sublist)\n            max_list = sublist\n            \n    # Return the maximum length and the list that has this length\n    return (max_length, max_list)\n```",
