    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order. The function should take a list as input and return a new list that contains the same numbers but arranged from the smallest to the largest.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To sort the list, we can use a sorting algorithm. One effective method is the Comb Sort algorithm, which improves upon the traditional Bubble Sort by using a gap to compare elements that are farther apart. The algorithm repeatedly reduces the gap and performs swaps until the list is sorted.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function comb_sort(arr):\n       set gap to length of arr divided by 1.3\n       set swapped to true\n       while swapped is true:\n           set swapped to false\n           for i from 0 to length of arr - gap:\n               if arr[i] > arr[i + gap]:\n                   swap arr[i] and arr[i + gap]\n                   set swapped to true\n           if gap is greater than 1:\n               reduce gap by dividing it by 1.3\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef comb_sort(arr):\n    # Set the initial gap size\n    gap = len(arr) // 1.3\n    swapped = True\n    \n    # Continue sorting until no swaps are made\n    while swapped:\n        swapped = False\n        \n        # Compare elements with the current gap\n        for i in range(len(arr) - int(gap)):\n            if arr[i] > arr[i + int(gap)]:\n                # Swap if elements are in the wrong order\n                arr[i], arr[i + int(gap)] = arr[i + int(gap)], arr[i]\n                swapped = True\n        \n        # Reduce the gap size\n        if gap > 1:\n            gap /= 1.3\n            \n    return arr\n\n# The function comb_sort is declared last as per instructions.\n```",
