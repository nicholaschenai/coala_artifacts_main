INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/238 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that counts how many non-empty substrings can be formed from a given string. A substring is any sequence of characters that appears in the string, and it can be of any length from 1 to the length of the string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the number of non-empty substrings, we can use the fact that for a string of length `n`, the number of non-empty substrings can be calculated using the formula: 
   - For each character in the string, it can start a substring that can extend to the end of the string. 
   - Therefore, the first character can start `n` substrings, the second character can start `n-1` substrings, and so on, until the last character which can start 1 substring. 
   - The total number of non-empty substrings is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is given by the formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function number_of_substrings(s: string) -> int:
       n = length of s
       return n * (n + 1) / 2
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def number_of_substrings(s: str) -> int:
    # Calculate the length of the string
    n = len(s)
    # Use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers to find the count of non-empty substrings
    return n * (n + 1) // 2  # Use integer division to ensure the result is an integer

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the input string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the string is processed until no "abc" substrings remain.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count("abc")` to check for occurrences, which simplifies the condition for the while loop. In my initial solution, I used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit in terms of counting occurrences. The official solution's method is more efficient in that it directly removes all instances of "abc" in one operation, rather than removing them one at a time.

    Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively, making it both easy to read and efficient. In future implementations, I should consider using similar built-in methods for string manipulation to enhance clarity and performance.

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

[Reflection]:
    The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to remove a contiguous subsequence from an array while ensuring the remaining sequence is strictly increasing. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

    1. **Preprocessing for Non-Decreasing Prefix**:
       - The function `pre(a)` identifies the last index `p` where the sequence stops being strictly increasing from the left. This means that all elements from the start of the array up to index `p` are non-decreasing.

    2. **Preprocessing for Non-Increasing Suffix**:
       - The function `suf(a)` finds the first index `s` from the right where the sequence stops being strictly increasing. This means that all elements from index `s` to the end of the array are non-increasing.

    3. **Using Binary Search**:
       - The solution uses the `bisect` module to efficiently find the position in the suffix where elements can be inserted while maintaining order. This allows for quick counting of valid remaining sequences after removing a subsequence.

    4. **Counting Valid Configurations**:
       - The count of valid configurations is calculated based on the indices found by `pre` and `suf`. The total number of ways to remove subsequences is derived from the positions of the elements in the remaining sequence.

    5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
       - The solution also accounts for edge cases, such as when the entire sequence is non-increasing, by calculating the total number of contiguous subsequences and subtracting the empty case.

    This approach is significantly more efficient than the brute-force method I initially proposed, which involved checking all possible subsequences and their resulting sequences. The official solution reduces the complexity by leveraging preprocessing and binary search, making it suitable for larger input sizes as specified in the problem constraints. 

    In summary, the official solution's use of preprocessing to identify critical indices and binary search for counting valid configurations provides a clear advantage in both time and space complexity, making it a more effective solution to the problem.
