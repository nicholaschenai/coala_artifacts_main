    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that counts all the non-empty substrings of a given string. For example, for the string \"abc\", the non-empty substrings are \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"ab\", \"bc\", and \"abc\", totaling six substrings.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To count the non-empty substrings of a string, we can use a systematic approach. For a string of length `n`, each character can start a substring, and we can extend that substring to include subsequent characters. The number of substrings that can be formed starting from each character can be calculated as follows:\n   - The first character can form `n` substrings (including itself and all combinations with subsequent characters).\n   - The second character can form `n-1` substrings, and so on.\n   - Therefore, the total number of non-empty substrings can be calculated using the formula: `n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1`, which simplifies to `n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function number_of_substrings(s):\n       n = length of s\n       total_substrings = n * (n + 1) / 2\n       return total_substrings\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(s: str) -> int:\n    # Calculate the length of the string\n    n = len(s)\n    # Use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers to find the total substrings\n    total_substrings = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    # Return the total count of non-empty substrings\n    return total_substrings\n```",
