INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/557 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and changes each character's case. If a character is uppercase, it should be converted to lowercase, and if it is lowercase, it should be converted to uppercase.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We can iterate through each character in the string. For each character, we will check if it is uppercase or lowercase. If it is uppercase, we will convert it to lowercase, and if it is lowercase, we will convert it to uppercase. We will then collect all the modified characters and join them back into a single string to return the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function toggle_string(input_string):
       create an empty list to hold the toggled characters
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is uppercase:
               convert it to lowercase and add to the list
           else if character is lowercase:
               convert it to uppercase and add to the list
           else:
               add the character as is to the list
       join the list into a single string
       return the new string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def toggle_string(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty list to hold the toggled characters
    toggled_chars = []

        elif char.islower():
            # Convert it to uppercase and add to the list
            toggled_chars.append(char.upper())
        else:
            # Add the character as is to the list (for non-alphabetic characters)
            toggled_chars.append(char)

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ```

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to rearrange a string of appetizers based on their binary indices when read upside down. The key concepts involved binary number manipulation, string reversal, and indexing. The problem required converting indices to binary, reversing those binary strings, and then converting them back to decimal to determine the new positions of the appetizers.

    The solution involved iterating through each test case, calculating the number of appetizers as `2^k`, and then for each index, performing the necessary conversions and rearrangements. The final arrangement was constructed in a list and printed as a string.

    The code was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The main operations included formatting numbers to binary, reversing strings, and converting between binary and decimal, which were efficiently implemented using Python's built-in functions. The solution passed all test cases without errors, indicating that the approach was effective and correctly addressed the problem's requirements. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def rearrange_appetizers(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            k, appetizers_string = case.split()
            k = int(k)
            n = 2 ** k
            result = [''] * n
        
            for i in range(n):
                binary_index = format(i, '0' + str(k) + 'b')
                reversed_index = binary_index[::-1]
                new_index = int(reversed_index, 2)
                result[new_index] = appetizers_string[i]
        
            print(''.join(result))

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    rearrange_appetizers(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the final solution, which can be referenced for similar tasks in the future.

   The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and changes the case of each character in that string. For example, if the input is "Python", the output should be "pYTHON", where all uppercase letters are converted to lowercase and all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase.
