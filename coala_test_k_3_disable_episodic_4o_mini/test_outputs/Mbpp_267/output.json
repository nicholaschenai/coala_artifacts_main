    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes an integer `n` and calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the first two odd natural numbers are 1 and 3, and their squares are 1^2 = 1 and 3^2 = 9, which sum to 10.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to identify the first `n` odd natural numbers. The sequence of odd natural numbers starts at 1 and increases by 2 for each subsequent number (1, 3, 5, 7, ...). We can calculate the square of each of these numbers and keep a running total until we have processed `n` numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function square_Sum(n):\n       initialize total to 0\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           odd_number = 2 * i + 1  // Calculate the i-th odd number\n           total += odd_number^2    // Add the square of the odd number to total\n       return total\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    # Initialize total to accumulate the sum of squares\n    total = 0\n    # Loop through the first n odd natural numbers\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Calculate the i-th odd number\n        odd_number = 2 * i + 1\n        # Add the square of the odd number to total\n        total += odd_number * odd_number\n    # Return the final total\n    return total\n```",
