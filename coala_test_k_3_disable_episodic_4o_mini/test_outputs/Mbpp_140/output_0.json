    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples (where each tuple contains numbers) and flattens it into a single set of unique numbers. The output should be a set that contains all the distinct numbers from the input tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we will iterate through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, we will iterate through its elements and add them to a set. Using a set will automatically handle duplicates, ensuring that each number is only included once in the final output.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function extract_singly(list_of_tuples):\n       create an empty set called unique_numbers\n       for each tuple in list_of_tuples:\n           for each number in the tuple:\n               add number to unique_numbers\n       return unique_numbers\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef extract_singly(list_of_tuples):\n    # Create an empty set to store unique numbers\n    unique_numbers = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for tup in list_of_tuples:\n        # Iterate through each number in the tuple\n        for number in tup:\n            # Add the number to the set (duplicates will be ignored)\n            unique_numbers.add(number)\n    \n    # Return the set of unique numbers\n    return unique_numbers\n```",
