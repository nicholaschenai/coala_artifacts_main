    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that sorts a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple. Each tuple contains a subject name and a corresponding score. The output should be a list of these tuples sorted in ascending order of the scores.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to take the list of tuples and sort them. We can use the built-in sorting functionality in Python, which allows us to specify a key for sorting. In this case, the key will be the second element of each tuple (the score). After sorting, we will return the sorted list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function subject_marks(marks):\n       sort marks by the second element of each tuple\n       return sorted marks\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef subject_marks(marks):\n    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple\n    sorted_marks = sorted(marks, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    # Return the sorted list\n    return sorted_marks\n\n# The function is now defined and can be used to sort subject marks.\n```",
