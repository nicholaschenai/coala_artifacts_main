The solution involved reading input data, processing it to count the decreases, and then sorting the problems based on their difficulty.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate and sort data structures effectively. I utilized tuples to store the difficulty of each problem and sorted them based on the defined criteria. The approach of pairing scores with the number of contestants and sorting them was straightforward and effective.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, and the code passed all tests without any errors. The key takeaway was the importance of careful data handling and sorting, especially when dealing with multiple criteria for comparison. The solution was efficient given the constraints, and I learned that maintaining clarity in the logic flow is crucial for solving such problems. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def main():\n        P, S = map(int, input().split())\n        difficulties = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, P + 1):\n            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))\n        \n            n = 0\n            for k in range(1, S):\n                if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:\n                    n += 1\n        \n            difficulties.append((n, i))\n    \n        difficulties.sort()\n    \n        for difficulty in difficulties:\n            print(difficulty[1])\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding sorting and counting mechanisms in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\n    In tackling the problem of accumulating scores for programming competition teams with scrambled names, my initial approach involved normalizing team names by sorting their characters and using a dictionary to store scores. While this method was fundamentally sound, it had a few shortcomings that I learned from.\n\n    The official solution effectively uses a similar normalization strategy but optimizes the process by maintaining a list of tuples that directly associates the original team names with their scores. This allows for efficient updates and retrievals without losing the original names. The key steps in the official solution include:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and the number of submissions efficiently.\n    2. **Score Accumulation**: It uses a list to store scores and normalized names, allowing for direct access and updates when processing submissions.\n    3. **Sorting and Output**: After accumulating scores, it sorts the list based on scores and outputs the results in the required format.\n\n    One of the main insights from the official solution is the use of a list to store both the score and the original team name, which simplifies the process of updating scores and ensures that the original names are preserved for output. This contrasts with my initial implementation, where I lost track of the original names by using normalized names as dictionary keys.\n\n    Additionally, the official solution's approach to sorting and outputting results is straightforward and efficient, ensuring that the final output meets the problem's requirements without unnecessary complexity.\n\n    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of maintaining data integrity (in this case, preserving original names) while processing and accumulating results, as well as the value of efficient data structures for managing updates and retrievals.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the main challenge was to correctly handle team names that could be presented in any order due to character rearrangement. The goal was to accumulate scores for each team based on their submissions while ensuring that teams with the same character composition were treated as identical.\n\n    The initial approach involved using a normalized version of the team names (sorted characters) as keys in a dictionary to accumulate scores. However, this led to the loss of the original team names, which was crucial for the final output. The output format required the original team names to be printed alongside their scores, sorted by score and then lexicographically by name.\n\n    The solution was refined by storing tuples in the dictionary that included both the original team name and the accumulated score. This allowed for proper retrieval and sorting of results. The final implementation successfully passed all tests by ensuring that the output matched the expected format.\n\n    Key takeaways:\n    - Always retain necessary information (like original names) when normalizing data for processing.\n    - Sorting and output formatting are critical in competitive programming problems, especially when multiple criteria are involved. \n\n    Final working code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n            index += 1\n        \n            scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n            # Process first half hour submissions\n            for _ in range(R):\n                line = data[index].split()\n                team_name = line[0]\n                points = int(line[1])\n                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n                if normalized_name not in scores:\n                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)\n                index += 1\n        \n            # Process remaining submissions\n            for _ in range(N - R):\n                line = data[index].split()\n                team_name = line[0]\n                points = int(line[1])\n                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n                if normalized_name not in scores:\n                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)\n                index += 1\n        \n            # Prepare result for sorting\n            result = [(name, score) for normalized_name, (name, score) in scores.items()]\n            # Sort by score (descending) and then by team name (lexicographical)\n            result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n            # Print the results\n            for team_name, score in result:\n                print(team_name, score)\n\n    # Call the main function to execute the code\n    main()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
