    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that finds the largest products formed by multiplying elements from two different lists. Specifically, we need to find the top N largest products, where each product is formed by taking one element from the first list and one from the second list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Generate all possible products by multiplying each element from the first list with each element from the second list.\n   - Store these products in a list.\n   - Sort the list of products in descending order.\n   - Select the top N products from this sorted list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function large_product(list1, list2, N):\n       products = empty list\n       for each element x in list1:\n           for each element y in list2:\n               product = x * y\n               add product to products\n       sort products in descending order\n       return the first N elements of products\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef large_product(list1, list2, N):\n    # Step 1: Initialize an empty list to store products\n    products = []\n    \n    # Step 2: Generate all possible products\n    for x in list1:\n        for y in list2:\n            product = x * y\n            products.append(product)  # Add the product to the list\n    \n    # Step 3: Sort the products in descending order\n    products.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the top N products\n    return products[:N]  # Return the first N elements of the sorted list\n```",
