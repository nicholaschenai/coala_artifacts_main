    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that checks if all tuples in a given list have the same length. If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of tuples and compare the length of each tuple to the length of the first tuple. If we find any tuple that has a different length, we will return `False`. If we finish checking all tuples without finding any discrepancies, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function get_equal(tuples):\n       if tuples is empty:\n           return True\n       first_length = length of the first tuple\n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           if length of tuple is not equal to first_length:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef get_equal(tuples):\n    # Check if the list of tuples is empty\n    if not tuples:\n        return True  # An empty list is considered to have equal lengths\n    \n    # Get the length of the first tuple\n    first_length = len(tuples[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuples:\n        # Compare the length of the current tuple with the first tuple's length\n        if len(tup) != first_length:\n            return False  # If any tuple has a different length, return False\n    \n    return True  # All tuples have the same length\n```",
