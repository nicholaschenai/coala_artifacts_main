    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple. The new tuple should contain products of adjacent elements from the original tuple. For example, if the input is (1, 5, 7, 8, 10), the output should be (1*5, 5*7, 7*8, 8*10) which equals (5, 35, 56, 80).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the input tuple, multiplying each element by the next one. We will store these products in a new tuple. The length of the new tuple will be one less than the original tuple since we are pairing adjacent elements.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function multiply_elements(t):\n       create an empty list to store results\n       for i from 0 to length of t - 2:\n           product = t[i] * t[i + 1]\n           append product to results list\n       convert results list to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef multiply_elements(t):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    results = []\n    # Iterate through the tuple up to the second last element\n    for i in range(len(t) - 1):\n        # Calculate the product of the current element and the next one\n        product = t[i] * t[i + 1]\n        # Append the product to the results list\n        results.append(product)\n    # Convert the results list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(results)\n\n```",
