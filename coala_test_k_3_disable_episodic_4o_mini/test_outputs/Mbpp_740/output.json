    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to convert a tuple of integers into a dictionary where each pair of adjacent elements in the tuple forms a key-value pair. The first element of the pair becomes the key, and the second element becomes the value. If there is an odd number of elements in the tuple, the last element should be ignored.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We will iterate through the tuple in steps of two. For each pair of elements, we will take the first element as the key and the second element as the value and add them to a dictionary. If the tuple has an odd number of elements, we will simply skip the last element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function tuple_to_dict(input_tuple):\n       create an empty dictionary\n       for i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 1 with step 2:\n           if i + 1 is less than length of input_tuple:\n               key = input_tuple[i]\n               value = input_tuple[i + 1]\n               add key-value pair to the dictionary\n       return the dictionary\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef tuple_to_dict(input_tuple):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store the key-value pairs\n    result_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through the tuple in steps of 2\n    for i in range(0, len(input_tuple) - 1, 2):\n        # Use the current element as the key and the next element as the value\n        key = input_tuple[i]\n        value = input_tuple[i + 1]\n        # Add the key-value pair to the dictionary\n        result_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Return the constructed dictionary\n    return result_dict\n\n# The function is declared last as per the instructions\n```",
