    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a string containing both letters and numbers, and rearranges it so that all the letters come first, followed by all the numbers, while maintaining the original order of letters and numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and separate the characters into two different lists: one for letters and one for numbers. After we finish iterating, we can concatenate the letters and numbers lists to form the final string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize two empty lists: letters and numbers\n   For each character in the input string:\n       If the character is a letter:\n           Append it to the letters list\n       Else if the character is a digit:\n           Append it to the numbers list\n   Concatenate the letters list and the numbers list\n   Return the concatenated result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef move_num(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize two empty lists to hold letters and numbers\n    letters = []\n    numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is a letter\n        if char.isalpha():\n            letters.append(char)  # Add to letters list\n        # Check if the character is a digit\n        elif char.isdigit():\n            numbers.append(char)  # Add to numbers list\n    \n    # Concatenate letters and numbers lists\n    return ''.join(letters) + ''.join(numbers)  # Return the final result\n```",
