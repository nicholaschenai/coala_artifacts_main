    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given integer `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, we can start from 1 (which is 2^0) and keep multiplying by 2 until we exceed `n`. The last value that does not exceed `n` will be our answer.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function highest_Power_of_2(n):\n       if n < 1:\n           return 0\n       power = 1\n       while power * 2 <= n:\n           power = power * 2\n       return power\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef highest_Power_of_2(n: int) -> int:\n    # Check if n is less than 1, return 0 as there are no powers of 2\n    if n < 1:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Initialize the power of 2\n    power = 1\n    \n    # Keep doubling the power until it exceeds n\n    while power * 2 <= n:\n        power = power * 2\n    \n    # Return the highest power of 2 found\n    return power\n```",
