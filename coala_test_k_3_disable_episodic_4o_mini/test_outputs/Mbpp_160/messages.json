If the solution is not unique, then we will consider how to get all the solutions.\n\n    ## Solution by finding the inverse element\n\n    Let us first consider a simpler case where $a$ and $n$ are **coprime** ($\\gcd(a, n) = 1$).\n    Then one can find the [inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$, and multiplying both sides of the equation with the inverse, and we can get a **unique** solution.\n\n    $$x \\equiv b \\cdot a ^ {- 1} \\pmod n$$\n\n    Now consider the case where $a$ and $n$ are **not coprime** ($\\gcd(a, n) \\ne 1$).\n    Then the solution will not always exist (for example $2 \\cdot x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ has no solution).\n\n    Let $g = \\gcd(a, n)$, i.e. the [greatest common divisor](euclid-algorithm.md) of $a$ and $n$ (which in this case is greater than one).\n\n    Then, if $b$ is not divisible by $g$, there is no solution. In fact, for any $x$ the left side of the equation $a \\cdot x \\pmod n$ , is always divisible by $g$, while the right-hand side is not divisible by it, hence it follows that there are no solutions.\n\n    If $g$ divides $b$, then by dividing both sides of the equation by $g$ (i.e. dividing $a$, $b$ and $n$ by $g$), we receive a new equation:\n\n    $$a^\\prime \\cdot x \\equiv b^\\prime \\pmod{n^\\prime}$$\n\n    in which $a^\\prime$ and $n^\\prime$ are already relatively prime, and we have already learned how to handle such an equation.\n    We get $x^\\prime$ as solution for $x$.\n\n    It is clear that this $x^\\prime$ will also be a solution of the original equation.\n    However it will **not be the only solution**.\n    It can be shown that the original equation has exactly $g$ solutions, and they will look like this:\n\n    $$x_i \\equiv (x^\\prime + i\\cdot n^\\prime) \\pmod n \\quad \\text{for } i = 0 \\ldots g-1$$\n\n    Summarizing, we can say that the **number of solutions** of the linear congruence equation is equal to either $g = \\gcd(a, n)$ or to zero.\n\n    ## Solution with the Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n\n    We can rewrite the linear congruence to the following Diophantine equation:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x + n \\cdot k = b,$$\n\n    where $x$ and $k$ are unknown integers.\n\n    The method of solving this equation is described in the corresponding article [Linear Diophantine equations](linear-diophantine-equation.md) and it consists of applying the [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md).\n\n    It also describes the method of obtaining all solutions of this equation from one found solution, and incidentally this method, when carefully considered, is absolutely equivalent to the method described in the previous section.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Linear Diophantine Equation\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Linear Diophantine Equation\n\n    A Linear Diophantine Equation (in two variables) is an equation of the general form:\n\n    $$ax + by = c$$\n\n    where $a$, $b$, $c$ are given integers, and $x$, $y$ are unknown integers.\n\n    In this article, we consider several classical problems on these equations:\n\n    * finding one solution\n    * finding all solutions\n    * finding the number of solutions and the solutions themselves in a given interval\n    * finding a solution with minimum value of $x + y$\n\n    ## The degenerate case\n\n    A degenerate case that need to be taken care of is when $a = b = 0$. It is easy to see that we either have no solutions or infinitely many solutions, depending on whether $c = 0$ or not. In the rest of this article, we will ignore this case.\n\n    ## Analytic solution\n\n    When $a \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 0$, the equation $ax+by=c$ can be equivalently treated as either of the following:\n\n    \\begin{gather}\n    ax \\equiv c \\pmod b,\\newline\n    by \\equiv c \\pmod a.\n    \\end{gather}\n\n    Without loss of generality, assume that $b \\neq 0$ and consider the first equation. When $a$ and $b$ are co-prime, the solution to it is given as\n\n    $$x \\equiv ca^{-1} \\pmod b,$$\n\n    where $a^{-1}$ is the [modular inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$ modulo $b$.\n\n    When $a$ and $b$ are not co-prime, values of $ax$ modulo $b$ for all integer $x$ are divisible by $g=\\gcd(a, b)$, so the solution only exists when $c$ is divisible by $g$. In this case, one of solutions can be found by reducing the equation by $g$:\n\n    $$(a/g) x \\equiv (c/g) \\pmod{b/g}.$$\n\n    By the definition of $g$, the numbers $a/g$ and $b/g$ are co-prime, so the solution is given explicitly as\n\n    $$\\begin{cases}\n    x \\equiv (c/g)(a/g)^{-1}\\pmod{b/g},\\\\\n    y = \\frac{c-ax}{b}.\n    \\end{cases}$$\n\n    ## Algorithmic solution\n\n    To find one solution of the Diophantine equation with 2 unknowns, you can use the [Extended Euclidean algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md). First, assume that $a$ and $b$ are non-negative. When we apply Extended Euclidean algorithm for $a$ and $b$, we can find their greatest common divisor $g$ and 2 numbers $x_g$ and $y_g$ such that:\n\n    $$a x_g + b y_g = g$$\n\n    If $c$ is divisible by $g = \\gcd(a, b)$, then the given Diophantine equation has a solution, otherwise it does not have any solution. The proof is straight-forward: a linear combination of two numbers is divisible by their common divisor.\n\n    Now supposed that $c$ is divisible by $g$, then we have:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g} + b \\cdot y_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g} = c$$\n\n    Therefore one of the solutions of the Diophantine equation is:\n\n    $$x_0 = x_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g},$$\n\n    $$y_0 = y_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g}.$$\n\n    The above idea still works when $a$ or $b$ or both of them are negative. We only need to change the sign of $x_0$ and $y_0$ when necessary.\n\n    Finally, we can implement this idea as follows (note that this code does not consider the case $a = b = 0$):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_any}\n    int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {\n        if (b == 0) {\n            x = 1;\n            y = 0;\n            return a;\n        }\n        int x1, y1;\n        int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);\n        x = y1;\n        y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);\n        return d;\n    }\n\n    bool find_any_solution(int a, int b, int c, int &x0, int &y0, int &g) {\n        g = gcd(abs(a), abs(b), x0, y0);\n        if (c % g) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        x0 *= c / g;\n        y0 *= c / g;\n        if (a < 0) x0 = -x0;\n        if (b < 0) y0 = -y0;\n        return true;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Getting all solutions\n\n    From one solution $(x_0, y_0)$, we can obtain all the solutions of the given equation.\n\n    Let $g = \\gcd(a, b)$ and let $x_0, y_0$ be integers which satisfy the following:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot y_0 = c$$\n\n    Now, we should see that adding $b / g$ to $x_0$, and, at the same time subtracting $a / g$ from $y_0$ will not break the equality:\n\n    $$a \\cdot \\left(x_0 + \\frac{b}{g}\\right) + b \\cdot \\left(y_0 - \\frac{a}{g}\\right) = a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot y_0 + a \\cdot \\frac{b}{g} - b \\cdot \\frac{a}{g} = c$$\n\n    Obviously, this process can be repeated again, so all the numbers of the form:\n\n    $$x = x_0 + k \\cdot \\frac{b}{g}$$\n\n    $$y = y_0 - k \\cdot \\frac{a}{g}$$\n\n    are solutions of the given Diophantine equation.\n\n    Moreover, this is the set of all possible solutions of the given Diophantine equation.\n\n    ## Finding the number of solutions and the solutions in a given interval\n\n    From previous section, it should be clear that if we don't impose any restrictions on the solutions, there would be infinite number of them. So in this section, we add some restrictions on the interval of $x$ and $y$, and we will try to count and enumerate all the solutions.\n\n    Let there be two intervals: $[min_x; max_x]$ and $[min_y; max_y]$ and let's say we only want to find the solutions in these two intervals.\n\n    Note that if $a$ or $b$ is $0$, then the problem only has one solution. We don't consider this case here.\n\n    First, we can find a solution which have minimum value of $x$, such that $x \\ge min_x$. To do this, we first find any solution of the Diophantine equation. Then, we shift this solution to get $x \\ge min_x$ (using what we know about the set of all solutions in previous section). This can be done in $O(1)$.\n    Denote this minimum value of $x$ by $l_{x1}$.\n\n    Similarly, we can find the maximum value of $x$ which satisfy $x \\le max_x$. Denote this maximum value of $x$ by $r_{x1}$.\n\n    Similarly, we can find the minimum value of $y$ $(y \\ge min_y)$ and maximum values of $y$ $(y \\le max_y)$. Denote the corresponding values of $x$ by $l_{x2}$ and $r_{x2}$.\n\n    The final solution is all solutions with x in intersection of $[l_{x1}, r_{x1}]$ and $[l_{x2}, r_{x2}]$. Let denote this intersection by $[l_x, r_x]$.\n\n    Following is the code implementing this idea.\n    Notice that we divide $a$ and $b$ at the beginning by $g$.\n    Since the equation $a x + b y = c$ is equivalent to the equation $\\frac{a}{g} x + \\frac{b}{g} y = \\frac{c}{g}$, we can use this one instead and have $\\gcd(\\frac{a}{g}, \\frac{b}{g}) = 1$, which simplifies the formulas.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_all}\n    void shift_solution(int & x, int & y, int a, int b, int cnt) {\n        x += cnt * b;\n        y -= cnt * a;\n    }\n\n    int find_all_solutions(int a, int b, int c, int minx, int maxx, int miny, int maxy) {\n        int x, y, g;\n        if (!find_any_solution(a, b, c, x, y, g))\n            return 0;\n        a /= g;\n        b /= g;\n\n        int sign_a = a > 0 ? +1 : -1;\n        int sign_b = b > 0 ? +1 : -1;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (minx - x) / b);\n        if (x < minx)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_b);\n        if (x > maxx)\n            return 0;\n        int lx1 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (maxx - x) / b);\n        if (x > maxx)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_b);\n        int rx1 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(miny - y) / a);\n        if (y < miny)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_a);\n        if (y > maxy)\n            return 0;\n        int lx2 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(maxy - y) / a);\n        if (y > maxy)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_a);\n        int rx2 = x;\n\n        if (lx2 > rx2)\n            swap(lx2, rx2);\n        int lx = max(lx1, lx2);\n        int rx = min(rx1, rx2);\n\n        if (lx > rx)\n            return 0;\n        return (rx - lx) / abs(b) + 1;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

We need to adjust the solution to ensure we find the correct integers that satisfy the equation.\n\nNow, I will revise the code to ensure it finds the correct integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy the equation \\( ax + by = n \\). \n\nHere\u2019s the updated solution:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    # Function to compute the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef extended_euclidean(a, b):\n    # Function to find one solution (x, y) such that ax + by = gcd(a, b)\n    if b == 0:\n        return (1, 0)  # Base case\n    x1, y1 = extended_euclidean(b, a % b)\n    return (y1, x1 - (a // b) * y1)\n\ndef find_solution(a: int, b: int, n: int) -> tuple[int, int] | None:\n    # Calculate the gcd of a and b\n    g = gcd(a, b)\n    # Check if n is divisible by g\n    if n % g != 0:\n        return None  # No solution exists\n    \n    # Find one solution using Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n    x0, y0 = extended_euclidean(a, b)\n    x0 *= n // g  # Scale the solution\n    y0 *= n // g\n    \n    # Adjust x0 and y0 to find a valid solution\n    # We need to find k such that both x0 + (b/g) * k and y0 - (a/g) * k are non-negative\n    b_div_g = b // g\n    a_div_g = a // g\n    \n    # Find a suitable k to make x0 and y0 non-negative\n    if x0 < 0:\n        k = (-x0 + b_div_g - 1) // b_div_g  # Ceil division\n    else:\n        k = 0\n    \n    x0 += b_div_g * k\n    y0 -= a_div_g * k\n    \n    if y0 < 0:\n        return None  # If y becomes negative, return None\n    \n    return (x0, y0)  # Return the solution as a tuple\n```"

If the solution is not unique, then we will consider how to get all the solutions.\n\n    ## Solution by finding the inverse element\n\n    Let us first consider a simpler case where $a$ and $n$ are **coprime** ($\\gcd(a, n) = 1$).\n    Then one can find the [inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$, and multiplying both sides of the equation with the inverse, and we can get a **unique** solution.\n\n    $$x \\equiv b \\cdot a ^ {- 1} \\pmod n$$\n\n    Now consider the case where $a$ and $n$ are **not coprime** ($\\gcd(a, n) \\ne 1$).\n    Then the solution will not always exist (for example $2 \\cdot x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ has no solution).\n\n    Let $g = \\gcd(a, n)$, i.e. the [greatest common divisor](euclid-algorithm.md) of $a$ and $n$ (which in this case is greater than one).\n\n    Then, if $b$ is not divisible by $g$, there is no solution. In fact, for any $x$ the left side of the equation $a \\cdot x \\pmod n$ , is always divisible by $g$, while the right-hand side is not divisible by it, hence it follows that there are no solutions.\n\n    If $g$ divides $b$, then by dividing both sides of the equation by $g$ (i.e. dividing $a$, $b$ and $n$ by $g$), we receive a new equation:\n\n    $$a^\\prime \\cdot x \\equiv b^\\prime \\pmod{n^\\prime}$$\n\n    in which $a^\\prime$ and $n^\\prime$ are already relatively prime, and we have already learned how to handle such an equation.\n    We get $x^\\prime$ as solution for $x$.\n\n    It is clear that this $x^\\prime$ will also be a solution of the original equation.\n    However it will **not be the only solution**.\n    It can be shown that the original equation has exactly $g$ solutions, and they will look like this:\n\n    $$x_i \\equiv (x^\\prime + i\\cdot n^\\prime) \\pmod n \\quad \\text{for } i = 0 \\ldots g-1$$\n\n    Summarizing, we can say that the **number of solutions** of the linear congruence equation is equal to either $g = \\gcd(a, n)$ or to zero.\n\n    ## Solution with the Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n\n    We can rewrite the linear congruence to the following Diophantine equation:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x + n \\cdot k = b,$$\n\n    where $x$ and $k$ are unknown integers.\n\n    The method of solving this equation is described in the corresponding article [Linear Diophantine equations](linear-diophantine-equation.md) and it consists of applying the [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md).\n\n    It also describes the method of obtaining all solutions of this equation from one found solution, and incidentally this method, when carefully considered, is absolutely equivalent to the method described in the previous section.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n\n    While the [Euclidean algorithm](euclid-algorithm.md) calculates only the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers $a$ and $b$, the extended version also finds a way to represent GCD in terms of $a$ and $b$, i.e. coefficients $x$ and $y$ for which:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x + b \\cdot y = \\gcd(a, b)$$\n\n    It's important to note that by [B\u00e9zout's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity) we can always find such a representation. For instance, $\\gcd(55, 80) = 5$, therefore we can represent $5$ as a linear combination with the terms $55$ and $80$: $55 \\cdot 3 + 80 \\cdot (-2) = 5$ \n\n    A more general form of that problem is discussed in the article about [Linear Diophantine Equations](linear-diophantine-equation.md).\n    It will build upon this algorithm.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n\n    We will denote the GCD of $a$ and $b$ with $g$ in this section.\n\n    The changes to the original algorithm are very simple.\n    If we recall the algorithm, we can see that the algorithm ends with $b = 0$ and $a = g$.\n    For these parameters we can easily find coefficients, namely $g \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0 = g$.\n\n    Starting from these coefficients $(x, y) = (1, 0)$, we can go backwards up the recursive calls.\n    All we need to do is to figure out how the coefficients $x$ and $y$ change during the transition from $(a, b)$ to $(b, a \\bmod b)$.\n\n    Let us assume we found the coefficients $(x_1, y_1)$ for $(b, a \\bmod b)$:\n\n    $$b \\cdot x_1 + (a \\bmod b) \\cdot y_1 = g$$\n\n    and we want to find the pair $(x, y)$ for $(a, b)$:\n\n    $$ a \\cdot x + b \\cdot y = g$$\n\n    We can represent $a \\bmod b$ as:\n\n    $$ a \\bmod b = a - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\right\\rfloor \\cdot b$$\n\n    Substituting this expression in the coefficient equation of $(x_1, y_1)$ gives:\n\n    $$ g = b \\cdot x_1 + (a \\bmod b) \\cdot y_1 = b \\cdot x_1 + \\left(a - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\right\\rfloor \\cdot b \\right) \\cdot y_1$$\n\n    and after rearranging the terms:\n\n    $$g = a \\cdot y_1 + b \\cdot \\left( x_1 - y_1 \\cdot \\left\\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\right\\rfloor \\right)$$\n\n    We found the values of $x$ and $y$:\n\n    $$\\begin{cases}\n    x = y_1 \\\\\n    y = x_1 - y_1 \\cdot \\left\\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\right\\rfloor\n    \\end{cases} $$\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```{.cpp file=extended_gcd}\n    int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {\n        if (b == 0) {\n            x = 1;\n            y = 0;\n            return a;\n        }\n        int x1, y1;\n        int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);\n        x = y1;\n        y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);\n        return d;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The recursive function above returns the GCD and the values of coefficients to `x` and `y` (which are passed by reference to the function).\n\n    This implementation of extended Euclidean algorithm produces correct results for negative integers as well.\n\n    ## Iterative version\n\n    It's also possible to write the Extended Euclidean algorithm in an iterative way.\n    Because it avoids recursion, the code will run a little bit faster than the recursive one.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=extended_gcd_iter}\n    int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {\n        x = 1, y = 0;\n        int x1 = 0, y1 = 1, a1 = a, b1 = b;\n        while (b1) {\n            int q = a1 / b1;\n            tie(x, x1) = make_tuple(x1, x - q * x1);\n            tie(y, y1) = make_tuple(y1, y - q * y1);\n            tie(a1, b1) = make_tuple(b1, a1 - q * b1);\n        }\n        return a1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    If you look closely at the variable `a1` and `b1`, you can notice that they taking exactly the same values as in the iterative version of the normal [Euclidean algorithm](euclid-algorithm.md). So the algorithm will at least compute the correct GCD.\n\n    To see why the algorithm also computes the correct coefficients, you can check that the following invariants will hold at any time (before the while loop, and at the end of each iteration): $x \\cdot a + y \\cdot b = a_1$ and $x_1 \\cdot a + y_1 \\cdot b = b_1$.\n    It's trivial to see, that these two equations are satisfied at the beginning.\n    And you can check that the update in the loop iteration will still keep those equalities valid.\n\n    At the end we know that $a_1$ contains the GCD, so $x \\cdot a + y \\cdot b = g$.\n    Which means that we have found the required coefficients.\n\n    You can even optimize the code more, and remove the variable $a_1$ and $b_1$ from the code, and just reuse $a$ and $b$.\n    However if you do so, you lose the ability to argue about the invariants.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Linear Diophantine Equation\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Linear Diophantine Equation\n\n    A Linear Diophantine Equation (in two variables) is an equation of the general form:\n\n    $$ax + by = c$$\n\n    where $a$, $b$, $c$ are given integers, and $x$, $y$ are unknown integers.\n\n    In this article, we consider several classical problems on these equations:\n\n    * finding one solution\n    * finding all solutions\n    * finding the number of solutions and the solutions themselves in a given interval\n    * finding a solution with minimum value of $x + y$\n\n    ## The degenerate case\n\n    A degenerate case that need to be taken care of is when $a = b = 0$. It is easy to see that we either have no solutions or infinitely many solutions, depending on whether $c = 0$ or not. In the rest of this article, we will ignore this case.\n\n    ## Analytic solution\n\n    When $a \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 0$, the equation $ax+by=c$ can be equivalently treated as either of the following:\n\n    \\begin{gather}\n    ax \\equiv c \\pmod b,\\newline\n    by \\equiv c \\pmod a.\n    \\end{gather}\n\n    Without loss of generality, assume that $b \\neq 0$ and consider the first equation. When $a$ and $b$ are co-prime, the solution to it is given as\n\n    $$x \\equiv ca^{-1} \\pmod b,$$\n\n    where $a^{-1}$ is the [modular inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$ modulo $b$.\n\n    When $a$ and $b$ are not co-prime, values of $ax$ modulo $b$ for all integer $x$ are divisible by $g=\\gcd(a, b)$, so the solution only exists when $c$ is divisible by $g$. In this case, one of solutions can be found by reducing the equation by $g$:\n\n    $$(a/g) x \\equiv (c/g) \\pmod{b/g}.$$\n\n    By the definition of $g$, the numbers $a/g$ and $b/g$ are co-prime, so the solution is given explicitly as\n\n    $$\\begin{cases}\n    x \\equiv (c/g)(a/g)^{-1}\\pmod{b/g},\\\\\n    y = \\frac{c-ax}{b}.\n    \\end{cases}$$\n\n    ## Algorithmic solution\n\n    To find one solution of the Diophantine equation with 2 unknowns, you can use the [Extended Euclidean algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md). First, assume that $a$ and $b$ are non-negative. When we apply Extended Euclidean algorithm for $a$ and $b$, we can find their greatest common divisor $g$ and 2 numbers $x_g$ and $y_g$ such that:\n\n    $$a x_g + b y_g = g$$\n\n    If $c$ is divisible by $g = \\gcd(a, b)$, then the given Diophantine equation has a solution, otherwise it does not have any solution. The proof is straight-forward: a linear combination of two numbers is divisible by their common divisor.\n\n    Now supposed that $c$ is divisible by $g$, then we have:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g} + b \\cdot y_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g} = c$$\n\n    Therefore one of the solutions of the Diophantine equation is:\n\n    $$x_0 = x_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g},$$\n\n    $$y_0 = y_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g}.$$\n\n    The above idea still works when $a$ or $b$ or both of them are negative. We only need to change the sign of $x_0$ and $y_0$ when necessary.\n\n    Finally, we can implement this idea as follows (note that this code does not consider the case $a = b = 0$):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_any}\n    int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {\n        if (b == 0) {\n            x = 1;\n            y = 0;\n            return a;\n        }\n        int x1, y1;\n        int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);\n        x = y1;\n        y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);\n        return d;\n    }\n\n    bool find_any_solution(int a, int b, int c, int &x0, int &y0, int &g) {\n        g = gcd(abs(a), abs(b), x0, y0);\n        if (c % g) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        x0 *= c / g;\n        y0 *= c / g;\n        if (a < 0) x0 = -x0;\n        if (b < 0) y0 = -y0;\n        return true;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Getting all solutions\n\n    From one solution $(x_0, y_0)$, we can obtain all the solutions of the given equation.\n\n    Let $g = \\gcd(a, b)$ and let $x_0, y_0$ be integers which satisfy the following:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot y_0 = c$$\n\n    Now, we should see that adding $b / g$ to $x_0$, and, at the same time subtracting $a / g$ from $y_0$ will not break the equality:\n\n    $$a \\cdot \\left(x_0 + \\frac{b}{g}\\right) + b \\cdot \\left(y_0 - \\frac{a}{g}\\right) = a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot y_0 + a \\cdot \\frac{b}{g} - b \\cdot \\frac{a}{g} = c$$\n\n    Obviously, this process can be repeated again, so all the numbers of the form:\n\n    $$x = x_0 + k \\cdot \\frac{b}{g}$$\n\n    $$y = y_0 - k \\cdot \\frac{a}{g}$$\n\n    are solutions of the given Diophantine equation.\n\n    Moreover, this is the set of all possible solutions of the given Diophantine equation.\n\n    ## Finding the number of solutions and the solutions in a given interval\n\n    From previous section, it should be clear that if we don't impose any restrictions on the solutions, there would be infinite number of them. So in this section, we add some restrictions on the interval of $x$ and $y$, and we will try to count and enumerate all the solutions.\n\n    Let there be two intervals: $[min_x; max_x]$ and $[min_y; max_y]$ and let's say we only want to find the solutions in these two intervals.\n\n    Note that if $a$ or $b$ is $0$, then the problem only has one solution. We don't consider this case here.\n\n    First, we can find a solution which have minimum value of $x$, such that $x \\ge min_x$. To do this, we first find any solution of the Diophantine equation. Then, we shift this solution to get $x \\ge min_x$ (using what we know about the set of all solutions in previous section). This can be done in $O(1)$.\n    Denote this minimum value of $x$ by $l_{x1}$.\n\n    Similarly, we can find the maximum value of $x$ which satisfy $x \\le max_x$. Denote this maximum value of $x$ by $r_{x1}$.\n\n    Similarly, we can find the minimum value of $y$ $(y \\ge min_y)$ and maximum values of $y$ $(y \\le max_y)$. Denote the corresponding values of $x$ by $l_{x2}$ and $r_{x2}$.\n\n    The final solution is all solutions with x in intersection of $[l_{x1}, r_{x1}]$ and $[l_{x2}, r_{x2}]$. Let denote this intersection by $[l_x, r_x]$.\n\n    Following is the code implementing this idea.\n    Notice that we divide $a$ and $b$ at the beginning by $g$.\n    Since the equation $a x + b y = c$ is equivalent to the equation $\\frac{a}{g} x + \\frac{b}{g} y = \\frac{c}{g}$, we can use this one instead and have $\\gcd(\\frac{a}{g}, \\frac{b}{g}) = 1$, which simplifies the formulas.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_all}\n    void shift_solution(int & x, int & y, int a, int b, int cnt) {\n        x += cnt * b;\n        y -= cnt * a;\n    }\n\n    int find_all_solutions(int a, int b, int c, int minx, int maxx, int miny, int maxy) {\n        int x, y, g;\n        if (!find_any_solution(a, b, c, x, y, g))\n            return 0;\n        a /= g;\n        b /= g;\n\n        int sign_a = a > 0 ? +1 : -1;\n        int sign_b = b > 0 ? +1 : -1;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (minx - x) / b);\n        if (x < minx)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_b);\n        if (x > maxx)\n            return 0;\n        int lx1 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (maxx - x) / b);\n        if (x > maxx)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_b);\n        int rx1 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(miny - y) / a);\n        if (y < miny)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_a);\n        if (y > maxy)\n            return 0;\n        int lx2 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(maxy - y) / a);\n        if (y > maxy)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_a);\n        int rx2 = x;\n\n        if (lx2 > rx2)\n            swap(lx2, rx2);\n        int lx = max(lx1, lx2);\n        int rx = min(rx1, rx2);\n\n        if (lx > rx)\n            return 0;\n        return (rx - lx) / abs(b) + 1;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
