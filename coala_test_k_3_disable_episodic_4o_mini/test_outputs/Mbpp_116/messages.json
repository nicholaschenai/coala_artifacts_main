The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \\( A[i] \\) by its index \\( i \\) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is \"YES\". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is \"NO\". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \\( N \\) natural numbers.\n\n    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \\( N(N + 1)/2 \\). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.\n\n    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is zero.\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.\n       - Returning \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n        \n            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array\n            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible\n        \n            if total_sum == 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n\n    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to find the number of ways to express a natural number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \\( K \\). The solution involved a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the valid combinations without repeating calculations.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the use of recursion to explore combinations while ensuring uniqueness of integers. The recursive function `countWays` was designed to track the current sum and the last integer used, preventing the reuse of integers. Memoization was implemented to store previously computed results for specific states, which significantly improved performance.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, reading multiple test cases and producing the correct results. The code was structured to first define helper functions and then the main function, adhering to the specified format. Overall, the approach was effective, and the solution passed all provided test cases without errors. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countWays(N, K, current, last, memo):\n        # Base case: if current sum equals N, we found a valid way\n        if current == N:\n            return 1\n        # If current sum exceeds N, this path is invalid\n        if current > N:\n            return 0\n        # Check if the result is already computed\n        if (current, last) in memo:\n            return memo[(current, last)]\n    \n        totalWays = 0\n        # Start from the next integer after 'last'\n        for i in range(last + 1, N + 1):\n            totalWays += countWays(N, K, current + i**K, i, memo)\n    \n        # Store the result in memoization dictionary\n        memo[(current, last)] = totalWays\n        return totalWays\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recursion and memoization in solving combinatorial problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
