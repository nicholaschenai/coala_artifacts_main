    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of even numbers that are located at even indices in a given list of integers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list and check each element's index. If the index is even (0, 2, 4, ...), we will then check if the element itself is even. If both conditions are met, we will add that element to a running total. Finally, we will return the total sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum_even_and_even_index(numbers):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for index from 0 to length of numbers - 1:\n           if index is even:\n               if numbers[index] is even:\n                   add numbers[index] to total_sum\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sum_even_and_even_index(numbers):\n    # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the list with index\n    for index in range(len(numbers)):\n        # Check if the index is even\n        if index % 2 == 0:\n            # Check if the number at this index is even\n            if numbers[index] % 2 == 0:\n                # Add the even number at an even index to the total sum\n                total_sum += numbers[index]\n    \n    # Return the total sum of even numbers at even indices\n    return total_sum\n```",
