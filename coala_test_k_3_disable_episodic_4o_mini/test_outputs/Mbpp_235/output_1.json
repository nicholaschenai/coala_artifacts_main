The goal is to create a mask that only modifies the even bits of the input number.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected implementation:\n\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Create a mask to set all even bits to 1\n    mask = 0\n    for i in range(32):  # Assuming a 32-bit integer\n        if i % 2 == 0:  # Check if the position is even\n            mask |= (1 << i)  # Set the bit at position i to 1\n    # Set only the even bits of n to 1 using bitwise OR\n    return n | mask\n``` \n\nThis code will ensure that all even bits of the input number `n` are set to 1 while leaving the odd bits unchanged.",
