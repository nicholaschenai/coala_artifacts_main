    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes an integer as input and sets all even bits of that integer to 1. An even bit is defined as a bit that is in an even position when counting from the right, starting at position 0.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to identify the even bit positions in the binary representation of the number. We can create a mask that has 1s in all even positions and 0s in all odd positions. By performing a bitwise OR operation between the original number and this mask, we can set all even bits to 1 while leaving the odd bits unchanged.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function even_bit_set_number(n):\n       create a mask with 1s in all even positions\n       for each bit position from 0 to the maximum bit length of n:\n           if the position is even:\n               set the corresponding bit in the mask to 1\n       return n OR mask\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef create_even_bit_mask():\n    mask = 0\n    for i in range(32):  # Assuming a 32-bit integer\n        if i % 2 == 0:  # Check if the position is even\n            mask |= (1 << i)  # Set the bit at position i to 1\n    return mask\n\ndef even_bit_set_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Create a mask with 1s in all even positions\n    mask = create_even_bit_mask()\n    # Set all even bits of n to 1 using bitwise OR\n    return n | mask\n```",
