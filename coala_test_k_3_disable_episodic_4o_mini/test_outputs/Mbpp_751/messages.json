The first step is to check if the total length of the matchsticks is divisible by 4, as this is a necessary condition for forming a square. If it is not, the function can immediately return false.\n\n    The backtracking approach was effective in exploring combinations of matchsticks to build the four sides of the square. By sorting the matchsticks in descending order, I improved the efficiency of the backtracking process, as larger matchsticks are placed first, reducing the number of recursive calls needed.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach works well within the constraints given (length of matchstick array not exceeding 15). The code structure, with a helper function for backtracking, allowed for clear separation of logic and improved readability.\n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def backtrack(index):\n        if index == len(nums):\n            return all(side == side_length for side in sides)\n        for i in range(4):\n            if sides[i] + nums[index] <= side_length:\n                sides[i] += nums[index]\n                if backtrack(index + 1):\n                    return True\n                sides[i] -= nums[index]\n            if sides[i] == 0:\n                break\n        return False\n    ``` \n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of checking base conditions early and using backtracking for combinatorial problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \\( A[i] \\) by its index \\( i \\) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is \"YES\". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is \"NO\". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \\( N \\) natural numbers.\n\n    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \\( N(N + 1)/2 \\). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.\n\n    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is zero.\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.\n       - Returning \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n        \n            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array\n            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible\n        \n            if total_sum == 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n\n    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money to a group of minions such that he ends up with exactly zero money left. The key concepts involved were understanding the total demand from the minions and ensuring that each individual demand could be satisfied without exceeding the amount of money Gru had at any point.\n\n    Initially, the approach was to simply check if the total demand equaled the amount of money Gru had. However, this was insufficient because it did not account for the individual demands of the minions. The correct approach required checking both the total demand and ensuring that each individual demand was less than or equal to the money Gru had.\n\n    The final solution involved calculating the total demand and checking if it matched Gru's total money. If it did, the output was \"YES\"; otherwise, it was \"NO\". However, the solution failed to pass the tests because it did not consider the scenario where the total demand could be less than Gru's money but still not allow for exact distribution.\n\n    The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of considering both aggregate and individual constraints when solving distribution problems. The final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Extract number of minions and amount of money Gru has\n            A = case[2]  # Extract the list of demands from minions\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)  # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by minions\n        \n            # Check if the total demand equals the money Gru has\n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")  # Gru can distribute the money exactly\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")  # Gru cannot distribute the money as required\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the need for careful consideration of problem constraints and the importance of validating both total and individual conditions in distribution scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
