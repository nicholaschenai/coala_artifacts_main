INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/635 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function called `heap_sort` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with those numbers sorted in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To sort the list using the heap sort algorithm, we will:
   - Build a max heap from the input list.
   - Repeatedly extract the maximum element from the heap and place it at the end of the list.
   - Adjust the heap after each extraction to maintain the heap property.
   - The result will be a sorted list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function heap_sort(arr):
       n = length of arr
       build_max_heap(arr, n)
       for i from n-1 down to 1:
           swap arr[0] with arr[i]
           heapify(arr, 0, i)
       return arr

   function build_max_heap(arr, n):
       for i from n//2 - 1 down to 0:
           heapify(arr, i, n)

   function heapify(arr, i, n):
       largest = i
       left = 2*i + 1
       right = 2*i + 2
       if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:
           largest = left
       if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:
           largest = right
       if largest != i:
           swap arr[i] with arr[largest]
           heapify(arr, largest, n)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def heapify(arr, n, i):
    largest = i  # Initialize largest as root
    left = 2 * i + 1  # left child index
    right = 2 * i + 2  # right child index

    # If left child is larger than root

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I implemented a solution to find the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concept involved identifying the rightmost ascent in the permutation, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.

    The implementation followed a clear structure: a helper function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution successfully handled multiple permutations as specified in the problem statement.

    One key takeaway is the importance of understanding the mechanics of generating permutations, particularly the lexicographic order. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. The code was tested against sample inputs, and it produced the expected outputs, confirming its correctness. 

    Here’s the essential code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def next_permutation(arr):
        i = len(arr) - 2
        while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:
            i -= 1
        if i == -1:
            arr.reverse()
            return arr
        j = len(arr) - 1
        while arr[j] <= arr[i]:
            j -= 1
        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])
        return arr

    def main():
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        results = []
        for _ in range(K):
            permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))
            next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, next_perm)))
        print("\n".join(results))

    main()
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the solution's structure, which can be useful for similar tasks in the future.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next lexicographic permutation of a sequence. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:

    1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This is a good practice for competitive programming as it simplifies the main logic and improves readability.

    2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`. This is crucial because it identifies the point where the order can be changed to create the next permutation.

    3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible permutation that is larger than the current one.

    4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After swapping the pivot with the identified successor, the solution sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This step is efficient because it guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.

    5. **Output**: The results are printed in a single line using unpacking, which is a concise way to format the output.

    Overall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a clear understanding of the permutation generation process. My initial approach was similar but could have benefited from a more structured input handling and clearer separation of the steps involved in finding the next permutation. The official solution's use of sorting the suffix after the swap is a particularly effective way to ensure correctness without additional complexity.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I implemented a solution to handle a hill jumping competition where participants jump between hills based on their heights. The key operations involved were determining the final hill index after a series of jumps and updating the heights of a range of hills.

    The core concepts tested included:
    - Efficiently finding the nearest higher hill within a limited range (100 hills).
    - Handling multiple operations on an array of heights, including both read and update operations.

    The solution utilized a straightforward approach where for each jump, I iterated through the hills to the right of the current position to find the next valid hill. This was done in a while loop, which continued until the maximum number of jumps was reached or no valid hill was found. The height updates were handled with a simple loop over the specified range.

    The implementation was successful, passing all provided test cases, indicating that the logic for both types of operations was correctly executed. The final code efficiently managed the operations within the constraints, demonstrating a clear understanding of array manipulation and iteration in Python. 

    Key code snippet for the jump operation:
    ```python
    while jumps < k:
        next_index = current_index + 1
        found = False
        while next_index < N and next_index <= current_index + 100:
            if A[next_index] > A[current_index]:
                current_index = next_index
                found = True
                break
            next_index += 1
        if not found:
            break
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing indices and conditions when working with array-based problems, especially in competitive programming contexts.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/635 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that sorts a given list of numbers in ascending order using the heap sort algorithm.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The heap sort algorithm involves two main steps: 
   - First, we need to build a max heap from the input list. A max heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
   - Then, we repeatedly extract the maximum element from the heap (which is the root of the heap) and place it at the end of the list, reducing the size of the heap by one each time, until the heap is empty.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function heap_sort(arr):
       build_max_heap(arr)
       for i from length(arr) - 1 down to 1:
