The core concept involved identifying the rightmost ascent in the permutation, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.\n\n    The implementation followed a clear structure: a helper function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution successfully handled multiple permutations as specified in the problem statement.\n\n    One key takeaway is the importance of understanding the mechanics of generating permutations, particularly the lexicographic order. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. The code was tested against sample inputs, and it produced the expected outputs, confirming its correctness. \n\n    Here\u2019s the essential code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def next_permutation(arr):\n        i = len(arr) - 2\n        while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        if i == -1:\n            arr.reverse()\n            return arr\n        j = len(arr) - 1\n        while arr[j] <= arr[i]:\n            j -= 1\n        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n        arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])\n        return arr\n\n    def main():\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(K):\n            permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)\n            results.append(\" \".join(map(str, next_perm)))\n        print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the solution's structure, which can be useful for similar tasks in the future.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next lexicographic permutation of a sequence. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This is a good practice for competitive programming as it simplifies the main logic and improves readability.\n\n    2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`. This is crucial because it identifies the point where the order can be changed to create the next permutation.\n\n    3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible permutation that is larger than the current one.\n\n    4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After swapping the pivot with the identified successor, the solution sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This step is efficient because it guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.\n\n    5. **Output**: The results are printed in a single line using unpacking, which is a concise way to format the output.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a clear understanding of the permutation generation process. My initial approach was similar but could have benefited from a more structured input handling and clearer separation of the steps involved in finding the next permutation. The official solution's use of sorting the suffix after the swap is a particularly effective way to ensure correctness without additional complexity.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, I implemented a solution to handle a hill jumping competition where participants jump between hills based on their heights. The key operations involved were determining the final hill index after a series of jumps and updating the heights of a range of hills.\n\n    The core concepts tested included:\n    - Efficiently finding the nearest higher hill within a limited range (100 hills).\n    - Handling multiple operations on an array of heights, including both read and update operations.\n\n    The solution utilized a straightforward approach where for each jump, I iterated through the hills to the right of the current position to find the next valid hill. This was done in a while loop, which continued until the maximum number of jumps was reached or no valid hill was found. The height updates were handled with a simple loop over the specified range.\n\n    The implementation was successful, passing all provided test cases, indicating that the logic for both types of operations was correctly executed. The final code efficiently managed the operations within the constraints, demonstrating a clear understanding of array manipulation and iteration in Python. \n\n    Key code snippet for the jump operation:\n    ```python\n    while jumps < k:\n        next_index = current_index + 1\n        found = False\n        while next_index < N and next_index <= current_index + 100:\n            if A[next_index] > A[current_index]:\n                current_index = next_index\n                found = True\n                break\n            next_index += 1\n        if not found:\n            break\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing indices and conditions when working with array-based problems, especially in competitive programming contexts.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
