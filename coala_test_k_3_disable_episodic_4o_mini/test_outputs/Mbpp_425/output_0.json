    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that counts how many sublists (or inner lists) within a given list of lists contain a specific element.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each sublist in the main list. For each sublist, we will check if the specified element is present. If it is, we will increment a counter. Finally, we will return the counter which represents the total number of sublists containing the specified element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_element_in_list(list_of_lists, element):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           if element is in sublist:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_element_in_list(list_of_lists, element):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of sublists containing the element\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the main list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Check if the specified element is present in the current sublist\n        if element in sublist:\n            # If it is, increment the count\n            count += 1\n            \n    # Return the total count of sublists containing the element\n    return count\n```",
