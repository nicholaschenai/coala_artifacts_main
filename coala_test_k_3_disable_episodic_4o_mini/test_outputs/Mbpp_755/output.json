    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that finds the second smallest number in a list of integers. \n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the second smallest number, we can first identify the smallest number in the list. Then, we can iterate through the list again to find the smallest number that is greater than the smallest number we found initially. This will give us the second smallest number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `second_smallest` that takes a list of integers as input.\n   - Initialize a variable `smallest` to a very large value (infinity).\n   - Initialize a variable `second_smallest` to a very large value (infinity).\n   - Loop through each number in the list:\n     - If the number is less than `smallest`, update `second_smallest` to be `smallest`, and then update `smallest` to be the current number.\n     - Else if the number is greater than `smallest` and less than `second_smallest`, update `second_smallest` to be the current number.\n   - Return `second_smallest`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    # Initialize the smallest and second smallest to infinity\n    smallest = float('inf')\n    second_smallest = float('inf')\n    \n    # Loop through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Update smallest and second smallest accordingly\n        if number < smallest:\n            second_smallest = smallest\n            smallest = number\n        elif smallest < number < second_smallest:\n            second_smallest = number\n    \n    # Return the second smallest number found\n    return second_smallest\n```",
