    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of colors and a number `n`, and generates all possible combinations of the colors with repetition allowed. Each combination should be represented as a tuple, and the function should return a list of these tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to generate combinations. We will create a helper function that builds combinations by adding each color to the current combination until we reach the desired length `n`. When the combination reaches the required length, we will store it in a results list. This process will continue until all combinations are generated.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function combinations_helper(current_combination, colors, n, results):\n       if length of current_combination equals n:\n           add current_combination as a tuple to results\n           return\n       for each color in colors:\n           add color to current_combination\n           call combinations_helper with updated current_combination\n           remove last color from current_combination (backtrack)\n\n   function combinations_colors(colors, n):\n       results = empty list\n       call combinations_helper with empty current_combination\n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef combinations_helper(current_combination, colors, n, results):\n    # Base case: if the current combination has reached the desired length\n    if len(current_combination) == n:\n        results.append(tuple(current_combination))  # Store the combination as a tuple\n        return\n    # Iterate through each color to build combinations\n    for color in colors:\n        current_combination.append(color)  # Add the color to the current combination\n        combinations_helper(current_combination, colors, n, results)  # Recursive call\n        current_combination.pop()  # Backtrack to explore other combinations\n\ndef combinations_colors(colors, n):\n    results = []  # Initialize the results list\n    combinations_helper([], colors, n, results)  # Start the recursive combination generation\n    return results  # Return the list of combinations\n```",
