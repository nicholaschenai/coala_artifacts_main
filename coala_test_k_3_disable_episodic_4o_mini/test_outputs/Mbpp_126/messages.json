The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.\n\n    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. \n\n    Key code snippet for counting divisors:\n    ```python\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.\n\n    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.\n\n    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design.

Mathematically it is defined as:\n\n    $$\\gcd(a, b) = \\max \\{k > 0 : (k \\mid a) \\text{ and } (k \\mid b) \\}$$\n\n    (here the symbol \"$\\mid$\" denotes divisibility, i.e. \"$k \\mid a$\" means \"$k$ divides $a$\")\n\n    When one of the numbers is zero, while the other is non-zero, their greatest common divisor, by definition, is the second number. When both numbers are zero, their greatest common divisor is undefined (it can be any arbitrarily large number), but it is convenient to define it as zero as well to preserve the associativity of $\\gcd$. Which gives us a simple rule: if one of the numbers is zero, the greatest common divisor is the other number.\n\n    The Euclidean algorithm, discussed below, allows to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers $a$ and $b$ in $O(\\log \\min(a, b))$.\n\n    The algorithm was first described in Euclid's \"Elements\" (circa 300 BC), but it is possible that the algorithm has even earlier origins.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n\n    Originally, the Euclidean algorithm was formulated as follows: subtract the smaller number from the larger one until one of the numbers is zero. Indeed, if $g$ divides $a$ and $b$, it also divides $a-b$. On the other hand, if $g$ divides $a-b$ and $b$, then it also divides $a = b + (a-b)$, which means that the sets of the common divisors of $\\{a, b\\}$ and $\\{b,a-b\\}$ coincide.\n\n    Note that $a$ remains the larger number until $b$ is subtracted from it at least $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a}{b}\\right\\rfloor$ times. Therefore, to speed things up, $a-b$ is substituted with $a-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a}{b}\\right\\rfloor b = a \\bmod b$. Then the algorithm is formulated in an extremely simple way:\n\n    $$\\gcd(a, b) = \\begin{cases}a,&\\text{if }b = 0 \\\\ \\gcd(b, a \\bmod b),&\\text{otherwise.}\\end{cases}$$\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n    int gcd (int a, int b) {\n        if (b == 0)\n            return a;\n        else\n            return gcd (b, a % b);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Using the ternary operator in C++, we can write it as a one-liner.\n\n    ```cpp\n    int gcd (int a, int b) {\n        return b ? gcd (b, a % b) : a;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    And finally, here is a non-recursive implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int gcd (int a, int b) {\n        while (b) {\n            a %= b;\n            swap(a, b);\n        }\n        return a;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Note that since C++17, `gcd` is implemented as a [standard function](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/gcd) in C++.\n\n    ## Time Complexity\n\n    The running time of the algorithm is estimated by Lam\u00e9's theorem, which establishes a surprising connection between the Euclidean algorithm and the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n    If $a > b \\geq 1$ and $b < F_n$ for some $n$, the Euclidean algorithm performs at most $n-2$ recursive calls.\n\n    Moreover, it is possible to show that the upper bound of this theorem is optimal. When $a = F_n$ and $b = F_{n-1}$, $gcd(a, b)$ will perform exactly $n-2$ recursive calls. In other words, consecutive Fibonacci numbers are the worst case input for Euclid's algorithm.\n\n    Given that Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, we get that the Euclidean algorithm works in $O(\\log \\min(a, b))$.\n\n    Another way to estimate the complexity is to notice that $a \\bmod b$ for the case $a \\geq b$ is at least $2$ times smaller than $a$, so the larger number is reduced at least in half on each iteration of the algorithm.\n\n    ## Least common multiple\n\n    Calculating the least common multiple (commonly denoted **LCM**) can be reduced to calculating the GCD with the following simple formula:\n\n    $$\\text{lcm}(a, b) = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\gcd(a, b)}$$\n\n    Thus, LCM can be calculated using the Euclidean algorithm with the same time complexity:\n\n    A possible implementation, that cleverly avoids integer overflows by first dividing $a$ with the GCD, is given here:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int lcm (int a, int b) {\n        return a / gcd(a, b) * b;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Binary GCD\n\n    The Binary GCD algorithm is an optimization to the normal Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    The slow part of the normal algorithm are the modulo operations. Modulo operations, although we see them as $O(1)$, are a lot slower than simpler operations like addition, subtraction or bitwise operations.\n    So it would be better to avoid those.\n\n    It turns out, that you can design a fast GCD algorithm that avoids modulo operations.\n    It's based on a few properties:\n\n      - If both numbers are even, then we can factor out a two of both and compute the GCD of the remaining numbers: $\\gcd(2a, 2b) = 2 \\gcd(a, b)$.\n      - If one of the numbers is even and the other one is odd, then we can remove the factor 2 from the even one: $\\gcd(2a, b) = \\gcd(a, b)$ if $b$ is odd.\n      - If both numbers are odd, then subtracting one number of the other one will not change the GCD: $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a-b)$\n\n    Using only these properties, and some fast bitwise functions from GCC, we can implement a fast version:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int gcd(int a, int b) {\n        if (!a || !b)\n            return a | b;\n        unsigned shift = __builtin_ctz(a | b);\n        a >>= __builtin_ctz(a);\n        do {\n            b >>= __builtin_ctz(b);\n            if (a > b)\n                swap(a, b);\n            b -= a;\n        } while (b);\n        return a << shift;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Notice, that such an optimization is usually not necessary, and most programming languages already have a GCD function in their standard libraries.\n    E.g. C++17 has such a function `std::gcd` in the `numeric` header.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
