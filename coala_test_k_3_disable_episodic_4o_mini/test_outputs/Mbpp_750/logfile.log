    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

    In tackling the problem of accumulating scores for programming competition teams with scrambled names, my initial approach involved normalizing team names by sorting their characters and using a dictionary to store scores. While this method was fundamentally sound, it had a few shortcomings that I learned from.

    The official solution effectively uses a similar normalization strategy but optimizes the process by maintaining a list of tuples that directly associates the original team names with their scores. This allows for efficient updates and retrievals without losing the original names. The key steps in the official solution include:

    1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and the number of submissions efficiently.
    2. **Score Accumulation**: It uses a list to store scores and normalized names, allowing for direct access and updates when processing submissions.
    3. **Sorting and Output**: After accumulating scores, it sorts the list based on scores and outputs the results in the required format.

    One of the main insights from the official solution is the use of a list to store both the score and the original team name, which simplifies the process of updating scores and ensures that the original names are preserved for output. This contrasts with my initial implementation, where I lost track of the original names by using normalized names as dictionary keys.

    Additionally, the official solution's approach to sorting and outputting results is straightforward and efficient, ensuring that the final output meets the problem's requirements without unnecessary complexity.

    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of maintaining data integrity (in this case, preserving original names) while processing and accumulating results, as well as the value of efficient data structures for managing updates and retrievals.

[Summary]:
    In attempting to solve the problem of unflattening a list based on specific rules, I encountered several challenges related to correctly managing the direction of processing and handling sub-arrays. The core concept involved alternating the direction of processing (left to right, then right to left) and determining how many elements to take based on the remainder of the current number divided by the count of remaining elements.

    Initially, I implemented a function that attempted to toggle the direction after processing the entire array. However, this approach led to incorrect handling of indices and sub-arrays, resulting in runtime errors and failure to produce the expected output. The main issues were related to not properly skipping over elements that were included in sub-arrays and incorrectly resetting the index for the next run.

    The key strategies that did not work included:
    - Incorrectly managing the index after processing sub-arrays, which caused the function to either miss elements or exceed the bounds of the list.
    - Failing to correctly toggle the direction and set the index for the next run based on the direction of processing.

    To fix these issues, I needed to ensure that the index was adjusted correctly after processing each element or sub-array, and that the direction was toggled appropriately without losing track of the current position in the list. 

    The final implementation should focus on:
    - Correctly calculating the remainder and determining when to create sub-arrays.
    - Properly managing the index and direction to ensure all elements are processed as required.

    Here is the last attempted code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def unflatten(flat_array, depth):
        if depth == 0:
            return flat_array
    
        new_array = []
        direction = 1  # Start with left to right
        index = 0  # Starting index for left to right
    
        while index < len(flat_array):
            current_number = flat_array[index]
            remaining_elements = len(flat_array) - index
            remainder = current_number % remaining_elements
        
            if remainder < 3:
                new_array.append(current_number)
                index += 1
            else:
                sub_array = flat_array[index:index + remainder]
                new_array.append(unflatten(sub_array, depth - 1))
                index += remainder
        
            # Direction handling logic needs to be revisited for correctness
    
        return new_array
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing indices and understanding the flow of recursive functions, especially when dealing with nested structures.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
