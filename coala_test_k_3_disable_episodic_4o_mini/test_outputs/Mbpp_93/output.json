    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the result of raising a number 'a' to the power of 'b'. For example, if 'a' is 3 and 'b' is 4, the function should return 81, since 3 raised to the power of 4 equals 81.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a loop to multiply the base 'a' by itself 'b' times. We will start with a result variable initialized to 1, and in each iteration of the loop, we will multiply the result by 'a'. After completing 'b' iterations, the result will hold the value of 'a' raised to the power of 'b'.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function power(a, b):\n       initialize result to 1\n       for i from 1 to b:\n           result = result * a\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef power(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the result to 1\n    result = 1\n    # Loop b times to multiply a with itself\n    for i in range(b):\n        result *= a\n    # Return the final result\n    return result\n```",
