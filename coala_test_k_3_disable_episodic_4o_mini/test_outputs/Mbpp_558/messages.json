The key concept was to maintain a list of dictionaries (`dp`), where each dictionary at index `i` tracks the lengths of subsequences for each possible difference between elements up to that index. \n\n    The algorithm iterates through each element in the array and, for each pair of elements, calculates the difference. It updates the length of the arithmetic subsequence in the corresponding dictionary and keeps track of the maximum length found. This approach effectively captures the relationships between elements and their differences, allowing for efficient updates and retrievals.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def longestArithSeqLength(self, A: list[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(A)\n            if n < 2:\n                return n\n        \n            dp = [{} for _ in range(n)]\n            max_length = 0\n        \n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    diff = A[i] - A[j]\n                    if diff not in dp[i]:\n                        dp[i][diff] = 0\n                    dp[i][diff] = max(dp[i][diff], dp[j].get(diff, 0) + 1)\n                    max_length = max(max_length, dp[i][diff] + 1)\n        \n            return max_length\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving problems involving subsequences and highlighted the utility of using dictionaries for efficient lookups and updates.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of p allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers A and B. The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.\n\n    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. \n\n    Key code snippet for counting divisors:\n    ```python\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted array of integers. The solution utilized a dynamic programming approach, which is a common strategy for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index, updating it based on previous elements.\n\n    The implemented algorithm iterated through the input array, comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length of the subsequence was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by taking the maximum value from the array that tracked the lengths.\n\n    The code snippet for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            d = [1] * len(nums)\n        \n            for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This approach runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem constraints. The solution was successful, passing all tests, indicating that the dynamic programming strategy was effective in this case. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
