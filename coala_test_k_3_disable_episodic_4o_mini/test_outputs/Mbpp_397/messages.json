The core concepts involved understanding how to manipulate a list based on user input and efficiently compute results for different types of queries.\n\n    The solution involved defining helper functions to find the second maximum and second minimum values, which required handling unique values and sorting. The main function processed input queries, updating the list or calculating results based on the specified operation type. I ensured to handle edge cases, such as when there are not enough unique values for second max/min queries, returning \"NA\" when necessary.\n\n    The implementation was straightforward, and all operations were executed in a linear manner, which is acceptable given the constraints. The code passed all provided test cases, indicating that the logic was sound and the operations were correctly implemented. Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of clear input handling and efficient list operations in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Greedy algorithms\n    Section: Minimizing sums\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Minimizing sums}\n\n    We next consider a problem where\n    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$\n    and our task is to find a value $x$\n    that minimizes the sum\n    \\[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\\]\n    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Case $c=1$}\n\n    In this case, we should minimize the sum\n    \\[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\\cdots+|a_n-x|.\\]\n    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,\n    the best solution is to select $x=2$\n    which produces the sum\n    \\[\n    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.\n    \\]\n    In the general case, the best choice for $x$\n    is the \\textit{median} of the numbers,\n    i.e., the middle number after sorting.\n    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$\n    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,\n    so the median is 2.\n\n    The median is an optimal choice,\n    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,\n    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,\n    and if $x$ is larger then the median,\n    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.\n    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$\n    is the median.\n    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,\n    both medians and all values between them\n    are optimal choices.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Case $c=2$}\n\n    In this case, we should minimize the sum\n    \\[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\\]\n    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,\n    the best solution is to select $x=4$\n    which produces the sum\n    \\[\n    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.\n    \\]\n    In the general case, the best choice for $x$\n    is the \\emph{average} of the numbers.\n    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.\n    This result can be derived by presenting\n    the sum as follows:\n    \\[\n    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\\cdots+a_n^2)\n    \\]\n    The last part does not depend on $x$,\n    so we can ignore it.\n    The remaining parts form a function\n    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n$.\n    This is a parabola opening upwards\n    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,\n    and the minimum value is the average\n    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,\n    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine if a right-angled triangle could be formed with a given hypotenuse \\( H \\) and area \\( S \\). The solution involved using the properties of right triangles, specifically the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. \n\n    The approach was to derive a quadratic equation based on the relationship between the sides and the area, and then solve for the lengths of the legs of the triangle. The discriminant of the quadratic equation was crucial in determining whether valid triangle sides could be found. If the discriminant was negative, it indicated that no valid triangle could be formed.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled multiple test cases and formatted the output correctly. Key points included ensuring that the sides were sorted and that the output precision met the requirements. The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.\n\n    Here\u2019s the core function used to find the triangle:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_triangle(H, S):\n        area_double = 2 * S\n        discriminant = H**4 - 4 * (area_double**2)\n    \n        if discriminant < 0:\n            return -1\n    \n        a1 = ((H**2 + discriminant**0.5) / 2)**0.5\n        a2 = ((H**2 - discriminant**0.5) / 2)**0.5\n        b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5\n        b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5\n    \n        sides1 = sorted([a1, b1, H])\n        sides2 = sorted([a2, b2, H])\n    \n        if sides1[0] > 0 and sides1[1] > 0:\n            return sides1\n        if sides2[0] > 0 and sides2[1] > 0:\n            return sides2\n    \n        return -1\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric properties and their mathematical implications in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
