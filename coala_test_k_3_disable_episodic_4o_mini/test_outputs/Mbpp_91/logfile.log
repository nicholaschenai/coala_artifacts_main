INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/91 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a specific substring exists within any of the strings in a given list. The function should return `True` if the substring is found in at least one of the strings, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each string in the provided list. For each string, we will check if the substring is present using the `in` keyword in Python. If we find the substring in any of the strings, we will return `True`. If we finish checking all strings without finding the substring, we will return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   FUNCTION find_substring(string_list, substring):
       FOR each string in string_list:
           IF substring is found in string:
               RETURN True
       RETURN False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_substring(string_list, substring):
    # Iterate through each string in the provided list
    for string in string_list:
        # Check if the substring is present in the current string
        if substring in string:
            # If found, return True
            return True
    # If the loop completes without finding the substring, return False
    return False
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". Initially, I incorrectly checked for the substring "not" in the quotes, which led to misclassifications when "not" appeared as part of other words (e.g., "nothing"). 

    The key concept was to ensure that "not" was treated as a standalone word. The solution required splitting each quote into individual words and checking for the presence of "not" in that list. This approach effectively resolved the issue.

    The final working code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def classify_quotes():
        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(input())
    
        # Process each quote
        for _ in range(T):
            # Read the quote
            S = input()
        
            # Split the quote into words
            words = S.split()
        
            # Check if the word "not" is in the list of words
            if "not" in words:
                print("Real Fancy")  # Classify as Real Fancy
            else:
                print("regularly fancy")  # Classify as regularly fancy

    # Call the function to execute the solution
    classify_quotes()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and ensuring that checks for specific words are done correctly, especially in string manipulation tasks.
