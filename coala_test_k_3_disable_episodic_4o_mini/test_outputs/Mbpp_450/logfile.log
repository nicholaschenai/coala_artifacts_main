INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/450 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing only those strings that have a specific length. The length we are interested in is 8 characters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each string in the provided list. For each string, we will check its length. If the length of the string is equal to 8, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing only the strings of the specified length.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function extract_string(string_list, length):
       create an empty list called result
       for each string in string_list:
           if the length of the string is equal to length:
               add the string to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def extract_string(string_list, length):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    # Iterate through each string in the provided list
    for string in string_list:
        # Check if the length of the string is equal to the specified length
        if len(string) == length:
            # If it is, add the string to the result list
            result.append(string)
    # Return the list of strings that match the specified length
    return result

# The function can be called with the example provided:
# extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'], 8)

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by iterating through each character in the string and considering all possible positions for reinserting that character. The key insight is the use of the `min` function to keep track of the lexicographically smallest string encountered during the iterations. This approach is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in string comparison capabilities.

    One notable aspect of the official solution is its simplicity and clarity. It maintains a single variable `answer` initialized to the original string, which is updated whenever a smaller string is found. This avoids the need for an additional list to store results, making the code more concise.

    In terms of performance, both the official solution and my approach have similar time complexity, as they both involve nested loops iterating through the string. However, the official solution is slightly more efficient in terms of space since it does not require an extra list to store intermediate results.

    Overall, the official solution reinforces the importance of leveraging built-in functions for comparisons and maintaining clarity in variable usage. It serves as a reminder to focus on simplicity and efficiency in problem-solving.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.
