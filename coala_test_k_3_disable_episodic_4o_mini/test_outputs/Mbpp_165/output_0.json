    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that counts how many characters in a given string are in the same position as they are in the English alphabet. The comparison should be case insensitive, meaning 'A' and 'a' are treated the same.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each character in the string and check if its position (1-based index) matches its corresponding position in the English alphabet. For example, 'a' or 'A' should match position 1, 'b' or 'B' should match position 2, and so on. We will maintain a count of how many characters match their respective positions.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_char_position(s):\n       initialize count to 0\n       convert string s to lowercase\n       for each index i from 0 to length of s - 1:\n           if character at index i is equal to (i + 1) in alphabet:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_char_position(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize a count to keep track of matching characters\n    count = 0\n    # Convert the string to lowercase for case insensitive comparison\n    s = s.lower()\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Check if the character matches its position in the alphabet\n        # 'a' is at position 1, so we compare with (i + 1)\n        if ord(s[i]) - ord('a') + 1 == i + 1:\n            count += 1  # Increment count if there's a match\n    \n    return count  # Return the total count of matching characters\n```",
