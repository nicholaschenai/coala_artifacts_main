The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine the number of ways to remove a non-empty contiguous subsequence from a given sequence of integers such that the remaining sequence is non-empty and strictly increasing. The solution involved iterating through all possible contiguous subsequences to remove and checking if the remaining sequence met the strictly increasing condition.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate and evaluate subsequences efficiently. The approach involved two nested loops to consider all possible starting and ending indices for the subsequence to be removed. After forming the remaining sequence, a helper function was used to check if it was strictly increasing.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was straightforward. The helper function `is_strictly_increasing` was crucial for validating the remaining sequence. The solution was efficient enough given the constraints, but it could be optimized further for larger inputs by avoiding the creation of new lists for the remaining sequence.\n\n    Here\u2019s the key code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_strictly_increasing(sequence):\n        for i in range(1, len(sequence)):\n            if sequence[i] <= sequence[i - 1]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def count_ways_to_remove_subsequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n            count = 0\n        \n            for start in range(N):\n                for end in range(start, N):\n                    remaining_sequence = A[0:start] + A[end + 1:N]\n                    if remaining_sequence and is_strictly_increasing(remaining_sequence):\n                        count += 1\n        \n            print(count)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding subsequences and their properties, as well as the need for efficient checks when dealing with potentially large datasets.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to find the number of ways to express a natural number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \\( K \\). The solution involved a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the valid combinations without repeating calculations.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the use of recursion to explore combinations while ensuring uniqueness of integers. The recursive function `countWays` was designed to track the current sum and the last integer used, preventing the reuse of integers. Memoization was implemented to store previously computed results for specific states, which significantly improved performance.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, reading multiple test cases and producing the correct results. The code was structured to first define helper functions and then the main function, adhering to the specified format. Overall, the approach was effective, and the solution passed all provided test cases without errors. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countWays(N, K, current, last, memo):\n        # Base case: if current sum equals N, we found a valid way\n        if current == N:\n            return 1\n        # If current sum exceeds N, this path is invalid\n        if current > N:\n            return 0\n        # Check if the result is already computed\n        if (current, last) in memo:\n            return memo[(current, last)]\n    \n        totalWays = 0\n        # Start from the next integer after 'last'\n        for i in range(last + 1, N + 1):\n            totalWays += countWays(N, K, current + i**K, i, memo)\n    \n        # Store the result in memoization dictionary\n        memo[(current, last)] = totalWays\n        return totalWays\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recursion and memoization in solving combinatorial problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
