    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the first odd number found in that list. If there are no odd numbers, the function should not return anything specific, but we will assume it returns `None` in such cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list of numbers one by one. For each number, we will check if it is odd (a number is odd if it is not divisible by 2). The first odd number we encounter will be returned immediately. If we finish checking all numbers without finding an odd number, we will return `None`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function first_odd(numbers):\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is odd:\n               return number\n       return None\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_odd(number):\n    # Check if the number is odd\n    return number % 2 != 0\n\ndef first_odd(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is odd\n        if is_odd(number):\n            # Return the first odd number found\n            return number\n    # If no odd number is found, return None\n    return None\n```",
