The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to find the number of ways to express a natural number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \\( K \\). The solution involved a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the valid combinations without repeating calculations.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the use of recursion to explore combinations while ensuring uniqueness of integers. The recursive function `countWays` was designed to track the current sum and the last integer used, preventing the reuse of integers. Memoization was implemented to store previously computed results for specific states, which significantly improved performance.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, reading multiple test cases and producing the correct results. The code was structured to first define helper functions and then the main function, adhering to the specified format. Overall, the approach was effective, and the solution passed all provided test cases without errors. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countWays(N, K, current, last, memo):\n        # Base case: if current sum equals N, we found a valid way\n        if current == N:\n            return 1\n        # If current sum exceeds N, this path is invalid\n        if current > N:\n            return 0\n        # Check if the result is already computed\n        if (current, last) in memo:\n            return memo[(current, last)]\n    \n        totalWays = 0\n        # Start from the next integer after 'last'\n        for i in range(last + 1, N + 1):\n            totalWays += countWays(N, K, current + i**K, i, memo)\n    \n        # Store the result in memoization dictionary\n        memo[(current, last)] = totalWays\n        return totalWays\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recursion and memoization in solving combinatorial problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\n    The official solution provided a more efficient and concise approach to converting a number to a specified base, particularly with the handling of both integer and fractional parts. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Use of Mathematical Functions**: The official solution utilizes the `log` function to determine the maximum power of the base that fits into the number. This is a more efficient way to handle the conversion compared to repeatedly dividing the number.\n\n    2. **Handling of Digits**: The solution uses a predefined string `DIGS` to map numeric values to their corresponding characters for bases greater than 10. This simplifies the conversion process and avoids the need for conditional checks during digit conversion.\n\n    3. **Efficient Looping**: The loop iterates over a range that includes both the fractional and integer parts, allowing for a single pass to build the result string. This contrasts with my approach, which separated the integer and fractional conversions into different sections.\n\n    4. **Negative Numbers**: The solution handles negative numbers by prepending a '-' sign based on the condition of `n`, which is a clean and effective way to manage the sign.\n\n    5. **Output Formatting**: The official solution constructs the output string in a single list and joins it at the end, which is generally more efficient than concatenating strings directly.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways\n    - Using mathematical properties (like logarithms) can simplify the problem and improve performance.\n    - Predefined mappings for digits can streamline the conversion process.\n    - Combining the handling of integer and fractional parts into a single loop can reduce complexity and improve readability.\n    - Efficient string construction techniques (like using lists) can enhance performance in Python.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is more elegant and efficient than my initial attempts, highlighting the importance of leveraging mathematical insights and efficient data structures in programming challenges.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
