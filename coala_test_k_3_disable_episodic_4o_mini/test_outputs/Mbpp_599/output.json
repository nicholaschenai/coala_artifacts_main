    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the sum and average of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should return these two values as a tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, we can use the formula `sum = n * (n + 1) / 2`. The average can be calculated by dividing the sum by `n`. The function will take an integer `n` as input and return a tuple containing the sum and the average.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum_average(n):\n       if n is less than or equal to 0:\n           return (0, 0)  // Handle edge case\n       sum = n * (n + 1) / 2  // Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers\n       average = sum / n  // Calculate the average\n       return (sum, average)  // Return the result as a tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sum_average(n):\n    # Handle edge case where n is less than or equal to 0\n    if n <= 0:\n        return (0, 0)  # Return (0, 0) for non-positive n\n    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula\n    total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Use integer division for sum\n    # Calculate the average\n    average = total_sum / n  # Average is the sum divided by n\n    # Return the sum and average as a tuple\n    return (total_sum, average)  # Return the result\n```",
