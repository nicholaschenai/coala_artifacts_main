INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/639 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of names and calculates the total length of the names that start with an uppercase letter. Any names that start with a lowercase letter should be ignored in this calculation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each name in the provided list.
   - For each name, we will check if the first character is uppercase.
   - If it is uppercase, we will add the length of that name to a running total.
   - Finally, we will return the total length of all the names that started with an uppercase letter.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sample_nam(names):
       initialize total_length to 0
       for each name in names:
           if the first character of name is uppercase:
               add the length of name to total_length
       return total_length
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sample_nam(names):
    # Initialize a variable to hold the total length of valid names
    total_length = 0
    
    # Iterate through each name in the provided list
    for name in names:
        # Check if the first character of the name is uppercase
        if name and name[0].isupper():
            # Add the length of the name to the total length
            total_length += len(name)
    
    # Return the total length of names that start with an uppercase letter
    return total_length

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main challenge was to correctly handle team names that could be presented in any order due to character rearrangement. The goal was to accumulate scores for each team based on their submissions while ensuring that teams with the same character composition were treated as identical.

    The initial approach involved using a normalized version of the team names (sorted characters) as keys in a dictionary to accumulate scores. However, this led to the loss of the original team names, which was crucial for the final output. The output format required the original team names to be printed alongside their scores, sorted by score and then lexicographically by name.

    The solution was refined by storing tuples in the dictionary that included both the original team name and the accumulated score. This allowed for proper retrieval and sorting of results. The final implementation successfully passed all tests by ensuring that the output matched the expected format.

    Key takeaways:
    - Always retain necessary information (like original names) when normalizing data for processing.
    - Sorting and output formatting are critical in competitive programming problems, especially when multiple criteria are involved. 

    Final working code snippet:
    ```python
    def main():

        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()

        for _ in range(T):
            N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
            index += 1
        
            scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
            # Process first half hour submissions
            for _ in range(R):
                line = data[index].split()
                team_name = line[0]
                points = int(line[1])
                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name
                if normalized_name not in scores:
                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score
                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)

            result = [(name, score) for normalized_name, (name, score) in scores.items()]
            # Sort by score (descending) and then by team name (lexicographical)
            result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
            # Print the results

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:

                        break

            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):

                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases

    The solution was refined by storing tuples in the dictionary that included both the original team name and the accumulated score. This allowed for proper retrieval and sorting of results. The final implementation successfully passed all tests by ensuring that the output matched the expected format.

    Key takeaways:
    - Always retain necessary information (like original names) when normalizing data for processing.
    - Sorting and output formatting are critical in competitive programming problems, especially when multiple criteria are involved. 

    Final working code snippet:
    ```python
    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
            index += 1
        
            scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
            # Process first half hour submissions
            for _ in range(R):
                line = data[index].split()
                team_name = line[0]
                points = int(line[1])
                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name
                if normalized_name not in scores:
                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score
                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)
                index += 1
        
            # Process remaining submissions
            for _ in range(N - R):
                line = data[index].split()
                team_name = line[0]
                points = int(line[1])
                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name
                if normalized_name not in scores:
                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score
                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)
                index += 1
        
            # Prepare result for sorting
            result = [(name, score) for normalized_name, (name, score) in scores.items()]
            # Sort by score (descending) and then by team name (lexicographical)
            result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
            # Print the results
            for team_name, score in result:
                print(team_name, score)

    # Call the main function to execute the code
    main()
    ```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/639 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of names and calculates the total length of the names that do not start with a lowercase letter. Names that start with a lowercase letter should be ignored in the length calculation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will iterate through the list of names.
   - For each name, we will check if the first character is an uppercase letter.
   - If it is, we will add the length of that name to a running total.
   - Finally, we will return the total length.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sum_length_of_names(names):
       total_length = 0
       for each name in names:
           if the first character of name is uppercase:
               total_length += length of name
       return total_length
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sum_length_of_names(names):
    # Initialize total length to 0
    total_length = 0
    
    # Iterate through each name in the list
    for name in names:
        # Check if the first character is uppercase
        if name and name[0].isupper():
            # Add the length of the name to the total length
            total_length += len(name)
    
    # Return the total length of names that start with an uppercase letter
    return total_length
