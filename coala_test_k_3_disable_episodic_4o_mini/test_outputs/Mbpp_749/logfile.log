   - Convert each string in the list to an integer.
   - Sort the list of integers in ascending order.
   - Return the sorted list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sort_numeric_strings(input_list):
       create an empty list called integer_list
       for each string in input_list:
           convert the string to an integer and add it to integer_list

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems based on their calculated difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.

    2. **Data Structure**: It uses a dictionary (`scores`) to map the difficulty score (n) to a list of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping of problems with the same difficulty.

    3. **Pairing and Sorting**: For each problem, the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask are paired using a dictionary. The scores are then sorted, which simplifies the comparison of contestant numbers.

    4. **Counting Decreases**: The solution counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases as it moves through the sorted scores. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent elements.

    5. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores for all problems, the solution sorts the unique difficulty scores and then sorts the problem indices for each score before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the required order.

    6. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.

    In contrast to my initial approach, the official solution is more concise and leverages Python's built-in data structures effectively. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly mapping scores to problem indices, which simplifies the sorting and output process. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can simplify grouping and sorting tasks in programming challenges.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main challenge was to correctly handle team names that could be presented in any order due to character rearrangement. The goal was to accumulate scores for each team based on their submissions while ensuring that teams with the same character composition were treated as identical.

    The initial approach involved using a normalized version of the team names (sorted characters) as keys in a dictionary to accumulate scores. However, this led to the loss of the original team names, which was crucial for the final output. The output format required the original team names to be printed alongside their scores, sorted by score and then lexicographically by name.

    The solution was refined by storing tuples in the dictionary that included both the original team name and the accumulated score. This allowed for proper retrieval and sorting of results. The final implementation successfully passed all tests by ensuring that the output matched the expected format.

    Key takeaways:
    - Always retain necessary information (like original names) when normalizing data for processing.
    - Sorting and output formatting are critical in competitive programming problems, especially when multiple criteria are involved. 

    Final working code snippet:
    ```python
    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
            index += 1
        
            scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
            # Process first half hour submissions
            for _ in range(R):
                line = data[index].split()
                team_name = line[0]
                points = int(line[1])
                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name
                if normalized_name not in scores:
                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score
                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)
                index += 1

            for _ in range(N - R):
                line = data[index].split()

                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)
                index += 1
        
            # Prepare result for sorting
            result = [(name, score) for normalized_name, (name, score) in scores.items()]
            # Sort by score (descending) and then by team name (lexicographical)
            result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
            # Print the results
            for team_name, score in result:
                print(team_name, score)

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I implemented a solution to find the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concept involved identifying the rightmost ascent in the permutation, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.

    The implementation followed a clear structure: a helper function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution successfully handled multiple permutations as specified in the problem statement.

    One key takeaway is the importance of understanding the mechanics of generating permutations, particularly the lexicographic order. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. The code was tested against sample inputs, and it produced the expected outputs, confirming its correctness. 

    Here’s the essential code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def next_permutation(arr):
        i = len(arr) - 2
        while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:
            i -= 1
        if i == -1:
            arr.reverse()
            return arr
        j = len(arr) - 1
        while arr[j] <= arr[i]:
            j -= 1
        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])
        return arr

    def main():
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        results = []
        for _ in range(K):
            permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))
            next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, next_perm)))
        print("\n".join(results))

    main()
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the solution's structure, which can be useful for similar tasks in the future.
