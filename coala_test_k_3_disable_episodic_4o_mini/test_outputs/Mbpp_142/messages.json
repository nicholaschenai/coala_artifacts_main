However, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient implementation.\n\n    **Key Insights from the Official Solution:**\n    1. **Use of Indexing**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides directly. This approach simplifies the checking process by avoiding multiple conditional statements and instead iterating through predefined combinations.\n  \n    2. **Set for Uniqueness**: The official solution leverages the `set` data structure to check if all three colors are the same. By converting the list of colors to a set, it effectively checks for uniqueness in a single line, which is both elegant and efficient.\n\n    3. **Control Flow**: The use of a counter (`c`) to track whether a match was found is straightforward, but the official solution could be further simplified by directly printing \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on the condition without needing an additional variable.\n\n    **Comparison with My Approach**:\n    - My solution explicitly checked each combination with multiple `or` conditions, which, while clear, could be seen as verbose compared to the official solution's use of a loop over a predefined list of combinations.\n    - The official solution's use of `set` for checking color equality is a more Pythonic approach, reducing the complexity of the condition checks.\n\n    ### Conclusion\n    The official solution is more efficient in terms of readability and maintainability. It highlights the importance of leveraging built-in data structures and concise control flow in Python. In future problems, I will aim to adopt similar strategies to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of triangles that can be formed using points of the same color from a given list of colored lattice points. The solution required organizing points by color, calculating combinations of points to form triangles, and checking for collinearity to ensure valid triangles.\n\n    Key concepts included:\n    - Using combinations from the `itertools` library to generate sets of three points.\n    - Applying the determinant method to check for collinearity, which is essential for validating triangle formation.\n    - Managing output formatting to match the expected structure, particularly ensuring that if no triangles can be formed, the output should reflect that with an empty list for colors.\n\n    Initially, the code failed to handle cases where no triangles could be formed, incorrectly including colors in the output. This was fixed by checking if the total triangle count was zero and returning an empty list for colors in that case. \n\n    The final working solution effectively organized points, counted valid triangles, and formatted the output correctly:\n\n    ```python\n    def count_col_triang(points):\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        from itertools import combinations\n\n        # Organize points by color\n        color_points = defaultdict(list)\n        for point in points:\n            color_points[point[1]].append(point[0])\n\n        # Initialize results\n        total_points = len(points)\n        unique_colors = len(color_points)\n        total_triangles = 0\n        triangle_counts = {}\n\n        # Calculate triangles for each color\n        for color, pts in color_points.items():\n            num_points = len(pts)\n            if num_points >= 3:\n                triangles = 0\n                for comb in combinations(pts, 3):\n                    x1, y1 = comb[0]\n                    x2, y2 = comb[1]\n                    x3, y3 = comb[2]\n                    if (x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)) != 0:\n                        triangles += 1\n                triangle_counts[color] = triangles\n                total_triangles += triangles\n\n        # Determine maximum triangle count and colors\n        max_triangles = 0\n        max_colors = []\n        for color, count in triangle_counts.items():\n            if count > max_triangles:\n                max_triangles = count\n                max_colors = [color]\n            elif count == max_triangles:\n                max_colors.append(color)\n\n        # Prepare final output\n        if total_triangles == 0:\n            return [total_points, unique_colors, total_triangles, []]\n    \n        max_color_count = triangle_counts[max_colors[0]] if max_colors else 0\n        return [total_points, unique_colors, total_triangles, [*sorted(max_colors), max_color_count]]\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful output formatting and handling edge cases in algorithmic problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
