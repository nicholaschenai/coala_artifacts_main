    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary of students, where each student has a name and a tuple containing their height and weight. The function should filter out students who do not meet the minimum height and weight requirements, returning a new dictionary with only those who do.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through each student in the input dictionary.\n   - For each student, we will check if their height and weight are both greater than or equal to the specified minimum values.\n   - If they meet the criteria, we will add them to a new dictionary that will be returned at the end.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function filter_data(students, min_height, min_weight):\n       create an empty dictionary called filtered_students\n       for each student in students:\n           get the student's height and weight from the tuple\n           if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight:\n               add the student to filtered_students\n       return filtered_students\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef filter_data(students, min_height, min_weight):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to hold the filtered students\n    filtered_students = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each student in the input dictionary\n    for student, (height, weight) in students.items():\n        # Check if the student's height and weight meet the minimum requirements\n        if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight:\n            # If they do, add them to the filtered_students dictionary\n            filtered_students[student] = (height, weight)\n    \n    # Return the dictionary of filtered students\n    return filtered_students\n```",
