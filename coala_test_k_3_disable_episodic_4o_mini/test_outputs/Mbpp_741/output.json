    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that checks if all characters in a given string are the same. If they are, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if all characters in the string are the same, we can compare each character in the string to the first character. If we find any character that is different from the first one, we can conclude that not all characters are the same and return `False`. If we finish checking all characters without finding any differences, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function all_Characters_Same(s):\n       if the string is empty:\n           return True\n       first_character = s[0]\n       for each character in s:\n           if character is not equal to first_character:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is empty\n    if not s:\n        return True  # An empty string can be considered as having all same characters\n    first_character = s[0]  # Store the first character of the string\n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for character in s:\n        # If any character is different from the first one\n        if character != first_character:\n            return False  # Not all characters are the same\n    return True  # All characters are the same\n```",
