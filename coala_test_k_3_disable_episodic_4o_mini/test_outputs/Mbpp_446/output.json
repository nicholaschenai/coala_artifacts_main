    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that counts how many times specific elements from a list appear in a given tuple. The function should return the total count of occurrences of those elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of elements we want to count. For each element, we will check how many times it appears in the tuple. We will maintain a running total of these counts and return the final total.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_Occurrence(tuple, list):\n       initialize total_count to 0\n       for each element in list:\n           count occurrences of element in tuple\n           add this count to total_count\n       return total_count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_Occurrence(tup, lst):\n    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the total count\n    total_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # Count how many times the element appears in the tuple\n        count = tup.count(element)\n        # Add the count to the total count\n        total_count += count\n    \n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return total_count\n```",
