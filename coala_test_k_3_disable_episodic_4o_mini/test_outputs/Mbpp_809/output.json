    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that checks if every element in the second tuple is smaller than the corresponding element in the first tuple. If all elements in the second tuple are smaller, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We will iterate through both tuples simultaneously, comparing each pair of corresponding elements. If we find any element in the second tuple that is not smaller than its counterpart in the first tuple, we will return `False`. If we finish checking all pairs without finding such a case, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n       for each index i from 0 to length of tuple1:\n           if tuple2[i] is not less than tuple1[i]:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Iterate through the indices of the tuples\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Check if the element in tuple2 is not smaller than the corresponding element in tuple1\n        if tuple2[i] >= tuple1[i]:\n            return False  # Return False if any element in tuple2 is not smaller\n    return True  # Return True if all elements in tuple2 are smaller\n\n# The function can be called with two tuples as arguments\n```",
