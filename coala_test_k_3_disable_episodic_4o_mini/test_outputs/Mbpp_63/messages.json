The core concept involved breaking down the problem into two parts: calculating the maximum profit from the first transaction and then the second transaction.

By iterating through the prices and updating these arrays, I was able to combine the results to find the overall maximum profit.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases.

The core concept involved breaking down the problem into two parts: calculating the maximum profit from the first transaction and then the second transaction. This approach utilized dynamic programming to keep track of profits at each step.\n\n    The solution involved creating two arrays: `first_profit` to store the maximum profit achievable up to each day and `second_profit` to store the maximum profit achievable from each day onward. By iterating through the prices and updating these arrays, I was able to combine the results to find the overall maximum profit.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key strategies that worked well included maintaining a running minimum and maximum price to efficiently calculate profits without needing nested loops, which would have increased the time complexity. This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and leveraging dynamic programming techniques for optimization. \n\n    Here is the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(prices)\n            if n == 0:\n                return 0\n        \n            first_profit = [0] * n\n            min_price = prices[0]\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])\n                first_profit[i] = max(first_profit[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)\n        \n            second_profit = [0] * n\n            max_price = prices[-1]\n        \n            for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n                max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])\n                second_profit[i] = max(second_profit[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])\n        \n            max_profit = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                max_profit = max(max_profit, first_profit[i] + second_profit[i])\n        \n            return max_profit\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of finding the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in an array of integers, I utilized a dynamic programming approach.
