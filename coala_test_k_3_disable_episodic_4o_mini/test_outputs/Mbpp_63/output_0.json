    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The goal is to find the maximum difference between the first element of one tuple and the second element of another tuple from the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each tuple in the list and calculate the difference between the first element of one tuple and the second element of another tuple. We will keep track of the maximum difference found during this process. \n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Initialize a variable `max_diff` to store the maximum difference found, starting at a very small number (like negative infinity).\n   - Loop through each tuple in the list:\n     - For each tuple, loop through all other tuples:\n       - Calculate the difference between the first element of the current tuple and the second element of the other tuple.\n       - If this difference is greater than `max_diff`, update `max_diff`.\n   - Return `max_diff` as the result.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_difference(tuples_list):\n    # Initialize the maximum difference to a very small number\n    max_diff = float('-inf')\n    \n    # Loop through each tuple in the list\n    for i in range(len(tuples_list)):\n        for j in range(len(tuples_list)):\n            if i != j:  # Ensure we are not comparing the same tuple\n                # Calculate the difference between the first element of tuple i\n                # and the second element of tuple j\n                diff = tuples_list[i][0] - tuples_list[j][1]\n                # Update max_diff if the current difference is greater\n                if diff > max_diff:\n                    max_diff = diff\n    \n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_diff\n\n# The function is declared last as per the instructions.\n```",
