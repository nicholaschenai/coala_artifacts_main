    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces all whitespace characters (spaces) with underscores (`_`) and all underscores with spaces. \n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: We will iterate through each character in the input string. If the character is a space, we will replace it with an underscore. If the character is an underscore, we will replace it with a space. For all other characters, we will keep them unchanged. Finally, we will join the modified characters back into a single string and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `replace_spaces` that takes a string `s`.\n   - Initialize an empty list `result` to store the modified characters.\n   - Loop through each character `char` in the string `s`:\n     - If `char` is a space, append an underscore to `result`.\n     - If `char` is an underscore, append a space to `result`.\n     - Otherwise, append `char` to `result`.\n   - Join the list `result` into a single string and return it.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef replace_spaces(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the modified characters\n    result = []\n    \n    # Loop through each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # Replace space with underscore\n        if char == ' ':\n            result.append('_')\n        # Replace underscore with space\n        elif char == '_':\n            result.append(' ')\n        # Keep other characters unchanged\n        else:\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a single string and return it\n    return ''.join(result)\n```",
