However, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient implementation.\n\n    **Key Insights from the Official Solution:**\n    1. **Use of Indexing**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides directly. This approach simplifies the checking process by avoiding multiple conditional statements and instead iterating through predefined combinations.\n  \n    2. **Set for Uniqueness**: The official solution leverages the `set` data structure to check if all three colors are the same. By converting the list of colors to a set, it effectively checks for uniqueness in a single line, which is both elegant and efficient.\n\n    3. **Control Flow**: The use of a counter (`c`) to track whether a match was found is straightforward, but the official solution could be further simplified by directly printing \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on the condition without needing an additional variable.\n\n    **Comparison with My Approach**:\n    - My solution explicitly checked each combination with multiple `or` conditions, which, while clear, could be seen as verbose compared to the official solution's use of a loop over a predefined list of combinations.\n    - The official solution's use of `set` for checking color equality is a more Pythonic approach, reducing the complexity of the condition checks.\n\n    ### Conclusion\n    The official solution is more efficient in terms of readability and maintainability. It highlights the importance of leveraging built-in data structures and concise control flow in Python. In future problems, I will aim to adopt similar strategies to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective attendance frequencies. The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.\n\n    The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.\n\n    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.\n\n    Key code snippets included:\n    ```python\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            temp = b\n            b = a % b\n            a = temp\n        return a\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\n    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):\n        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)\n\n    def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):\n        total_hours = N * 24\n        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        return total_hours // lcm_value\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine if three adjacent sides of a cube were painted the same color based on given test cases. The solution involved checking specific combinations of adjacent sides for color matches. \n\n    The core concept tested was understanding the spatial relationships of a cube's sides and efficiently checking for color equality among them. The eight combinations of adjacent sides were identified and checked using simple conditional statements.\n\n    The initial implementation was correct in logic but required clarity and adherence to the problem's constraints. The final solution efficiently processed each test case in constant time, leading to an overall complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases.\n\n    Key code snippet for checking adjacent sides:\n    ```python\n    if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # front, left, top\n        colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # front, right, top\n        colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # front, left, bottom\n        colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # front, right, bottom\n        colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # back, left, top\n        colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # back, right, top\n        colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # back, left, bottom\n        colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):    # back, right, bottom\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships in programming problems and the need for clear, efficient code.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
