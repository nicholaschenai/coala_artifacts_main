INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/754 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes three lists as input and returns a new list containing elements that are the same in all three lists at the same index.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the indices of the lists. For each index, we will check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same. If they are, we will add that element to a new list. Finally, we will return the new list containing all the common elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
       create an empty list called common_elements
       for index from 0 to the length of l1 (or l2 or l3):
           if l1[index] is equal to l2[index] and l2[index] is equal to l3[index]:
               append l1[index] to common_elements
       return common_elements
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    # Create an empty list to store common elements
    common_elements = []
    
    # Iterate through the indices of the lists
    for index in range(len(l1)):
        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists
        if l1[index] == l2[index] == l3[index]:
            # If they are the same, add the element to the common_elements list
            common_elements.append(l1[index])
    
    # Return the list of common elements
    return common_elements

    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

    In tackling the problem of determining if three adjacent sides of a cube are painted the same color, my initial approach was logically sound and correctly identified the necessary combinations of sides to check. However, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient implementation.

    **Key Insights from the Official Solution:**
    1. **Use of Indexing**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides directly. This approach simplifies the checking process by avoiding multiple conditional statements and instead iterating through predefined combinations.
  
    2. **Set for Uniqueness**: The official solution leverages the `set` data structure to check if all three colors are the same. By converting the list of colors to a set, it effectively checks for uniqueness in a single line, which is both elegant and efficient.

    3. **Control Flow**: The use of a counter (`c`) to track whether a match was found is straightforward, but the official solution could be further simplified by directly printing "YES" or "NO" based on the condition without needing an additional variable.

    **Comparison with My Approach**:
    - My solution explicitly checked each combination with multiple `or` conditions, which, while clear, could be seen as verbose compared to the official solution's use of a loop over a predefined list of combinations.
    - The official solution's use of `set` for checking color equality is a more Pythonic approach, reducing the complexity of the condition checks.

    ### Conclusion
    The official solution is more efficient in terms of readability and maintainability. It highlights the importance of leveraging built-in data structures and concise control flow in Python. In future problems, I will aim to adopt similar strategies to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective attendance frequencies. The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.

    The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.

    Key code snippets included:
    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            temp = b
            b = a % b
            a = temp
        return a

    def lcm(a, b):
        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

    def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):
        total_hours = N * 24
        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        return total_hours // lcm_value
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine if three adjacent sides of a cube were painted the same color based on given test cases. The solution involved checking specific combinations of adjacent sides for color matches. 

    The core concept tested was understanding the spatial relationships of a cube's sides and efficiently checking for color equality among them. The eight combinations of adjacent sides were identified and checked using simple conditional statements.

    The initial implementation was correct in logic but required clarity and adherence to the problem's constraints. The final solution efficiently processed each test case in constant time, leading to an overall complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases.

    Key code snippet for checking adjacent sides:
    ```python
    if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # front, left, top
        colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # front, right, top
        colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # front, left, bottom
        colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # front, right, bottom
        colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # back, left, top
        colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # back, right, top
        colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # back, left, bottom
        colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):    # back, right, bottom
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships in programming problems and the need for clear, efficient code.
