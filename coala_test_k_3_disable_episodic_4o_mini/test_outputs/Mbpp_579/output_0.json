    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find elements that are present in either of two given tuples but not in both. In other words, we need to identify the unique elements from both tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can convert both tuples into sets, which will allow us to easily find the unique elements. We can then use the symmetric difference operation on these sets to get the elements that are in one set or the other, but not in both. Finally, we will convert the result back into a tuple to match the required output format.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n       convert tuple1 to set1\n       convert tuple2 to set2\n       find symmetric difference between set1 and set2\n       convert the result back to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Convert the first tuple to a set\n    set1 = set(tuple1)\n    # Convert the second tuple to a set\n    set2 = set(tuple2)\n    # Find the symmetric difference between the two sets\n    dissimilar_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n    # Convert the result back to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(dissimilar_elements)\n```",
