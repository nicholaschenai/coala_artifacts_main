The core concept involved identifying the rightmost ascent in the permutation, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.\n\n    The implementation followed a clear structure: a helper function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution successfully handled multiple permutations as specified in the problem statement.\n\n    One key takeaway is the importance of understanding the mechanics of generating permutations, particularly the lexicographic order. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. The code was tested against sample inputs, and it produced the expected outputs, confirming its correctness. \n\n    Here\u2019s the essential code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def next_permutation(arr):\n        i = len(arr) - 2\n        while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        if i == -1:\n            arr.reverse()\n            return arr\n        j = len(arr) - 1\n        while arr[j] <= arr[i]:\n            j -= 1\n        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n        arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])\n        return arr\n\n    def main():\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(K):\n            permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)\n            results.append(\" \".join(map(str, next_perm)))\n        print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the solution's structure, which can be useful for similar tasks in the future.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next lexicographic permutation of a sequence. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This is a good practice for competitive programming as it simplifies the main logic and improves readability.\n\n    2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`. This is crucial because it identifies the point where the order can be changed to create the next permutation.\n\n    3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible permutation that is larger than the current one.\n\n    4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After swapping the pivot with the identified successor, the solution sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This step is efficient because it guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.\n\n    5. **Output**: The results are printed in a single line using unpacking, which is a concise way to format the output.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a clear understanding of the permutation generation process. My initial approach was similar but could have benefited from a more structured input handling and clearer separation of the steps involved in finding the next permutation. The official solution's use of sorting the suffix after the swap is a particularly effective way to ensure correctness without additional complexity.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Sorting\n    Section: Sorting theory\n    Part: 1/2\n    \\chapter{Sorting}\n\n    \\index{sorting}\n\n    \\key{Sorting}\n    is a fundamental algorithm design problem.\n    Many efficient algorithms\n    use sorting as a subroutine,\n    because it is often easier to process\n    data if the elements are in a sorted order.\n\n    For example, the problem ''does an array contain\n    two equal elements?'' is easy to solve using sorting.\n    If the array contains two equal elements,\n    they will be next to each other after sorting,\n    so it is easy to find them.\n    Also, the problem ''what is the most frequent element\n    in an array?'' can be solved similarly.\n\n    There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are\n    also good examples of how to apply\n    different algorithm design techniques.\n    The efficient general sorting algorithms\n    work in $O(n \\log n)$ time,\n    and many algorithms that use sorting\n    as a subroutine also\n    have this time complexity.\n\n    \\section{Sorting theory}\n\n    The basic problem in sorting is as follows:\n    \\begin{framed}\n    \\noindent\n    Given an array that contains $n$ elements,\n    your task is to sort the elements\n    in increasing order.\n    \\end{framed}\n    \\noindent\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    will be as follows after sorting:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\subsubsection{$O(n^2)$ algorithms}\n\n    \\index{bubble sort}\n\n    Simple algorithms for sorting an array\n    work in $O(n^2)$ time.\n    Such algorithms are short and usually\n    consist of two nested loops.\n    A famous $O(n^2)$ time sorting algorithm\n    is \\key{bubble sort} where the elements\n    ''bubble'' in the array according to their values.\n\n    Bubble sort consists of $n$ rounds.\n    On each round, the algorithm iterates through\n    the elements of the array.\n    Whenever two consecutive elements are found\n    that are not in correct order,\n    the algorithm swaps them.\n    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) {\n            if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {\n                swap(array[j],array[j+1]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    After the first round of the algorithm,\n    the largest element will be in the correct position,\n    and in general, after $k$ rounds, the $k$ largest\n    elements will be in the correct positions.\n    Thus, after $n$ rounds, the whole array\n    will be sorted.\n\n    For example, in the array\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\noindent\n    the first round of bubble sort swaps elements\n    as follows:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,<->] (3.5,-0.25) .. controls (3.25,-1.00) and (2.75,-1.00) ..
