    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to implement a sorting algorithm called Shell Sort, which sorts an array of integers in ascending order. The function should take an array as input and return a new array that is sorted.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: Shell Sort is an optimization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The algorithm works by comparing elements at a certain gap distance and gradually reducing the gap until it becomes 1, at which point the array is sorted using a standard insertion sort. The steps are:\n   - Start with a large gap and reduce it until it reaches 1.\n   - For each gap, perform a modified insertion sort on the elements that are that gap apart.\n   - Continue this process until the entire array is sorted.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function shell_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       gap = n // 2  // Start with a big gap, then reduce the gap\n       while gap > 0:\n           for i from gap to n-1:\n               temp = arr[i]\n               j = i\n               // Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found\n               while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                   arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                   j -= gap\n               arr[j] = temp\n           gap //= 2  // Reduce the gap for the next element\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef shell_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)  # Get the length of the array\n    gap = n // 2  # Start with a big gap, then reduce the gap\n    while gap > 0:  # Continue until the gap is 0\n        for i in range(gap, n):  # Start from the gap to the end of the array\n            temp = arr[i]  # Store the current element\n            j = i  # Initialize j to the current index\n            # Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found\n            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]  # Move the element at j-gap to position j\n                j -= gap  # Move j back by the gap\n            arr[j] = temp  # Place the current element in its correct position\n        gap //= 2  # Reduce the gap for the next element\n    return arr  # Return the sorted array\n```",
