    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that checks if there are any common elements between two sequences (lists). If there is at least one element that appears in both sequences, the function should return `True`. If there are no common elements, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through one of the sequences and check if any of its elements exist in the other sequence. If we find a match, we return `True`. If we finish checking all elements without finding a match, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n       for each element in seq1:\n           if element exists in seq2:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    # Iterate through each element in the first sequence\n    for element in seq1:\n        # Check if the current element exists in the second sequence\n        if element in seq2:\n            return True  # Return True if a common element is found\n    return False  # Return False if no common elements are found\n```",
