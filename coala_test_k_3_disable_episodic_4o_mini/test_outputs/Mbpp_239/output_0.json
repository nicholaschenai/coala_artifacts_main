    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many different sequences of a specified length (n) can be formed using positive integers. Each integer in the sequence must be at least double the previous integer and cannot exceed a given maximum value (m).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. Starting with the first integer, we can explore all possible integers that can follow it based on the constraints (being at least double the previous integer and not exceeding m). For each valid integer, we recursively find the number of valid sequences that can be formed with the remaining length (n-1). We will keep track of the current integer to ensure we only consider valid next integers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_sequences(current, length_remaining, max_value):\n       if length_remaining == 0:\n           return 1  // Found a valid sequence\n       total_count = 0\n       next_value = current * 2  // The next integer must be at least double the current\n       while next_value <= max_value:\n           total_count += count_sequences(next_value, length_remaining - 1, max_value)\n           next_value += 1  // Check the next possible integer\n       return total_count\n\n   function get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n       return count_sequences(1, n - 1, m)  // Start with the first integer as 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_sequences(current, length_remaining, max_value):\n    # Base case: if no length remaining, we found a valid sequence\n    if length_remaining == 0:\n        return 1  \n    total_count = 0\n    next_value = current * 2  # The next integer must be at least double the current\n    while next_value <= max_value:\n        total_count += count_sequences(next_value, length_remaining - 1, max_value)\n        next_value += 1  # Check the next possible integer\n    return total_count\n\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    return count_sequences(1, n - 1, m)  # Start with the first integer as 1\n```",
