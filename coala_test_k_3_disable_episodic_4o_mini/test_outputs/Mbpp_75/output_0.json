    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`, and returns a list of those tuples where every element in the tuple is divisible by `k`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each tuple in the provided list. For each tuple, we will check if all its elements are divisible by `k`. If they are, we will add that tuple to our result list. Finally, we will return the list of tuples that meet this condition.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_tuples(tuples_list, k):\n       create an empty result list\n       for each tuple in tuples_list:\n           set a flag to true\n           for each element in the tuple:\n               if element is not divisible by k:\n                   set the flag to false\n                   break\n           if flag is true:\n               add the tuple to the result list\n       return result list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_tuples(tuples_list, k):\n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the provided list\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        # Assume all elements are divisible by k\n        all_divisible = True\n        \n        # Check each element in the tuple\n        for element in tup:\n            # If any element is not divisible by k, set the flag to False\n            if element % k != 0:\n                all_divisible = False\n                break\n        \n        # If all elements are divisible, add the tuple to the result list\n        if all_divisible:\n            result.append(tup)\n    \n    # Return the list of tuples that have all elements divisible by k\n    return result\n```",
