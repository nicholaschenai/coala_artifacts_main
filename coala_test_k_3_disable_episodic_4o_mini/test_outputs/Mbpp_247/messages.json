The solution utilized a dynamic programming approach, which is a common strategy for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index, updating it based on previous elements.\n\n    The implemented algorithm iterated through the input array, comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length of the subsequence was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by taking the maximum value from the array that tracked the lengths.\n\n    The code snippet for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            d = [1] * len(nums)\n        \n            for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This approach runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem constraints. The solution was successful, passing all tests, indicating that the dynamic programming strategy was effective in this case. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of finding the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in an array of integers, I utilized a dynamic programming approach. The key concept was to maintain a list of dictionaries (`dp`), where each dictionary at index `i` tracks the lengths of subsequences for each possible difference between elements up to that index. \n\n    The algorithm iterates through each element in the array and, for each pair of elements, calculates the difference. It updates the length of the arithmetic subsequence in the corresponding dictionary and keeps track of the maximum length found. This approach effectively captures the relationships between elements and their differences, allowing for efficient updates and retrievals.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def longestArithSeqLength(self, A: list[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(A)\n            if n < 2:\n                return n\n        \n            dp = [{} for _ in range(n)]\n            max_length = 0\n        \n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    diff = A[i] - A[j]\n                    if diff not in dp[i]:\n                        dp[i][diff] = 0\n                    dp[i][diff] = max(dp[i][diff], dp[j].get(diff, 0) + 1)\n                    max_length = max(max_length, dp[i][diff] + 1)\n        \n            return max_length\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving problems involving subsequences and highlighted the utility of using dictionaries for efficient lookups and updates.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for the values along the shortest path from vertex 1 to each vertex k in a tree structure. The key concepts involved were tree traversal (using DFS) and dynamic programming for calculating the LIS efficiently.\n\n    Initially, the approach involved a straightforward DFS to find paths and then compute the LIS. However, the first implementation failed because it did not correctly limit the path to only include vertices from 1 to k, leading to incorrect LIS calculations. The output format was also incorrect, returning strings instead of integers.\n\n    The solution was refined by modifying the DFS function to stop at the target vertex k, ensuring that only relevant vertices were included in the path. The LIS calculation was implemented using a binary search approach to maintain efficiency, achieving O(n log n) complexity. This final implementation successfully passed all tests, demonstrating the importance of correctly managing path constraints and efficiently calculating the LIS.\n\n    Key Takeaways:\n    - Use DFS for tree traversal while ensuring paths are correctly limited to the target vertex.\n    - Implement LIS using dynamic programming with binary search for efficiency.\n    - Pay attention to output formats to match expected results. \n\n    Final working code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence):\n        # Implementation of LIS using binary search\n        ...\n\n    def dfs(current_vertex, parent, target, graph, path):\n        # Implementation of DFS to find path to target\n        ...\n\n    def main():\n        # Main function to read input, construct the graph, and compute LIS for each vertex\n        ...\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful problem analysis and the need for efficient algorithms in competitive programming contexts.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
