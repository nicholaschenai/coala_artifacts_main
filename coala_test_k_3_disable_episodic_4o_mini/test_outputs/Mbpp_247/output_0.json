    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find the length of the longest subsequence in a given string that reads the same forwards and backwards (a palindrome). For example, in the string \"TENS FOR TENS\", the longest palindromic subsequence is \"TENS\", which has a length of 5.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array where each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring from index `i` to index `j`. We will fill this table by checking characters from both ends of the substring and building up the solution based on smaller substrings.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function lps(s):\n       n = length of s\n       create a 2D array dp of size n x n initialized to 0\n\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           dp[i][i] = 1  // single character is a palindrome\n\n       for length from 2 to n:\n           for start from 0 to n-length:\n               end = start + length - 1\n               if s[start] == s[end]:\n                   dp[start][end] = dp[start + 1][end - 1] + 2\n               else:\n                   dp[start][end] = max(dp[start + 1][end], dp[start][end - 1])\n\n       return dp[0][n-1]  // length of longest palindromic subsequence\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef lps(s: str) -> int:\n    n = len(s)\n    # Create a 2D array to store lengths of longest palindromic subsequences\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n    # Every single character is a palindrome of length 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = 1\n\n    # Build the dp array\n    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring\n        for start in range(n - length + 1):\n            end = start + length - 1\n            if s[start] == s[end]:  # characters match\n                dp[start][end] = dp[start + 1][end - 1] + 2\n            else:  # characters do not match\n                dp[start][end] = max(dp[start + 1][end], dp[start][end - 1])\n\n    # The result is in the top right corner of the dp array\n    return dp[0][n - 1]\n```",
