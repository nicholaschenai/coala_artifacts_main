An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. The efficient approach to solve this problem is to use a modified merge sort algorithm, which allows counting inversions while sorting the array.\n\n    The core concept involved using a divide-and-conquer strategy. The array is recursively divided into two halves, and inversions are counted in each half as well as those that cross the halves during the merge process. This method is efficient with a time complexity of O(N log N), making it suitable for the input constraints.\n\n    The implementation involved defining helper functions for merging and counting inversions, and a main function to handle input and output. The solution was successfully tested with the provided sample input, yielding the correct output. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the approach proved effective for the problem at hand. \n\n    Key code snippets include the `merge_and_count` function, which counts inversions during the merge step, and the `merge_sort_and_count` function, which orchestrates the recursive sorting and counting process. The final solution is structured to read from standard input and output the results for each test case.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively implements a modified merge sort algorithm to count inversions in an array. The key insights from this solution include:\n\n    1. **Recursive Division**: The algorithm divides the array into two halves recursively until it reaches subarrays of size one. This is a standard approach in divide-and-conquer algorithms, allowing for efficient processing of the data.\n\n    2. **Counting Inversions During Merge**: The critical part of the solution is in the `merge` function, where it counts inversions while merging two sorted subarrays. When an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, it indicates that all remaining elements in the left subarray (from the current index to the end) are greater than the current element from the right subarray. This is where the inversion count is updated.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**: The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(N log N), which is efficient for the input constraints (up to 100,000 elements). This is significantly better than a naive O(N^2) approach that would involve checking every possible pair.\n\n    4. **Use of Temporary Array**: The solution uses a temporary array to facilitate the merging process, ensuring that the original array is updated correctly after counting inversions.\n\n    5. **Input Handling**: The solution reads multiple test cases in a straightforward manner, processing each case independently and printing the results.\n\n    In my own attempt, the structure was similar, but I could have emphasized the counting of inversions more clearly during the merge step. The official solution's clarity in separating the counting logic from the merging logic is a good practice that enhances readability and maintainability. Overall, the official solution serves as a solid reference for implementing inversion counting using merge sort.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Reference Code (Not callable)]:\n\n    [description for function: solve]\n    This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer array. It initializes a temporary array for sorting and counts the number of inversions in the array using a merge sort algorithm. For each test case, it processes the array and appends the inversion count to a results list. Finally, it prints the inversion counts for all test cases. The function effectively combines input handling, sorting, and output in a structured manner. It ensures that the inversion counts are calculated efficiently for potentially large datasets.\n\n    [end of description]\n    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze the order of elements in an array, particularly in sorting algorithms and data analysis. It can be applied in competitive programming, algorithm design, and optimization problems where understanding the number of inversions can help in determining the efficiency of sorting methods or in assessing the degree of disorder in a dataset. Additionally, it can be relevant in fields like computer science, statistics, and data science where inversion counts can indicate relationships between data points.\n\n\n    def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n        i = left    # Starting index for left subarray\n        j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray\n        k = left    # Starting index to be sorted\n        inv_count = 0\n\n        # Conditions are checked to ensure that i doesn't exceed mid and j doesn't exceed right\n        while i <= mid and j <= right:\n            if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n                temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n                inv_count += (mid - i + 1)  # Count inversions\n                j += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        # Copy the remaining elements of left subarray, if any\n        while i <= mid:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n            i += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        # Copy the remaining elements of right subarray, if any\n        while j <= right:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n            j += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        # Copy the sorted subarray into Original array\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n        return inv_count\n\n    def merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n        inv_count = 0\n        if left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n            inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n            inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n        return inv_count\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])  # Read size of array\n            index += 1\n            arr = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the array\n            index += 1\n        \n            temp_arr = [0] * N  # Temporary array for merge sort\n            result = merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, N - 1)  # Count inversions\n            results.append(result)  # Store result for this test case\n    \n        # Print all results for each test case\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n\n[/Reference Code (Not callable)]\n\n"
