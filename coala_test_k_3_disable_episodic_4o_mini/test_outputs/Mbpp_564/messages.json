The solution will correctly account for the frequency of each integer in the list to calculate the number of valid pairs.\n\nHere is the final Python code:\n\n```python\ndef count_Pairs(int_list, n):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each integer\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count occurrences of each integer in the list\n    for num in int_list:\n        if num in count_dict:\n            count_dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[num] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for the number of unique pairs\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Convert the dictionary keys to a list of unique integers\n    unique_list = list(count_dict.keys())\n    \n    # Iterate through the unique list to count pairs\n    for i in range(len(unique_list)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(unique_list)):\n            # Calculate the number of pairs formed by unique_list[i] and unique_list[j]\n            count += count_dict[unique_list[i]] * count_dict[unique_list[j]]\n    \n    return count  # Return the total count of unique pairs\n``` \n\nThis code correctly counts the number of unordered pairs of unequal integers by considering the frequency of each integer in the input list."
