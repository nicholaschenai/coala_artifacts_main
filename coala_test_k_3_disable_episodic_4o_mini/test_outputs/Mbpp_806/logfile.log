INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/806 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence of uppercase letters found in that string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string while keeping track of the current count of consecutive uppercase letters. If we encounter an uppercase letter, we increment our current count. If we encounter a lowercase letter or a non-letter character, we compare the current count with the maximum count found so far and reset the current count to zero. At the end of the iteration, we need to check one last time to ensure we account for any uppercase sequence that might end at the last character of the string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_run_uppercase(s):
       initialize max_count to 0
       initialize current_count to 0
       
       for each character in s:
           if character is uppercase:
               increment current_count
           else:
               if current_count > max_count:
                   update max_count
               reset current_count to 0
       
       if current_count > max_count:
           update max_count
       
       return max_count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_run_uppercase(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize the maximum count of uppercase letters found
    max_count = 0
    # Initialize the current count of consecutive uppercase letters
    current_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is uppercase
        if char.isupper():
            # Increment the current count
            current_count += 1
        else:
            # If we encounter a lowercase letter, check if the current count is greater than max_count
            if current_count > max_count:
                max_count = current_count

    # Final check to update max_count in case the string ends with uppercase letters
    if current_count > max_count:

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In attempting to solve the problem of finding the shortest superstring that contains all given strings as substrings, I initially focused on generating permutations of the input strings and merging them based on maximum overlaps. However, the approach failed to account for the order of merging, which is crucial for achieving the shortest result. 

    The core concept tested in this problem is the ability to efficiently merge strings while maximizing overlaps, which can significantly reduce the length of the resulting superstring. The strategy of using permutations was sound, but the merging logic needed to be more comprehensive to explore all possible combinations effectively.

    One key error was not considering that different orders of merging could yield different results. For example, merging "loves" and "alex" first could lead to a shorter superstring than merging "alex" and "loves" first. This oversight led to incorrect outputs in tests.

    In future attempts, a more robust backtracking approach that explores all combinations of merging strings while keeping track of overlaps would be beneficial. Additionally, ensuring that the merging logic is flexible enough to handle various arrangements will be crucial for solving similar problems effectively.

    Hereâ€™s a concise version of the merging logic that was used:

    ```python
    def max_overlap(s1, s2):
        max_len = 0
        for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):
            if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:
                max_len = i
        return max_len

    def merge(s1, s2):
        overlap = max_overlap(s1, s2)
        return s1 + s2[overlap:]
    ```

    This logic is essential for merging strings based on their overlaps, but it needs to be integrated into a more comprehensive solution that considers all possible orders of merging.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The problem involved removing adjacent duplicate characters from a string based on a specified count `k`. The solution utilized a stack to efficiently manage character counts and removals. The core concept was to iterate through the string, pushing characters onto the stack while tracking their counts. When a character's count reached `k`, it was removed from the stack.

    The strategy of using a stack worked effectively, as it allowed for easy access to the last character and its count, facilitating quick updates and removals. The final string was constructed by joining the characters left in the stack, multiplied by their respective counts.

    The implemented solution was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without issues. The key takeaway is the utility of stacks in problems involving consecutive elements and counts, which can simplify the logic and improve efficiency. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
            stack = []
            for char in s:
                if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                    stack[-1][1] += 1
                    if stack[-1][1] == k:
                        stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append([char, 1])
            result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)
            return result
    ```
