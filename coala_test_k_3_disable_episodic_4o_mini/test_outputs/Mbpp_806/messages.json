The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.\n\n    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of \"abacaba\". The logic needed to ensure that after placing \"abacaba\", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. Checking how many times \"abacaba\" already appeared in the string.\n    2. Attempting to place \"abacaba\" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.\n    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.\n    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.\n\n    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            n = case[0]\n            s = case[1]\n            modified_string = list(s)\n\n            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            placed = False\n            for i in range(n - 6):\n                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):\n                    temp_string = modified_string[:]\n                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)\n                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:\n                        modified_string = temp_string\n                        placed = True\n                        break\n\n            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            if final_count != 1:\n                print(\"No\")\n            else:\n                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)\n                print(\"Yes\")\n                print(\"\".join(modified_string))\n\n    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != \"abacaba\"[j]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            s[index + j] = \"abacaba\"[j]\n\n    def count_abacaba(s):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n            if \"\".join(s[i:i + 7]) == \"abacaba\":\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\n    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i] == '?':\n                s[i] = 'z'\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(input())\n        s = input().strip()\n        test_cases.append((n, s))\n\n    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In attempting to solve the problem of finding the shortest superstring that contains all given strings as substrings, I initially focused on generating permutations of the input strings and merging them based on maximum overlaps. However, the approach failed to account for the order of merging, which is crucial for achieving the shortest result. \n\n    The core concept tested in this problem is the ability to efficiently merge strings while maximizing overlaps, which can significantly reduce the length of the resulting superstring. The strategy of using permutations was sound, but the merging logic needed to be more comprehensive to explore all possible combinations effectively.\n\n    One key error was not considering that different orders of merging could yield different results. For example, merging \"loves\" and \"alex\" first could lead to a shorter superstring than merging \"alex\" and \"loves\" first. This oversight led to incorrect outputs in tests.\n\n    In future attempts, a more robust backtracking approach that explores all combinations of merging strings while keeping track of overlaps would be beneficial. Additionally, ensuring that the merging logic is flexible enough to handle various arrangements will be crucial for solving similar problems effectively.\n\n    Here\u2019s a concise version of the merging logic that was used:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_overlap(s1, s2):\n        max_len = 0\n        for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n            if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n                max_len = i\n        return max_len\n\n    def merge(s1, s2):\n        overlap = max_overlap(s1, s2)\n        return s1 + s2[overlap:]\n    ```\n\n    This logic is essential for merging strings based on their overlaps, but it needs to be integrated into a more comprehensive solution that considers all possible orders of merging.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved removing adjacent duplicate characters from a string based on a specified count `k`. The solution utilized a stack to efficiently manage character counts and removals. The core concept was to iterate through the string, pushing characters onto the stack while tracking their counts. When a character's count reached `k`, it was removed from the stack.\n\n    The strategy of using a stack worked effectively, as it allowed for easy access to the last character and its count, facilitating quick updates and removals. The final string was constructed by joining the characters left in the stack, multiplied by their respective counts.\n\n    The implemented solution was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without issues. The key takeaway is the utility of stacks in problems involving consecutive elements and counts, which can simplify the logic and improve efficiency. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n            stack = []\n            for char in s:\n                if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                    stack[-1][1] += 1\n                    if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                        stack.pop()\n                else:\n                    stack.append([char, 1])\n            result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)\n            return result\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
