    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find the nth centered hexagonal number. Centered hexagonal numbers are a specific sequence of numbers that can be visualized as a hexagon with a center point, where each layer around the center adds more points in a hexagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The nth centered hexagonal number can be calculated using a formula. The formula for the nth centered hexagonal number is given by:\n   \\[\n   H(n) = 3n(n - 1) + 1\n   \\]\n   This formula derives from the geometric arrangement of points in a hexagonal shape. We will implement a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the nth centered hexagonal number using this formula.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION centered_hexagonal_number(n):\n       IF n is less than 1:\n           RETURN 0\n       ELSE:\n           RETURN 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n):\n    # Check if n is less than 1, return 0 as a base case\n    if n < 1:\n        return 0\n    # Calculate the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula\n    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1  # H(n) = 3n(n - 1) + 1\n```",
