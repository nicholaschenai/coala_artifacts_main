The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, specifically after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements. The key insight was recognizing that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to the Pisano period. This allowed for efficient computation even for very large values of N (up to 10^18).\n\n    The solution was structured into three main functions: one to compute the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using the Pisano period, another to determine the last remaining number after the removal process, and a final function to handle input and output. The approach of reducing N by half in each iteration of the removal process was effective, as it directly correlated with the position in the last digits array.\n\n    The final implementation passed the provided test cases successfully, demonstrating that the strategy of leveraging the periodicity of Fibonacci last digits was both efficient and effective. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The solution is useful for similar problems involving sequences and periodicity. \n\n    Key code snippets:\n    ```python\n    def last_digit_fibonacci(n):\n        # Calculate the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using Pisano period\n        ...\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(n):\n        # Find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements\n        ...\n\n    def solve():\n        # Handle input and output\n        ...\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, including only every Kth Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.\n\n    The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. \n\n    The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def fibonacci(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\n    def S(N, K):\n        sum_fib = 0\n        for i in range(0, N + 1):\n            if i % K == 0:\n                sum_fib += fibonacci(i)\n        return sum_fib\n    ``` \n\n    Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
