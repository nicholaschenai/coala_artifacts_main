    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes two strings as input. The first string contains a series of characters, and the second string contains characters that should be removed from the first string. The function should return a new string that consists of the characters from the first string, excluding any characters that are present in the second string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the first string and check if it is present in the second string. If it is not present, we will add it to a new result string. At the end of the iteration, we will return the result string which contains only the characters that were not removed.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_dirty_chars(str1, str2):\n       create an empty result string\n       for each character in str1:\n           if character is not in str2:\n               append character to result string\n       return result string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(str1: str, str2: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty result string to store the filtered characters\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the first string\n    for char in str1:\n        # Check if the character is not in the second string\n        if char not in str2:\n            # If not, append it to the result string\n            result += char\n            \n    # Return the final result string\n    return result\n```",
