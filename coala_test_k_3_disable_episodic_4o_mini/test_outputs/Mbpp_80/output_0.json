    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the nth tetrahedral number. Tetrahedral numbers represent a three-dimensional equivalent of triangular numbers and can be visualized as a pyramid with a triangular base. The nth tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the nth tetrahedral number, we can use the formula for the nth tetrahedral number, which is given by the sum of the first n triangular numbers. The nth triangular number can be calculated using the formula \\( T(n) = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). Therefore, the nth tetrahedral number can be computed by summing these triangular numbers from 1 to n.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function tetrahedral_number(n):\n       total = 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           triangular_number = (i * (i + 1)) / 2\n           total += triangular_number\n       return total\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef tetrahedral_number(n):\n    # Initialize total to accumulate the tetrahedral number\n    total = 0\n    # Loop through each number from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the ith triangular number\n        triangular_number = (i * (i + 1)) // 2\n        # Add the triangular number to the total\n        total += triangular_number\n    # Return the final tetrahedral number\n    return total\n```",
