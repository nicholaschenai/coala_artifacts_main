If the string has at least one 'z', the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string and check if any character is 'z'. If we find 'z', we return `True`. If we finish checking all characters without finding 'z', we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION text_match_wordz(word):\n       FOR each character in word:\n           IF character is 'z':\n               RETURN True\n       RETURN False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef text_match_wordz(word):\n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in word:\n        # Check if the character is 'z'\n        if char == 'z':\n            return True  # Return True if 'z' is found\n    return False  # Return False if 'z' is not found\n```",
