    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that finds the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to a given integer `n`. For example, if `n` is 0, the smallest power of 2 that meets this condition is 1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`, we can start from 1 (which is 2^0) and keep multiplying by 2 until we reach or exceed `n`. This approach is straightforward and ensures that we find the correct power of 2.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function next_power_of_2(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 1\n       power = 1\n       while power < n:\n           power = power * 2\n       return power\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef next_power_of_2(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is 0, the smallest power of 2 is 1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Start with the smallest power of 2 (which is 1)\n    power = 1\n    \n    # Keep multiplying by 2 until we reach or exceed n\n    while power < n:\n        power *= 2\n    \n    # Return the smallest power of 2 that is >= n\n    return power\n```",
