The key insight is the use of the `min` function to keep track of the lexicographically smallest string encountered during the iterations. This approach is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in string comparison capabilities.\n\n    One notable aspect of the official solution is its simplicity and clarity. It maintains a single variable `answer` initialized to the original string, which is updated whenever a smaller string is found. This avoids the need for an additional list to store results, making the code more concise.\n\n    In terms of performance, both the official solution and my approach have similar time complexity, as they both involve nested loops iterating through the string. However, the official solution is slightly more efficient in terms of space since it does not require an extra list to store intermediate results.\n\n    Overall, the official solution reinforces the importance of leveraging built-in functions for comparisons and maintaining clarity in variable usage. It serves as a reminder to focus on simplicity and efficiency in problem-solving.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Greedy algorithms\n    Section: Minimizing sums\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Minimizing sums}\n\n    We next consider a problem where\n    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$\n    and our task is to find a value $x$\n    that minimizes the sum\n    \\[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\\]\n    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Case $c=1$}\n\n    In this case, we should minimize the sum\n    \\[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\\cdots+|a_n-x|.\\]\n    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,\n    the best solution is to select $x=2$\n    which produces the sum\n    \\[\n    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.\n    \\]\n    In the general case, the best choice for $x$\n    is the \\textit{median} of the numbers,\n    i.e., the middle number after sorting.\n    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$\n    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,\n    so the median is 2.\n\n    The median is an optimal choice,\n    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,\n    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,\n    and if $x$ is larger then the median,\n    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.\n    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$\n    is the median.\n    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,\n    both medians and all values between them\n    are optimal choices.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Case $c=2$}\n\n    In this case, we should minimize the sum\n    \\[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\\]\n    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,\n    the best solution is to select $x=4$\n    which produces the sum\n    \\[\n    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.\n    \\]\n    In the general case, the best choice for $x$\n    is the \\emph{average} of the numbers.\n    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.\n    This result can be derived by presenting\n    the sum as follows:\n    \\[\n    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\\cdots+a_n^2)\n    \\]\n    The last part does not depend on $x$,\n    so we can ignore it.\n    The remaining parts form a function\n    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n$.\n    This is a parabola opening upwards\n    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,\n    and the minimum value is the average\n    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,\n    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective attendance frequencies. The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.\n\n    The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.\n\n    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.\n\n    Key code snippets included:\n    ```python\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            temp = b\n            b = a % b\n            a = temp\n        return a\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\n    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):\n        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)\n\n    def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):\n        total_hours = N * 24\n        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        return total_hours // lcm_value\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
