    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest of those three numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare the first number with the second and third numbers. We can use a simple comparison approach where we check which number is smaller and return that as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_of_three(a, b, c):\n       if a is less than b and a is less than c:\n           return a\n       else if b is less than a and b is less than c:\n           return b\n       else:\n           return c\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to find the minimum of three numbers\ndef min_of_three(a, b, c):\n    # Check if 'a' is less than both 'b' and 'c'\n    if a < b and a < c:\n        return a  # 'a' is the minimum\n    # Check if 'b' is less than both 'a' and 'c'\n    elif b < a and b < c:\n        return b  # 'b' is the minimum\n    # If neither 'a' nor 'b' is the minimum, then 'c' must be the minimum\n    else:\n        return c  # 'c' is the minimum\n```",
