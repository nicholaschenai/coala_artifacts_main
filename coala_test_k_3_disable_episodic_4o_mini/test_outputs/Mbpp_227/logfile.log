INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/227 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest of those three numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare the first number with the second and third numbers. We will keep track of the smallest number found during these comparisons and return it at the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function min_of_three(a, b, c):
       Initialize min_value to a
       If b is less than min_value:
           Set min_value to b
       If c is less than min_value:
           Set min_value to c
       Return min_value
   ```

```python
# Define a function to find the minimum of three numbers
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    # Initialize min_value to the first number
    min_value = a
    # Compare with the second number
    if b < min_value:

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by iterating through each character in the string and considering all possible positions for reinserting that character. The key insight is the use of the `min` function to keep track of the lexicographically smallest string encountered during the iterations. This approach is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in string comparison capabilities.

    One notable aspect of the official solution is its simplicity and clarity. It maintains a single variable `answer` initialized to the original string, which is updated whenever a smaller string is found. This avoids the need for an additional list to store results, making the code more concise.

    In terms of performance, both the official solution and my approach have similar time complexity, as they both involve nested loops iterating through the string. However, the official solution is slightly more efficient in terms of space since it does not require an extra list to store intermediate results.

    Overall, the official solution reinforces the importance of leveraging built-in functions for comparisons and maintaining clarity in variable usage. It serves as a reminder to focus on simplicity and efficiency in problem-solving.

    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Minimizing sums
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective attendance frequencies. The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.

    The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.

    Key code snippets included:
    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            temp = b
            b = a % b
            a = temp
        return a

    def lcm(a, b):
        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

    def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):
        total_hours = N * 24
        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        return total_hours // lcm_value
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.
