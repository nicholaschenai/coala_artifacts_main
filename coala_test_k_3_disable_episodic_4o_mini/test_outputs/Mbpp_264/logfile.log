INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/264 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that converts a dog's age in human years to its equivalent age in dog years. The function should take an integer input representing the dog's age in human years and return an integer representing the dog's age in dog years.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert human years to dog years, we can use a common formula where the first two years of a dog's life are equivalent to 10.5 human years each, and every year after that is equivalent to 4 human years. Therefore, if the dog's age is 2 years or less, we multiply the age by 10.5. If the age is greater than 2, we calculate the first two years as 21 (2 * 10.5) and then add 4 for each additional year.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function dog_age(human_years):
       if human_years <= 2:
           return human_years * 10.5
       else:
           return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate dog's age in dog's years
def dog_age(human_years: int) -> int:
    # If the dog's age is 2 years or less
    if human_years <= 2:
        # Calculate dog's age as 10.5 years for each human year
        return int(human_years * 10.5)
    else:
        # Calculate the age for the first two years
        # and add 4 for each additional year
        return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4

[Summary]:
    The problem involved calculating the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The solution required understanding arithmetic series and efficiently calculating the sum without iterating through all multiples, which is crucial given the constraints (N can be as large as 1 billion).

    The approach used was to determine the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, then calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10 up to that point. The sum was computed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. This method is efficient and avoids potential performance issues with large inputs.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway is the importance of leveraging mathematical formulas for series to optimize calculations, especially when dealing with large ranges. 

    Here’s the core function used:

    ```python
    def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
        largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
        number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10
        sum_multiples = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2
        return sum_multiples
    ```

    This function efficiently computes the desired sum, demonstrating the effectiveness of using arithmetic properties in programming challenges.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to create a function that converts a number to a specified base, including handling both integer and fractional parts. The function needed to support bases from 2 to 36 and format the output correctly as a string.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Base Conversion**: The core concept involved repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders to form the digits in the new base.
    - **Handling Decimals**: For fractional parts, the approach involved multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting the integer part as the next digit.

    ### Issues Encountered:
    1. **Integer Conversion Logic**: The initial implementation failed to correctly convert integers to the specified base, leading to incorrect outputs for several test cases. The remainders were not being calculated or collected properly.
    2. **Fractional Part Handling**: The logic for converting the fractional part was also flawed, resulting in incorrect decimal outputs.
    3. **Output Formatting**: The formatting for zero and decimal places was incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

    ### Strategies That Worked:
    - The use of lists to collect digits and then reversing them for the final output was a good approach, but it needed to be applied correctly.
    - Ensuring that the function could handle negative numbers and zero was crucial for comprehensive functionality.

    ### Code Snippet:
    Here’s the final version of the function that was intended to address the issues:

    ```python
    def converter(n, decimals=0, base=3.141592653589793):
        if n == 0:
            return "0" + (".0" * decimals if decimals > 0 else "")
    
        if n < 0:
            sign = "-"
            n = -n
        else:
            sign = ""
    
        integer_part = int(n)
        fractional_part = n - integer_part
    
        digits = []
        while integer_part > 0:
            remainder = int(integer_part % base)
            if remainder >= 10:
                digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('A')))
            else:
                digits.append(str(remainder))
            integer_part = int(integer_part // base)
    
        integer_result = ''.join(reversed(digits)) if digits else "0"
    
        if decimals > 0:
            fractional_digits = []
            while decimals > 0:
                fractional_part *= base
                fractional_digit = int(fractional_part)
                if fractional_digit >= 10:
                    fractional_digits.append(chr(fractional_digit - 10 + ord('A')))
                else:
                    fractional_digits.append(str(fractional_digit))
                fractional_part -= fractional_digit
                decimals -= 1
        
            fractional_result = ''.join(fractional_digits)
            return sign + integer_result + "." + fractional_result
    
        return sign + integer_result
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    The experience highlighted the importance of carefully implementing base conversion logic and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts are handled correctly. Future attempts should focus on validating the conversion process with a wider range of test cases to ensure robustness.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/264 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that converts a dog's age in human years to its equivalent age in dog years. The conversion rule is that the first two years of a dog's life count as 10.5 human years each, and every year after that counts as 4 human years.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To calculate a dog's age in dog years, we need to check how many years the dog has lived. If the dog is 2 years old or younger, we multiply its age by 10.5. If the dog is older than 2 years, we calculate the first two years as 21 (2 * 10.5) and then add 4 for each additional year.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function dog_age(human_years):
       if human_years <= 2:

       else:
           first_two_years = 21
