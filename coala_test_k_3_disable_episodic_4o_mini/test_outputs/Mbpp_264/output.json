    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that converts a dog's age in human years to its equivalent age in dog years. The conversion rule is that the first two years of a dog's life count as 10.5 human years each, and every year after that counts as 4 human years.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To calculate a dog's age in dog years, we need to check how many years the dog has lived. If the dog is 2 years old or younger, we multiply its age by 10.5. If the dog is older than 2 years, we calculate the first two years as 21 (2 * 10.5) and then add 4 for each additional year.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function dog_age(human_years):\n       if human_years <= 2:\n           return human_years * 10.5\n       else:\n           first_two_years = 21\n           additional_years = (human_years - 2) * 4\n           return first_two_years + additional_years\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef dog_age(human_years):\n    # Check if the dog's age is 2 years or less\n    if human_years <= 2:\n        # Calculate dog years for ages 2 and under\n        return human_years * 10.5\n    else:\n        # Calculate dog years for ages over 2\n        first_two_years = 21  # 2 years * 10.5\n        additional_years = (human_years - 2) * 4  # Each year after counts as 4\n        return first_two_years + additional_years  # Total dog years\n\n```",
