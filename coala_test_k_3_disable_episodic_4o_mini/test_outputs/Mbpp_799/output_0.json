    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a 32-bit integer and rotates its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. For example, if we take the number 16 (which is `00000000 00000000 00000000 00010000` in binary) and rotate it left by 2 bits, the result should be 64 (which is `00000000 00000000 00000001 00000000` in binary).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To rotate the bits of a number to the left, we can use bitwise operations. We need to:\n   - Shift the number to the left by `d` positions.\n   - If the leftmost bits that are shifted out exceed 32 bits, we need to wrap them around to the right side of the number.\n   - Finally, we ensure that the result remains within the bounds of a 32-bit integer.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function left_rotate(n, d):\n       # Ensure d is within the range of 0 to 31\n       d = d % 32\n       # Shift n left by d bits\n       left_shifted = n << d\n       # Shift n right by (32 - d) bits to get the bits that overflow\n       right_shifted = n >> (32 - d)\n       # Combine both results using bitwise OR\n       result = left_shifted | right_shifted\n       # Return the result masked to 32 bits\n       return result & 0xFFFFFFFF\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef left_rotate(n: int, d: int) -> int:\n    # Ensure d is within the range of 0 to 31\n    d = d % 32\n    # Shift n left by d bits\n    left_shifted = n << d\n    # Shift n right by (32 - d) bits to get the bits that overflow\n    right_shifted = n >> (32 - d)\n    # Combine both results using bitwise OR\n    result = left_shifted | right_shifted\n    # Return the result masked to 32 bits\n    return result & 0xFFFFFFFF\n```",
