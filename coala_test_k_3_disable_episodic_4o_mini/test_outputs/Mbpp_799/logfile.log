INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/799 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a number and rotates its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. The number is treated as a 32-bit integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To rotate the bits of a number to the left, we can shift the bits to the left by the specified number of positions. If the bits that are shifted out of the left end exceed the 32-bit limit, they should wrap around to the right end of the number. We can achieve this by using bitwise operations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `left_rotate(num, d)`.
   - Calculate the effective number of rotations needed by taking `d % 32` (since rotating by 32 or more would return the number to its original state).
   - Shift the number `num` to the left by `d` positions.
   - Shift the number `num` to the right by `(32 - d)` positions to get the bits that overflowed.
   - Combine the two results using a bitwise OR operation.
   - Return the result, ensuring it fits within 32 bits by applying a mask of `0xFFFFFFFF`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def left_rotate(num: int, d: int) -> int:
    # Calculate effective rotations
    d = d % 32
    
    # Shift left and wrap around the bits that overflow
    left_shifted = (num << d) & 0xFFFFFFFF  # Shift left and mask to 32 bits
    right_shifted = (num >> (32 - d)) & 0xFFFFFFFF  # Shift right to get overflow bits
    
    # Combine the two results
    result = left_shifted | right_shifted
    
    return result
```

[Summary]:
    The problem involved transforming an integer `n` into zero using the minimum number of operations, specifically by manipulating its binary representation. The key operations allowed were flipping the rightmost bit and flipping a specific bit based on the state of adjacent bits.

    The solution utilized a loop to repeatedly find and flip the rightmost 1 bit in the binary representation of `n`. Each operation was counted until `n` reached zero. The approach was straightforward, leveraging bitwise operations to efficiently determine the bits to manipulate.

    One important aspect was ensuring that the second operation was only performed if there were still bits left to flip. The solution passed the provided test cases, including edge cases like `n = 0`, which required no operations. Overall, the experience reinforced the utility of bitwise operations in solving problems related to binary representations and operations on integers. 

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
            if n == 0:
                return 0
        
            count = 0
        
            while n > 0:
                count += 1
                rightmost_one = n & -n
                n ^= rightmost_one
            
                if n > 0:
                    next_bit = rightmost_one << 1
                    n ^= next_bit
        
            return count
    ``` 

    This solution effectively captures the necessary logic to minimize operations while transforming `n` to zero.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides a more efficient approach to solving the problem of transforming an integer `n` to zero using the minimum number of operations. The key insights from the official solution are as follows:

    1. **Counting Bits**: The solution first counts the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of `n`. This is done using a while loop that checks the least significant bit (`m & 1`) and right shifts `m` until it becomes zero. This count (`s`) is crucial as it determines how many operations will be needed.

    2. **Bit Manipulation**: The second part of the solution involves manipulating the bits of `n` based on the count of 1 bits. It uses a variable `k` to represent the current bit position being processed. The loop continues until all bits have been processed. The operations are performed by checking if the current bit in `n` is set and flipping it accordingly.

    3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient because it directly manipulates the bits without unnecessary recursive calls or additional checks. It leverages bitwise operations, which are generally faster and more efficient than arithmetic operations.

    In contrast, my initial approach involved a more complex recursive strategy that may not have effectively minimized the number of operations. The reliance on flipping bits based on conditions could lead to unnecessary operations, especially if the logic for determining which bits to flip was not optimal.

    Overall, the official solution's method of counting bits and then systematically flipping them based on their positions is a clearer and more efficient way to tackle the problem. This experience highlights the importance of understanding bit manipulation techniques in solving problems related to binary representations.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/799 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a 32-bit integer and rotates its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. For example, if we take the number 16 (which is `00000000 00000000 00000000 00010000` in binary) and rotate it left by 2 bits, the result should be 64 (which is `00000000 00000000 00000001 00000000` in binary).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To rotate the bits of a number to the left, we can use bitwise operations. We need to:
   - Shift the number to the left by `d` positions.
   - If the leftmost bits that are shifted out exceed 32 bits, we need to wrap them around to the right side of the number.
   - Finally, we ensure that the result remains within the bounds of a 32-bit integer.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function left_rotate(n, d):
       # Ensure d is within the range of 0 to 31
       d = d % 32
       # Shift n left by d bits
