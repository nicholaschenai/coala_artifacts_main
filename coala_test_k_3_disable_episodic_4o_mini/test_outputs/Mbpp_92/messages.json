        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given number is \"undulating.\" An undulating number is defined as one where the digits alternate between two different values. For example, the number 1212121 is undulating because it alternates between 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if a number is undulating, we can convert the number to a string to easily access each digit. We will then check if the digits alternate between two distinct values. If we find that the digits do not alternate correctly, we will return False. If they do alternate correctly throughout the entire number, we will return True.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Convert the number to a string.\n   - Check if the length of the string is less than 2; if so, return True (since a single digit or empty number is trivially undulating).\n   - Initialize two variables to hold the first and second distinct digits.\n   - Loop through the digits of the string:\n     - If the current index is even, check if it matches the first digit.\n     - If the current index is odd, check if it matches the second digit.\n     - If a mismatch is found, return False.\n   - If the loop completes without mismatches, return True.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef is_undulating(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string to access each digit\n    num_str = str(number)\n    \n    # If the number has less than 2 digits, it is undulating\n    if len(num_str) < 2:\n        return True\n    \n    # Initialize the first and second distinct digits\n    first_digit = num_str[0]\n    second_digit = None\n    \n    # Find the second distinct digit\n    for digit in num_str:\n        if digit != first_digit:\n            second_digit = digit\n            break\n    \n    # If there is no second distinct digit, return False\n    if second_digit is None:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check the undulating pattern\n    for i in range(len(num_str)):\n        if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index\n            if num_str[i] != first_digit:\n                return False\n        else:  # Odd index\n            if num_str[i] != second_digit:\n                return False\n    \n    # If all checks passed, return True\n    return True\n```"

The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, specifically after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements. The key insight was recognizing that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to the Pisano period. This allowed for efficient computation even for very large values of N (up to 10^18).\n\n    The solution was structured into three main functions: one to compute the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using the Pisano period, another to determine the last remaining number after the removal process, and a final function to handle input and output. The approach of reducing N by half in each iteration of the removal process was effective, as it directly correlated with the position in the last digits array.\n\n    The final implementation passed the provided test cases successfully, demonstrating that the strategy of leveraging the periodicity of Fibonacci last digits was both efficient and effective. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The solution is useful for similar problems involving sequences and periodicity. \n\n    Key code snippets:\n    ```python\n    def last_digit_fibonacci(n):\n        # Calculate the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using Pisano period\n        ...\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(n):\n        # Find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements\n        ...\n\n    def solve():\n        # Handle input and output\n        ...\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of p allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers A and B. The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.\n\n    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. \n\n    Key code snippet for counting divisors:\n    ```python\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
