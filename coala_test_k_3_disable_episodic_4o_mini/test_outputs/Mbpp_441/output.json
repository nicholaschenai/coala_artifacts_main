    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the surface area of a cube given the length of one of its sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The surface area of a cube can be calculated using the formula \\(6 \\times \\text{side}^2\\), where \"side\" is the length of one edge of the cube. This is because a cube has six faces, and each face is a square with an area equal to the side length squared.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION surfacearea_cube(side):\n       RETURN 6 * (side * side)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef surfacearea_cube(side):\n    # Calculate the surface area of a cube\n    # The formula for the surface area of a cube is 6 * side^2\n    return 6 * (side * side)\n\n```",
