    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights gained from the previous attempts and the understanding that the function should accept two separate parameters (real and imaginary parts), I will correct the implementation to ensure it works as intended. The function will take the real part as a float and the imaginary part as a float, and it will compute the angle using the `atan2` function.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to calculate the angle of a complex number\ndef angle_complex(real, imag):\n    # Use atan2 to calculate the angle in radians\n    return math.atan2(imag, real)\n\n# The function can be called with the real and imaginary parts of a complex number\n```\n\nThis implementation correctly accepts two parameters: `real` (the real part) and `imag` (the imaginary part), and it calculates the angle in radians using the `atan2` function. This should now align with the expected input format of the test case.",
