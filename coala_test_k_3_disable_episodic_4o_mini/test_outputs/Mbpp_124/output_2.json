    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights gained from the previous attempts, I will revert to the original function signature that accepts two separate parameters for the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. I will ensure that the function correctly calculates the angle using the `atan2` function.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to calculate the angle of a complex number\ndef angle_complex(real, imag):\n    # Use atan2 to calculate the angle in radians\n    return math.atan2(imag, real)\n\n# The function can be called with the real and imaginary parts of a complex number\n```\n\nThis implementation now correctly accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively. The angle is calculated using the `atan2` function, which is appropriate for this task.",
