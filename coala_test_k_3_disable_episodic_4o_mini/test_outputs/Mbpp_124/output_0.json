    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the angle of a complex number in radians. The angle is determined based on the position of the complex number in the Cartesian plane, where the real part is the x-coordinate and the imaginary part is the y-coordinate.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the angle of a complex number, we can use the `atan2` function, which computes the angle from the positive x-axis to the point represented by the complex number. The `atan2` function takes two arguments: the y-coordinate (imaginary part) and the x-coordinate (real part). This will give us the angle in radians.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function angle_complex(real, imag):\n       return atan2(imag, real)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to calculate the angle of a complex number\ndef angle_complex(real, imag):\n    # Use atan2 to calculate the angle in radians\n    return math.atan2(imag, real)\n\n# The function can be called with a complex number's real and imaginary parts\n```",
