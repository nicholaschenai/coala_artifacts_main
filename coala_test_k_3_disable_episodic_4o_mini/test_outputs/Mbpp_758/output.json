    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of lists (sublists) and counts how many times each unique sublist appears. Each sublist should be converted to a tuple in the output dictionary, where the keys are the tuples and the values are their respective counts.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each unique sublist. We will iterate through the input list, convert each sublist to a tuple (since lists are not hashable), and update the count in the dictionary. Finally, we will return the dictionary.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function unique_sublists(input_list):\n       create an empty dictionary called count_dict\n       for each sublist in input_list:\n           convert sublist to a tuple\n           if tuple is already in count_dict:\n               increment its count\n           else:\n               add it to count_dict with a count of 1\n       return count_dict\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef unique_sublists(input_list):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store counts of each unique sublist\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in input_list:\n        # Convert the sublist to a tuple\n        sublist_tuple = tuple(sublist)\n        \n        # If the tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if sublist_tuple in count_dict:\n            count_dict[sublist_tuple] += 1\n        # Otherwise, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[sublist_tuple] = 1\n            \n    # Return the dictionary containing the counts of each unique sublist\n    return count_dict\n```",
