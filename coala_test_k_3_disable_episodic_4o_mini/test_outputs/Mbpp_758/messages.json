Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.\n\n    2. **Data Structure**: It uses a dictionary (`scores`) to map the difficulty score (n) to a list of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping of problems with the same difficulty.\n\n    3. **Pairing and Sorting**: For each problem, the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask are paired using a dictionary. The scores are then sorted, which simplifies the comparison of contestant numbers.\n\n    4. **Counting Decreases**: The solution counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases as it moves through the sorted scores. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent elements.\n\n    5. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores for all problems, the solution sorts the unique difficulty scores and then sorts the problem indices for each score before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the required order.\n\n    6. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.\n\n    In contrast to my initial approach, the official solution is more concise and leverages Python's built-in data structures effectively. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly mapping scores to problem indices, which simplifies the sorting and output process. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can simplify grouping and sorting tasks in programming challenges.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to determine the difficulty of contest problems based on their subtasks, which involved calculating how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask decreased as we sorted the subtasks by score. The solution involved reading input data, processing it to count the decreases, and then sorting the problems based on their difficulty.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate and sort data structures effectively. I utilized tuples to store the difficulty of each problem and sorted them based on the defined criteria. The approach of pairing scores with the number of contestants and sorting them was straightforward and effective.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, and the code passed all tests without any errors. The key takeaway was the importance of careful data handling and sorting, especially when dealing with multiple criteria for comparison. The solution was efficient given the constraints, and I learned that maintaining clarity in the logic flow is crucial for solving such problems. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def main():\n        P, S = map(int, input().split())\n        difficulties = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, P + 1):\n            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))\n        \n            n = 0\n            for k in range(1, S):\n                if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:\n                    n += 1\n        \n            difficulties.append((n, i))\n    \n        difficulties.sort()\n    \n        for difficulty in difficulties:\n            print(difficulty[1])\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding sorting and counting mechanisms in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
