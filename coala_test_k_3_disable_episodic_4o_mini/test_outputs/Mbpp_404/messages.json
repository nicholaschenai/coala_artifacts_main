The key insight is the use of the `min` function to keep track of the lexicographically smallest string encountered during the iterations. This approach is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in string comparison capabilities.\n\n    One notable aspect of the official solution is its simplicity and clarity. It maintains a single variable `answer` initialized to the original string, which is updated whenever a smaller string is found. This avoids the need for an additional list to store results, making the code more concise.\n\n    In terms of performance, both the official solution and my approach have similar time complexity, as they both involve nested loops iterating through the string. However, the official solution is slightly more efficient in terms of space since it does not require an extra list to store intermediate results.\n\n    Overall, the official solution reinforces the importance of leveraging built-in functions for comparisons and maintaining clarity in variable usage. It serves as a reminder to focus on simplicity and efficiency in problem-solving.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of p allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers A and B. The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.\n\n    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. \n\n    Key code snippet for counting divisors:\n    ```python\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reference Code (Not callable)]:\n\n    [description]\n    The function calculates the minimum number of operations required to reduce a given integer to 1, where the allowed operations are dividing by 2 if the number is even, or adding or subtracting 1 if the number is odd. It first checks if the input is 1, in which case it returns 0 since no operations are needed. For even numbers, it recursively calls itself with the number divided by 2, adding one to the operation count. For odd numbers, it explores both possibilities of adding or subtracting 1, and returns the minimum of the two results, again adding one to the operation count. This process continues until the base case is reached. The function effectively uses recursion to explore the optimal path to reach the target value.\n\n    [end of description]\n    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to optimize operations on integers, particularly in algorithm design and competitive programming. It can be applied in problems involving number transformations, dynamic programming, or recursive problem-solving techniques. Understanding how to minimize operations can also be beneficial in real-world applications such as resource management, where reducing steps or costs is crucial.\n\n\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            # Base case: if n is 1, no operations are needed\n            if n == 1:\n                return 0\n            # If n is even, we can divide it by 2\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                return 1 + self.integerReplacement(n // 2)\n            else:\n                # If n is odd, we can either add 1 or subtract 1\n                return 1 + min(self.integerReplacement(n + 1), self.integerReplacement(n - 1))\n\n[/Reference Code (Not callable)]\n\n"
