    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the product of all numbers in a given list and then finds the remainder when this product is divided by a specified integer `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list of numbers, multiply them together while keeping track of the product modulo `n`. This way, we avoid overflow issues that can arise from multiplying large numbers. At the end of the iteration, we will return the final product modulo `n`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_remainder(array, n):\n       initialize product as 1\n       for each number in array:\n           product = (product * number) % n\n       return product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_remainder(array, n):\n    # Initialize the product to 1\n    product = 1\n    # Iterate through each number in the array\n    for number in array:\n        # Update the product with the current number, taking modulo n\n        product = (product * number) % n\n    # Return the final product modulo n\n    return product\n```",
