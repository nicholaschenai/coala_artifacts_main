The core concept involved sorting the prices to prioritize cheaper chocolates, allowing for the maximization of the quantity purchased within the budget constraints.\n\n    The solution strategy was straightforward: sort the prices in ascending order, then iterate through the sorted list, keeping track of the total spent and the number of chocolates bought. The iteration stops when adding another chocolate's price would exceed the budget. This greedy approach effectively ensures that the maximum number of chocolates is purchased.\n\n    The implementation was successful, with the provided code passing the sample test case. The key takeaway is the importance of sorting and a greedy algorithm in optimization problems involving budget constraints. The solution was efficient and adhered to the problem's constraints, demonstrating a clear understanding of the requirements. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):\n        prices.sort()\n        total_spent = 0\n        chocolates_bought = 0\n    \n        for price in prices:\n            if total_spent + price <= k:\n                total_spent += price\n                chocolates_bought += 1\n            else:\n                break\n    \n        return chocolates_bought\n\n    n, k = map(int, input().split())\n    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    result = max_chocolates(n, k, prices)\n    print(result)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the effectiveness of sorting and greedy algorithms in solving optimization problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.\n\n    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.\n\n    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def largest_prime_factor(n):\n        largest_prime = 1\n        while n % 2 == 0:\n            largest_prime = 2\n            n //= 2\n        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n            while n % i == 0:\n                largest_prime = i\n                n //= i\n        if n > 2:\n            largest_prime = n\n        return largest_prime\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        index = 1\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n            index += 1\n        \n            prime_count = {}\n        \n            for number in elements:\n                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)\n                if largest_prime in prime_count:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1\n                else:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1\n        \n            max_count = -1\n            result_prime = -1\n        \n            for prime, count in prime_count.items():\n                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result_prime):\n                    max_count = count\n                    result_prime = prime\n        \n            results.append(result_prime)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine the maximum amount of money Mr. Krabs could collect from a series of rooms using a limited number of keys. The key concepts involved understanding the constraints of unlocking adjacent rooms and optimizing the collection of money from either end of the row of rooms.\n\n    The solution utilized a greedy approach by calculating the total money collectible from both the leftmost and rightmost rooms, given the number of keys available. This involved iterating through the first `k` rooms from the left and the last `k` rooms from the right, then comparing the two totals to find the maximum.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and efficient, handling the constraints well. The code successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The key takeaway was the importance of considering both ends of a linear structure when faced with constraints on access, which is a common pattern in similar optimization problems. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_money(n, A, k):\n        left_money = 0\n        right_money = 0\n    \n        # Calculate money collected from the left\n        for i in range(min(k, n)):\n            left_money += A[i]\n    \n        # Calculate money collected from the right\n        for i in range(min(k, n)):\n            right_money += A[n - 1 - i]\n    \n        # Compare the two scenarios\n        return max(left_money, right_money)\n\n    # Read input values\n    n = int(input())\n    A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    k = int(input())\n\n    # Call the function and print the result\n    result = max_money(n, A, k)\n    print(result)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the value of breaking down problems into manageable parts and considering multiple scenarios to find an optimal solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
