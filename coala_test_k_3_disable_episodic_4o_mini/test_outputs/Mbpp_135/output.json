    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the nth hexagonal number. Hexagonal numbers are a specific sequence of numbers that can be represented in a hexagonal lattice. The nth hexagonal number can be calculated using the formula: H(n) = n * (2n - 1).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the nth hexagonal number, we will use the formula mentioned above. We will take the input n, apply the formula, and return the result. This approach is efficient because it directly computes the value without needing to iterate through previous numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION hexagonal_num(n):\n       RETURN n * (2 * n - 1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef hexagonal_num(n):\n    # Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula H(n) = n * (2n - 1)\n    return n * (2 * n - 1)\n\n# The function hexagonal_num is defined above and can be called with an integer n to get the nth hexagonal number.\n```",
