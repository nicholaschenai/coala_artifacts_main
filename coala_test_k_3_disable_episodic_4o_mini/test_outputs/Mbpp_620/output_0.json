    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find the largest subset of numbers from a given list such that every pair of numbers in that subset is divisible by one another.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will sort the list of numbers first. Then, we will iterate through the sorted list and for each number, we will check how many previous numbers can divide it. We will maintain a count of the largest subset size that can be formed for each number based on the divisibility condition. Finally, we will return the maximum size of these subsets.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function largest_subset(numbers):\n       sort numbers in ascending order\n       create a list dp of size equal to numbers, initialized to 1\n       max_size = 1\n       \n       for i from 1 to length of numbers:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if numbers[i] % numbers[j] == 0:\n                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n                   max_size = max(max_size, dp[i])\n       \n       return max_size\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef largest_subset(numbers):\n    # Step 1: Sort the numbers in ascending order\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Step 2: Create a list to store the size of the largest subset ending at each index\n    dp = [1] * len(numbers)\n    \n    # Step 3: Initialize the maximum size of the subset\n    max_size = 1\n    \n    # Step 4: Iterate through each number in the sorted list\n    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            # Step 5: Check if the current number is divisible by the previous number\n            if numbers[i] % numbers[j] == 0:\n                # Step 6: Update the dp array for the current number\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n                # Step 7: Update the maximum size found so far\n                max_size = max(max_size, dp[i])\n    \n    # Step 8: Return the maximum size of the subset found\n    return max_size\n```",
