INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/436 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the negative numbers from the original list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the input list. For each number, we will check if it is less than zero (i.e., negative). If it is, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing only the negative numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function neg_nos(input_list):
       create an empty list called negative_numbers
       for each number in input_list:
           if number is less than 0:
               add number to negative_numbers
       return negative_numbers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def neg_nos(input_list):
    # Create an empty list to store negative numbers
    negative_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in input_list:
        # Check if the number is negative
        if number < 0:
            # Add the negative number to the list
            negative_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the list of negative numbers
    return negative_numbers

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \( A[i] \) by its index \( i \) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:

    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is "YES". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is "NO". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \( N \) natural numbers.

    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \( N(N + 1)/2 \). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.

    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is zero.
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
       - Returning "NO" otherwise.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
        
            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, A))

    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning "YES" or "NO".
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to identify potential killers in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. The key concept was to determine which members were not reported to by anyone, indicating they were "minor criminals." The solution involved counting how many members reported to each member and then identifying those with a count of zero.

    The approach was straightforward: 
    1. Initialize a list to track the number of reports for each member.
    2. Iterate through the reporting list to populate this count.
    3. Collect members with a count of zero into a separate list.
    4. Sort and output this list.

    The implementation was successful, and the code efficiently handled the constraints provided (up to 100,000 members). The final solution was structured to read input, process the reporting structure, and output the potential killers in ascending order.

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    def find_potential_killers(N, reporting):
        report_count = [0] * (N + 1)
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            R = reporting[i - 1]
            if R != 0:
                report_count[R] += 1
        potential_killers = [i for i in range(1, N + 1) if report_count[i] == 0]
        potential_killers.sort()
        return potential_killers
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding hierarchical structures and efficiently counting relationships, which is a common pattern in problems involving trees or graphs.
