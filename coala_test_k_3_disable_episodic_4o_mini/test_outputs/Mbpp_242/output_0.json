    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that counts the total number of characters in a given string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the input string. The length of a string can be easily obtained using Python's built-in `len()` function, which returns the number of characters in the string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `count_charac` that takes a string as input.\n   - Use the `len()` function to calculate the length of the string.\n   - Return the length as the output.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_charac(s: str) -> int:\n    # Calculate the total number of characters in the string\n    total_characters = len(s)\n    # Return the total count\n    return total_characters\n```",
