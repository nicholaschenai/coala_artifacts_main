    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the difference between the first even number and the first odd number found in a given list of integers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list of numbers. We will keep track of the first even number and the first odd number we encounter. Once we find both, we will calculate the difference between the even number and the odd number. If we do not find either an even or an odd number, we will handle that case appropriately.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function diff_even_odd(numbers):\n       initialize first_even to None\n       initialize first_odd to None\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even and first_even is None:\n               set first_even to number\n           if number is odd and first_odd is None:\n               set first_odd to number\n           if both first_even and first_odd are found:\n               break\n       \n       if both first_even and first_odd are found:\n           return first_even - first_odd\n       else:\n           return some indication of failure (e.g., None or 0)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_first_even(numbers):\n    # This function finds the first even number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            return number\n    return None\n\ndef find_first_odd(numbers):\n    # This function finds the first odd number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            return number\n    return None\n\ndef diff_even_odd(numbers):\n    # Find the first even number\n    first_even = find_first_even(numbers)\n    # Find the first odd number\n    first_odd = find_first_odd(numbers)\n    \n    # If both numbers are found, return their difference\n    if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n        return first_even - first_odd\n    else:\n        return None  # or some indication of failure\n```",
