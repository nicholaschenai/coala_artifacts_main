The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.\n\n    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. \n\n    Key code snippet for counting divisors:\n    ```python\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involves reducing a positive integer `n` to `1` using a minimum number of operations, where the operations depend on whether `n` is even or odd. The core concepts tested here include recursion and decision-making based on the parity of the number. \n\n    The solution was implemented using a recursive approach, where the function checks if `n` is even or odd. If even, it divides `n` by `2` and counts that as one operation. If odd, it explores both options (adding or subtracting `1`) and takes the minimum of the two results. This approach effectively captures the necessary operations to reach `1`.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the recursive strategy is effective for this problem. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution was efficient for the given constraints. The recursive nature of the solution allows for clear logic flow, although it could be optimized further using memoization to avoid redundant calculations in larger inputs. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            if n == 1:\n                return 0\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                return 1 + self.integerReplacement(n // 2)\n            else:\n                return 1 + min(self.integerReplacement(n + 1), self.integerReplacement(n - 1))\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays containing exactly `k` odd numbers from a given list of integers. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving subarrays and counts.\n\n    The core concept involved maintaining a count of odd numbers within a window defined by two pointers (left and right). As the right pointer expanded the window, the odd count was updated. If the count exceeded `k`, the left pointer was incremented to reduce the count back to `k`. When the count matched `k`, the number of valid subarrays was calculated by counting the even numbers to the left of the current window.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the sliding window technique is suitable for this type of problem. The key takeaway is the importance of managing two pointers to dynamically adjust the window size while keeping track of specific conditions (in this case, the count of odd numbers). \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n            result = 0\n            left = 0\n            odd_count = 0\n        \n            for right in range(len(nums)):\n                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:\n                    odd_count += 1\n            \n                while odd_count > k:\n                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:\n                        odd_count -= 1\n                    left += 1\n            \n                if odd_count == k:\n                    temp_left = left\n                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:\n                        temp_left += 1\n                    result += (temp_left - left + 1)\n        \n            return result\n    ``` \n\n    This approach effectively counts the desired subarrays while maintaining a linear time complexity, making it suitable for larger input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
