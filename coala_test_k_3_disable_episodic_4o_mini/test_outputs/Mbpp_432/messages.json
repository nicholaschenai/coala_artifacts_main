Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Discriminant Check**: The solution first checks if the expression \\( (H^4 - 16S^2) \\) is negative. If it is, it immediately outputs -1, indicating that a triangle cannot be formed. This is a crucial step to avoid unnecessary calculations when the conditions for forming a triangle are not met.\n\n    2. **Calculating the Base and Height**: The solution uses a mathematical approach to derive the lengths of the triangle's legs (base \\( B \\) and height \\( P \\)). It calculates \\( B \\) using the formula:\n       \\[\n       B = \\frac{\\sqrt{H^2 + \\sqrt{H^4 - 16S^2}}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n       \\]\n       This formula effectively derives one leg of the triangle based on the hypotenuse and area.\n\n    3. **Calculating the Other Leg**: The height \\( P \\) is calculated using the area:\n       \\[\n       P = \\frac{2S}{B}\n       \\]\n       This ensures that the area condition is satisfied.\n\n    4. **Output Formatting**: The solution ensures that the output is formatted to six decimal places, which is important for precision in floating-point arithmetic.\n\n    5. **Sorting the Sides**: The solution checks which of the two legs \\( B \\) and \\( P \\) is larger and prints them in non-decreasing order along with the hypotenuse \\( H \\).\n\n    Overall, the official solution is efficient and leverages mathematical properties effectively, reducing the complexity of the problem. My initial approach was more verbose and involved solving a quadratic equation, which, while valid, was not as direct or efficient as the method used in the official solution. The official solution's use of direct calculations and checks for feasibility before proceeding with further calculations is a valuable lesson in optimizing problem-solving strategies.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

However, the assertion itself does not clarify how the third value (35) is used in the calculation of the median length.\n   - Since the assertion indicates that the output should be 20 when the inputs are 15, 25, and 35, I need to reevaluate how to incorporate all three inputs into the calculation.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will redefine the function to accept three parameters and determine how to compute the median length based on these three values. \n\nThe median length of a trapezium can be calculated as the average of the two parallel sides, which are the first two inputs.
