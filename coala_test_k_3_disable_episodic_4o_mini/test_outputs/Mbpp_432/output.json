The function will now take three lengths as input, but we will only use the first two lengths to calculate the median, as the assertion suggests that the output should be based on the first two values.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef median_trapezium(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> float:\n    # Calculate the median length of the trapezium\n    # The median length is the average of the first two lengths\n    return (a + b) / 2\n\n# The function is declared last as per the instructions\n```",
