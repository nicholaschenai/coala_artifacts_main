    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the median length of a trapezium given the lengths of its two parallel sides. The function should return the median length, which is the average of the two lengths.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the median length of a trapezium, we need to take the two lengths of the parallel sides, add them together, and then divide by 2. This will give us the average length, which is the median length of the trapezium.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION median_trapezium(a, b):\n       RETURN (a + b) / 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef median_trapezium(a: int, b: int) -> float:\n    # Calculate the median length of the trapezium\n    # The median length is the average of the two parallel sides\n    return (a + b) / 2\n\n# The function is declared last as per the instructions\n```",
