Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/280 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a specific element exists in a given list (array). If the element is found, the function should return a tuple containing `True` and the index of that element. If the element is not found, it should return a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and check each element to see if it matches the target element. If we find a match, we will return `True` along with the index of that element. If we finish checking all elements without finding a match, we will return `False` and `-1`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sequential_search(array, element):
       for index from 0 to length of array - 1:
           if array[index] is equal to element:
               return (True, index)
       return (False, -1)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sequential_search(array, element):
    # Iterate through the array using index
    for index in range(len(array)):
        # Check if the current element matches the target element
        if array[index] == element:
            # If found, return True and the index
            return (True, index)
    # If not found, return False and -1
    return (False, -1)

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the number of ways to remove a non-empty contiguous subsequence from a given sequence of integers such that the remaining sequence is non-empty and strictly increasing. The solution involved iterating through all possible contiguous subsequences to remove and checking if the remaining sequence met the strictly increasing condition.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate and evaluate subsequences efficiently. The approach involved two nested loops to consider all possible starting and ending indices for the subsequence to be removed. After forming the remaining sequence, a helper function was used to check if it was strictly increasing.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was straightforward. The helper function `is_strictly_increasing` was crucial for validating the remaining sequence. The solution was efficient enough given the constraints, but it could be optimized further for larger inputs by avoiding the creation of new lists for the remaining sequence.

    Here’s the key code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def is_strictly_increasing(sequence):
        for i in range(1, len(sequence)):
            if sequence[i] <= sequence[i - 1]:
                return False
        return True

    def count_ways_to_remove_subsequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
            count = 0
        
            for start in range(N):
                for end in range(start, N):
                    remaining_sequence = A[0:start] + A[end + 1:N]
                    if remaining_sequence and is_strictly_increasing(remaining_sequence):
                        count += 1
        
            print(count)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding subsequences and their properties, as well as the need for efficient checks when dealing with potentially large datasets.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \( A[i] \) by its index \( i \) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:

    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is "YES". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is "NO". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \( N \) natural numbers.

    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \( N(N + 1)/2 \). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.

    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is zero.
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
       - Returning "NO" otherwise.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
        
            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, A))

    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning "YES" or "NO".
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
