INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/607 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that searches for a specific substring (pattern) within a given string. If the substring is found, the function should return the substring itself along with its starting and ending indices in the original string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in string methods in Python. We will search for the substring using the `find` method, which returns the starting index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is found, we can calculate the ending index by adding the length of the substring to the starting index. Finally, we will return the substring along with its starting and ending indices.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_literals(string, pattern):
       start_index = string.find(pattern)  // Find the starting index of the pattern
       if start_index is not -1:  // Check if the pattern was found
           end_index = start_index + length of pattern  // Calculate the ending index
           return (pattern, start_index, end_index)  // Return the result
       else:
           return None  // Return None if the pattern is not found
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_literals(string: str, pattern: str) -> tuple:
    # Find the starting index of the pattern in the string
    start_index = string.find(pattern)
    
    # Check if the pattern was found
    if start_index != -1:
        # Calculate the ending index
        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)
        # Return the matching substring and its indices
        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)
    else:
        # Return None if the pattern is not found
        return None

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to construct a pyramid of strings based on a given string `S` and answer multiple queries about the occurrences of a smaller string `T` in specific rows of the pyramid. The key concepts involved string manipulation, cyclic indexing, and substring searching.

    The solution involved two main functions: one to construct the `N`-th row of the pyramid by cycling through `S`, and another to count the occurrences of `T` in that row. The approach was straightforward, iterating through the row string to check for matches with `T`. 

    One important aspect was handling large values for `N` (up to 10^9). However, the solution constructed the row string directly for each query, which could be inefficient for large `N`. In practice, this worked for the provided test cases but could lead to performance issues if `N` were significantly larger. 

    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the logic for substring counting and cyclic string construction was sound. Future improvements could focus on optimizing the row construction to avoid unnecessary string concatenation for large `N`. 

    Hereâ€™s the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def count_occurrences(row_string, T):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(row_string) - len(T) + 1):
            if row_string[i:i + len(T)] == T:
                count += 1
        return count

    def get_row_string(S, N):
        row_string = ""
        for i in range(N):
            row_string += S[i % len(S)]
        return row_string
    ``` 

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of considering performance implications when dealing with potentially large inputs in string manipulation problems.
