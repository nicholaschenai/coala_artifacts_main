Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters, and the task was to compute the product of these counts for each digit in the input string, returning the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n    The core concept tested was the understanding of mapping digits to their respective letter counts and efficiently calculating the product of these counts. The solution involved using a dictionary to store the mappings and iterating through the input string to compute the total combinations.\n\n    The implemented solution was straightforward and effective, utilizing basic arithmetic and modular operations to handle potentially large numbers. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases successfully. The final code efficiently handled the constraints, including the maximum length of the input string and multiple test cases. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def count_combinations(S):\n        digit_to_count = {\n            '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3,\n            '7': 4, '8': 3, '9': 4\n        }\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        result = 1\n        for char in S:\n            result = (result * digit_to_count[char]) % MOD\n        return result\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mappings and modular arithmetic in combinatorial problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, specifically after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements. The key insight was recognizing that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to the Pisano period. This allowed for efficient computation even for very large values of N (up to 10^18).\n\n    The solution was structured into three main functions: one to compute the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using the Pisano period, another to determine the last remaining number after the removal process, and a final function to handle input and output. The approach of reducing N by half in each iteration of the removal process was effective, as it directly correlated with the position in the last digits array.\n\n    The final implementation passed the provided test cases successfully, demonstrating that the strategy of leveraging the periodicity of Fibonacci last digits was both efficient and effective. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The solution is useful for similar problems involving sequences and periodicity. \n\n    Key code snippets:\n    ```python\n    def last_digit_fibonacci(n):\n        # Calculate the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using Pisano period\n        ...\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(n):\n        # Find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements\n        ...\n\n    def solve():\n        # Handle input and output\n        ...\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
