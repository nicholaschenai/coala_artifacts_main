    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we need to find the average of \\(1^3\\) and \\(2^3\\).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers, we can follow these steps:\n   - Calculate the cube of each number from 1 to `n`.\n   - Sum all these cubes.\n   - Divide the total sum by `n` to get the average.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_Average_Of_Cube(n):\n       total_sum = 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           total_sum += i^3\n       average = total_sum / n\n       return average\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_Average_Of_Cube(n):\n    # Initialize the total sum of cubes\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Add the cube of the current number to the total sum\n        total_sum += i ** 3\n    \n    # Calculate the average by dividing the total sum by n\n    average = total_sum / n\n    \n    # Return the calculated average\n    return average\n```",
