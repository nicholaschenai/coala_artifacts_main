    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that checks if a given list of numbers contains consecutive integers. For example, the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] should return True because all the numbers are consecutive.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if the numbers in the list are consecutive, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, we need to find the minimum and maximum values in the list.\n   - Then, we can check if the range between the minimum and maximum values matches the length of the list minus one. If they match, it means all numbers in that range are present in the list, indicating that the numbers are consecutive.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_Consecutive(numbers):\n       if the list is empty:\n           return False\n       find the minimum value in the list\n       find the maximum value in the list\n       calculate the expected length of consecutive numbers as (max - min + 1)\n       if the expected length equals the length of the list:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(numbers):\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        return False\n    \n    # Find the minimum and maximum values in the list\n    min_value = min(numbers)\n    max_value = max(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the expected length of consecutive numbers\n    expected_length = max_value - min_value + 1\n    \n    # Check if the expected length matches the actual length of the list\n    return expected_length == len(numbers)\n```",
