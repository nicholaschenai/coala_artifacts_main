The core concept was to check if the difference between the current cumulative sum and `k` had been seen before, which would indicate the presence of a valid subarray.\n\n    However, the initial implementation had a flaw in the order of operations, leading to incorrect counts due to potential double counting of overlapping subarrays. The key insight was to ensure that the hashmap was updated after checking for the count of valid subarrays. This adjustment allowed the solution to correctly count only the valid subarrays that end at the current index.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def subarraySum(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n            cumulative_sum_count = {0: 1}  # To handle the case when cumulative sum equals k\n            cumulative_sum = 0\n            count = 0\n\n            for num in nums:\n                cumulative_sum += num\n            \n                if (cumulative_sum - k) in cumulative_sum_count:\n                    count += cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum - k]\n            \n                if cumulative_sum in cumulative_sum_count:\n                    cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum] += 1\n                else:\n                    cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum] = 1\n        \n            return count\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing state updates in algorithms that rely on cumulative calculations and hashmaps, particularly in avoiding double counting scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to find the number of ways to express a natural number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \\( K \\). The solution involved a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the valid combinations without repeating calculations.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the use of recursion to explore combinations while ensuring uniqueness of integers. The recursive function `countWays` was designed to track the current sum and the last integer used, preventing the reuse of integers. Memoization was implemented to store previously computed results for specific states, which significantly improved performance.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, reading multiple test cases and producing the correct results. The code was structured to first define helper functions and then the main function, adhering to the specified format. Overall, the approach was effective, and the solution passed all provided test cases without errors. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countWays(N, K, current, last, memo):\n        # Base case: if current sum equals N, we found a valid way\n        if current == N:\n            return 1\n        # If current sum exceeds N, this path is invalid\n        if current > N:\n            return 0\n        # Check if the result is already computed\n        if (current, last) in memo:\n            return memo[(current, last)]\n    \n        totalWays = 0\n        # Start from the next integer after 'last'\n        for i in range(last + 1, N + 1):\n            totalWays += countWays(N, K, current + i**K, i, memo)\n    \n        # Store the result in memoization dictionary\n        memo[(current, last)] = totalWays\n        return totalWays\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recursion and memoization in solving combinatorial problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
