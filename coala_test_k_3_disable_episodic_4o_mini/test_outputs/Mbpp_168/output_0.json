    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that counts how many times a specific number appears in a given list of numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and maintain a count of how many times we encounter the specified number. We will start with a count of zero and increase it each time we find a match.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function frequency(numbers, target):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number equals target:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef frequency(numbers, target):\n    # Initialize a count variable to keep track of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the provided list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number matches the target\n        if number == target:\n            # Increment the count if there's a match\n            count += 1\n            \n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n```",
