The challenge involved ensuring that tiles from a single box were used to tile two rooms, one in each house, and that the total area of the rooms matched the number of tiles.\n\n    The core concept revolved around checking pairs of rooms to see if their combined area equaled the number of tiles in an even-indexed box. The solution involved iterating through all boxes and checking all possible pairs of rooms, which could be computationally expensive given the constraints (up to \\(10^{12}\\) for N). \n\n    The initial approach was to use nested loops to check each box and room combination, but this would not scale well for large values of N. However, the provided solution worked correctly for smaller inputs, as evidenced by passing the sample test case.\n\n    In future implementations, a more efficient algorithm would be necessary to handle larger values of N, possibly by leveraging mathematical properties of perfect squares or optimizing the search for room pairs. The final code snippet that worked for the sample input is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(N):\n        total_rooms = 0\n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                for j1 in range(1, N + 1):\n                    for j2 in range(1, N + 1):\n                        if j1 != j2 and j1 * j1 + j2 * j2 == i:\n                            total_rooms += 2\n                            break\n        return total_rooms\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary highlights the problem-solving approach, the challenges faced, and the need for optimization in future attempts.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved calculating the number of possible letter combinations that can be formed from a string of digits based on a traditional mobile keypad mapping. Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters, and the task was to compute the product of these counts for each digit in the input string, returning the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n    The core concept tested was the understanding of mapping digits to their respective letter counts and efficiently calculating the product of these counts. The solution involved using a dictionary to store the mappings and iterating through the input string to compute the total combinations.\n\n    The implemented solution was straightforward and effective, utilizing basic arithmetic and modular operations to handle potentially large numbers. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases successfully. The final code efficiently handled the constraints, including the maximum length of the input string and multiple test cases. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def count_combinations(S):\n        digit_to_count = {\n            '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3,\n            '7': 4, '8': 3, '9': 4\n        }\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        result = 1\n        for char in S:\n            result = (result * digit_to_count[char]) % MOD\n        return result\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mappings and modular arithmetic in combinatorial problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to find the number of ways to express a natural number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \\( K \\). The solution involved a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the valid combinations without repeating calculations.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the use of recursion to explore combinations while ensuring uniqueness of integers. The recursive function `countWays` was designed to track the current sum and the last integer used, preventing the reuse of integers. Memoization was implemented to store previously computed results for specific states, which significantly improved performance.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, reading multiple test cases and producing the correct results. The code was structured to first define helper functions and then the main function, adhering to the specified format. Overall, the approach was effective, and the solution passed all provided test cases without errors. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countWays(N, K, current, last, memo):\n        # Base case: if current sum equals N, we found a valid way\n        if current == N:\n            return 1\n        # If current sum exceeds N, this path is invalid\n        if current > N:\n            return 0\n        # Check if the result is already computed\n        if (current, last) in memo:\n            return memo[(current, last)]\n    \n        totalWays = 0\n        # Start from the next integer after 'last'\n        for i in range(last + 1, N + 1):\n            totalWays += countWays(N, K, current + i**K, i, memo)\n    \n        # Store the result in memoization dictionary\n        memo[(current, last)] = totalWays\n        return totalWays\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recursion and memoization in solving combinatorial problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
