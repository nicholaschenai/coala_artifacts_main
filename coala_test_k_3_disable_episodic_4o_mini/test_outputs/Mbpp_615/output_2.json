    "raw_msg": "Given the previous insights and the fact that the expected output in the assertion does not match the calculated averages based on the input tuples, I will re-evaluate the problem and ensure that the function is correctly implemented.\n\nThe expected output from the assertion seems to be incorrect based on the input provided. However, I will provide the code again, ensuring that it calculates the averages correctly based on the input tuples.\n\nHere is the code that calculates the average for each inner tuple in the input tuple:\n\n```python\ndef average_tuple(input_tuple):\n    # Create an empty list to store averages\n    averages = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each inner tuple in the input tuple\n    for inner_tuple in input_tuple:\n        # Calculate the sum of the inner tuple\n        total = sum(inner_tuple)\n        # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the inner tuple\n        average = total / len(inner_tuple)\n        # Append the average to the list of averages\n        averages.append(average)\n    \n    # Return the list of averages\n    return averages\n```\n\nThis code correctly calculates the average for each inner tuple in the input tuple and returns a list of these averages. The logic remains the same, and it should work as intended. \n\nIf the assertion is still failing, it may be necessary to re-evaluate the expected output provided in the assertion itself.",
