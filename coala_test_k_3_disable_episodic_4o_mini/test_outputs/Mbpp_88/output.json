    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary that shows how many times each unique integer appears in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of integers and keep track of the count of each integer using a dictionary. For each integer in the list, we will check if it is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, we will increment its count; if it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, we will return the dictionary containing the frequency of each integer.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function freq_count(input_list):\n       create an empty dictionary called frequency\n       for each number in input_list:\n           if number is in frequency:\n               increment frequency[number] by 1\n           else:\n               set frequency[number] to 1\n       return frequency\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef freq_count(input_list):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element\n    frequency = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in input_list:\n        # If the number is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if number in frequency:\n            frequency[number] += 1\n        # If the number is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n        else:\n            frequency[number] = 1\n            \n    # Return the dictionary containing the frequency of each element\n    return frequency\n```",
