INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/244 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a number as input and returns the smallest perfect square that is greater than this number. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the next perfect square greater than a given number, we can:
   - Start by determining the integer square root of the given number. This will give us the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the number.
   - Increment this integer by one to find the next integer.
   - Square this incremented integer to get the next perfect square.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function next_Perfect_Square(n):
       integer_sqrt = floor(sqrt(n))  // Find the integer square root of n
       next_integer = integer_sqrt + 1  // Increment the integer square root
       next_perfect_square = next_integer * next_integer  // Square the next integer
       return next_perfect_square  // Return the next perfect square
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def next_Perfect_Square(n):
    # Find the integer square root of n
    integer_sqrt = int(n**0.5)
    # Increment the integer square root
    next_integer = integer_sqrt + 1
    # Square the next integer to get the next perfect square
    next_perfect_square = next_integer * next_integer
    # Return the next perfect square
    return next_perfect_square
```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides a much more efficient approach to the problem than my initial attempt. The key insight is recognizing that the number of rooms that can be tiled completely is directly related to the largest perfect square that can be formed with the tiles available. 

    ### Key Steps in the Official Solution:
    1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads multiple test cases efficiently using `stdin`.
    2. **Dividing by 2**: The number of tiles in each box is halved (`n //= 2`) because each box can only tile two rooms.
    3. **Calculating Perfect Squares**: The maximum number of rooms that can be tiled is determined by calculating `2 * int(n**0.5)`, which gives the count of rooms that can be tiled using the largest perfect square less than or equal to `n`.

    ### Insights:
    - My initial approach involved iterating through all possible room pairs, which is computationally expensive and inefficient, especially given the constraints (up to \(10^{12}\)).
    - The official solution leverages mathematical properties of perfect squares and the relationship between the number of tiles and room areas, leading to a constant time complexity for each test case after the initial input read.
    - This experience highlights the importance of recognizing patterns and mathematical relationships in problems, which can significantly simplify the solution and improve performance. 

    In future problems, I should consider looking for mathematical shortcuts or properties that can reduce the complexity of the solution rather than relying solely on brute force methods.
[/Reflection]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.

    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.

    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def largest_prime_factor(n):
        largest_prime = 1
        while n % 2 == 0:
            largest_prime = 2
            n //= 2
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            while n % i == 0:
                largest_prime = i
                n //= i
        if n > 2:
            largest_prime = n
        return largest_prime

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        index = 1
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))
            index += 1
        
            prime_count = {}
        
            for number in elements:
                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)
                if largest_prime in prime_count:
                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1
                else:
                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1
        
            max_count = -1
            result_prime = -1
        
            for prime, count in prime_count.items():
                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result_prime):
                    max_count = count
                    result_prime = prime
        
            results.append(result_prime)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```
