    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that finds the next perfect square that is greater than a given number. For example, if the input is 35, the next perfect square is 36.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the next perfect square greater than a given number, we can:\n   - Calculate the integer square root of the given number.\n   - Increment this integer by one to get the next whole number.\n   - Square this incremented number to get the next perfect square.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function next_Perfect_Square(n):\n       sqrt_n = integer square root of n\n       next_integer = sqrt_n + 1\n       next_perfect_square = next_integer squared\n       return next_perfect_square\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef next_Perfect_Square(n):\n    # Calculate the integer square root of n\n    sqrt_n = int(n**0.5)\n    # Increment the integer to get the next whole number\n    next_integer = sqrt_n + 1\n    # Square the incremented integer to get the next perfect square\n    next_perfect_square = next_integer * next_integer\n    # Return the next perfect square\n    return next_perfect_square\n```",
