    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that checks if a given number can be expressed as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. For example, the number 10 can be represented as \\(2^3 + 2^1\\) (which is 8 + 2), so the function should return `True` for 10.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if a number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2, we can use the binary representation of the number. Each bit in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2. If a bit is set (1), it means that power of 2 is included in the sum. Therefore, we can simply check if the number is greater than zero, as any positive integer can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):\n       if n > 0:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is greater than zero\n    if n > 0:\n        return True  # Any positive number can be represented as a sum of powers of 2\n    else:\n        return False  # Zero or negative numbers cannot be represented this way\n```",
