    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of lists (a 2D list) and counts how many times each unique element appears across all the lists. The result should be returned as a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements and the values are their respective counts.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element.\n   - Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists.\n   - For each element in the sublist, check if it is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, increment its count; if not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n   - Finally, return the dictionary containing the frequency of each element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function frequency_lists(lists):\n       create an empty dictionary freq\n       for each sublist in lists:\n           for each element in sublist:\n               if element is in freq:\n                   increment freq[element]\n               else:\n                   set freq[element] to 1\n       return freq\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef frequency_lists(lists):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store frequencies\n    freq = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in lists:\n        # Iterate through each element in the current sublist\n        for element in sublist:\n            # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n            if element in freq:\n                freq[element] += 1\n            # If the element is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n            else:\n                freq[element] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing the frequency of each element\n    return freq\n```",
