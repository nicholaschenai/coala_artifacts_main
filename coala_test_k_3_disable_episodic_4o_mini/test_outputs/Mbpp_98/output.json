    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of numbers (in this case, a tuple) and calculates the product of all the numbers in that list. After obtaining the product, the function should divide this product by the number of elements in the list. The result should be a floating-point number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, I will:\n   - Initialize a variable to hold the product of the numbers, starting with a value of 1.\n   - Iterate through each number in the input list, multiplying it to the product variable.\n   - After calculating the total product, I will divide this product by the length of the list to get the final result.\n   - Finally, I will return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function multiply_num(numbers):\n       initialize product to 1\n       for each number in numbers:\n           product = product * number\n       length_of_numbers = length of numbers\n       result = product / length_of_numbers\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef multiply_num(numbers):\n    # Initialize product to 1\n    product = 1\n    # Iterate through each number in the input tuple\n    for number in numbers:\n        product *= number  # Multiply each number to the product\n    # Get the length of the input tuple\n    length_of_numbers = len(numbers)\n    # Divide the product by the length of the tuple\n    result = product / length_of_numbers\n    # Return the final result\n    return result\n```",
