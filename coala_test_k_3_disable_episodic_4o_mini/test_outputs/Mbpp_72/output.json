    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that determines if a given integer can be expressed as the difference between the squares of two integers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   A number can be represented as the difference of two squares if it can be expressed in the form \\( a^2 - b^2 \\), which can be factored into \\( (a - b)(a + b) \\). This means that the number must be expressible as a product of two integers. Notably, all odd numbers can be expressed this way, and even numbers that are not multiples of 4 cannot be expressed as such. Therefore, the function should check if the number is odd or if it is a multiple of 4.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function dif_Square(n):\n       if n is odd:\n           return True\n       else if n is even:\n           if n % 4 == 0:\n               return True\n           else:\n               return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_odd(n):\n    return n % 2 != 0  # Check if the number is odd\n\ndef is_multiple_of_four(n):\n    return n % 4 == 0  # Check if the number is a multiple of 4\n\ndef dif_Square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number can be represented as the difference of two squares\n    if is_odd(n):\n        return True  # All odd numbers can be expressed as such\n    elif n % 2 == 0:\n        return is_multiple_of_four(n)  # Even numbers can only be expressed if they are multiples of 4\n    return False  # This case is for negative numbers or other cases not covered\n```",
