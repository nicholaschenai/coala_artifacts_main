Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/72 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given integer can be expressed as the difference between the squares of two integers. For example, the number 5 can be represented as \(3^2 - 2^2\) (which is 9 - 4).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if a number \(n\) can be expressed as the difference of two squares, we can use the mathematical property that a number can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if it is not of the form \(4k + 2\) for some integer \(k\). This means that if \(n\) modulo 4 equals 2, then it cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares. Otherwise, it can.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `dif_Square(n)`.
   - Check if \(n \mod 4\) equals 2.
     - If it does, return `False`.
     - Otherwise, return `True`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def dif_Square(n):
    # Check if n modulo 4 equals 2
    if n % 4 == 2:
        # If it does, it cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares
        return False
    # Otherwise, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares
    return True

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of p allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers A and B. The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.

    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.

    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. 

    Key code snippet for counting divisors:
    ```python
    def count_divisors(n):
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
        return count
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides a much more efficient approach to the problem than my initial attempt. The key insight is recognizing that the number of rooms that can be tiled completely is directly related to the largest perfect square that can be formed with the tiles available. 

    ### Key Steps in the Official Solution:
    1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads multiple test cases efficiently using `stdin`.
    2. **Dividing by 2**: The number of tiles in each box is halved (`n //= 2`) because each box can only tile two rooms.
    3. **Calculating Perfect Squares**: The maximum number of rooms that can be tiled is determined by calculating `2 * int(n**0.5)`, which gives the count of rooms that can be tiled using the largest perfect square less than or equal to `n`.

    ### Insights:
    - My initial approach involved iterating through all possible room pairs, which is computationally expensive and inefficient, especially given the constraints (up to \(10^{12}\)).
    - The official solution leverages mathematical properties of perfect squares and the relationship between the number of tiles and room areas, leading to a constant time complexity for each test case after the initial input read.
    - This experience highlights the importance of recognizing patterns and mathematical relationships in problems, which can significantly simplify the solution and improve performance. 

    In future problems, I should consider looking for mathematical shortcuts or properties that can reduce the complexity of the solution rather than relying solely on brute force methods.
