    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to write a function that takes a list of lists (sublists) and returns the shortest sublist (the one with the fewest elements).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the shortest sublist, we can iterate through the list of sublists, keeping track of the shortest one we encounter. We will compare the lengths of each sublist and update our result whenever we find a shorter one.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function Find_Min(sublists):\n       initialize shortest_sublist as None\n       for each sublist in sublists:\n           if shortest_sublist is None or length of sublist < length of shortest_sublist:\n               update shortest_sublist to sublist\n       return shortest_sublist\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef Find_Min(sublists):\n    # Initialize the shortest sublist as None\n    shortest_sublist = None\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the provided list of sublists\n    for sublist in sublists:\n        # If shortest_sublist is None or the current sublist is shorter than the shortest found\n        if shortest_sublist is None or len(sublist) < len(shortest_sublist):\n            # Update the shortest sublist to the current one\n            shortest_sublist = sublist\n            \n    # Return the shortest sublist found\n    return shortest_sublist\n```",
