    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should calculate the maximum absolute product of the integers in each tuple and return the highest product found among all tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each tuple in the list, calculate the product of the two integers in the tuple, and keep track of the maximum product encountered. The absolute value of the product will be considered, but since the product of two positive numbers is always positive, we can directly compute the product without needing to take the absolute value.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_product_tuple(tuples):\n       initialize max_product to 0\n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           calculate product as tuple[0] * tuple[1]\n           if product is greater than max_product:\n               update max_product to product\n       return max_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_product_tuple(tuples):\n    # Initialize the maximum product to 0\n    max_product = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuples:\n        # Calculate the product of the two numbers in the tuple\n        product = tup[0] * tup[1]\n        \n        # Update max_product if the current product is greater\n        if product > max_product:\n            max_product = product\n            \n    # Return the maximum product found\n    return max_product\n```",
