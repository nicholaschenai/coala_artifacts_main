Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters, and the task was to compute the product of these counts for each digit in the input string, returning the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n    The core concept tested was the understanding of mapping digits to their respective letter counts and efficiently calculating the product of these counts. The solution involved using a dictionary to store the mappings and iterating through the input string to compute the total combinations.\n\n    The implemented solution was straightforward and effective, utilizing basic arithmetic and modular operations to handle potentially large numbers. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases successfully. The final code efficiently handled the constraints, including the maximum length of the input string and multiple test cases. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def count_combinations(S):\n        digit_to_count = {\n            '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3,\n            '7': 4, '8': 3, '9': 4\n        }\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        result = 1\n        for char in S:\n            result = (result * digit_to_count[char]) % MOD\n        return result\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mappings and modular arithmetic in combinatorial problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by iterating through each character in the string and considering all possible positions for reinserting that character. The key insight is the use of the `min` function to keep track of the lexicographically smallest string encountered during the iterations. This approach is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in string comparison capabilities.\n\n    One notable aspect of the official solution is its simplicity and clarity. It maintains a single variable `answer` initialized to the original string, which is updated whenever a smaller string is found. This avoids the need for an additional list to store results, making the code more concise.\n\n    In terms of performance, both the official solution and my approach have similar time complexity, as they both involve nested loops iterating through the string. However, the official solution is slightly more efficient in terms of space since it does not require an extra list to store intermediate results.\n\n    Overall, the official solution reinforces the importance of leveraging built-in functions for comparisons and maintaining clarity in variable usage. It serves as a reminder to focus on simplicity and efficiency in problem-solving.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
