    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that counts how many times the substring \"std\" appears in a given string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and check for occurrences of the substring \"std\". Each time we find it, we will increment a counter. We will continue this until we have checked the entire string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_occurance(input_string):\n       initialize count to 0\n       set index to 0\n       while index is less than length of input_string:\n           if substring from index to index + 3 is \"std\":\n               increment count\n               move index forward by 3 (to avoid overlapping counts)\n           else:\n               move index forward by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_occurance(input_string: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter for occurrences\n    count = 0\n    # Start index for searching\n    index = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the string until the end\n    while index < len(input_string):\n        # Check if the substring \"std\" is found\n        if input_string[index:index + 3] == \"std\":\n            count += 1  # Increment the count\n            index += 3   # Move index forward by 3 to avoid overlapping\n        else:\n            index += 1   # Move index forward by 1\n    \n    return count  # Return the total count of occurrences\n```",
