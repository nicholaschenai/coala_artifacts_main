The solution utilized a stack to efficiently manage character counts and removals. The core concept was to iterate through the string, pushing characters onto the stack while tracking their counts. When a character's count reached `k`, it was removed from the stack.\n\n    The strategy of using a stack worked effectively, as it allowed for easy access to the last character and its count, facilitating quick updates and removals. The final string was constructed by joining the characters left in the stack, multiplied by their respective counts.\n\n    The implemented solution was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without issues. The key takeaway is the utility of stacks in problems involving consecutive elements and counts, which can simplify the logic and improve efficiency. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n            stack = []\n            for char in s:\n                if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                    stack[-1][1] += 1\n                    if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                        stack.pop()\n                else:\n                    stack.append([char, 1])\n            result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)\n            return result\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring \"abacaba\" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.\n\n    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of \"abacaba\". The logic needed to ensure that after placing \"abacaba\", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. Checking how many times \"abacaba\" already appeared in the string.\n    2. Attempting to place \"abacaba\" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.\n    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.\n    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.\n\n    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            n = case[0]\n            s = case[1]\n            modified_string = list(s)\n\n            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            placed = False\n            for i in range(n - 6):\n                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):\n                    temp_string = modified_string[:]\n                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)\n                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:\n                        modified_string = temp_string\n                        placed = True\n                        break\n\n            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            if final_count != 1:\n                print(\"No\")\n            else:\n                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)\n                print(\"Yes\")\n                print(\"\".join(modified_string))\n\n    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != \"abacaba\"[j]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            s[index + j] = \"abacaba\"[j]\n\n    def count_abacaba(s):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n            if \"\".join(s[i:i + 7]) == \"abacaba\":\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\n    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i] == '?':\n                s[i] = 'z'\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(input())\n        s = input().strip()\n        test_cases.append((n, s))\n\n    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the minimum window substring in a string `S` that contains all characters from another string `T`. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is efficient for this type of problem. The key concepts involved were maintaining character counts and dynamically adjusting the window size using two pointers.\n\n    The implementation involved creating two dictionaries: one for counting characters in `T` and another for the current window in `S`. The algorithm expanded the right pointer to include characters until all required characters were present, then contracted the left pointer to minimize the window size while still containing all characters from `T`. This approach ensured that the solution operated in O(n) time complexity.\n\n    The final code snippet effectively captured this logic:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n            # Character counting and sliding window logic\n            ...\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the sliding window technique proved to be a robust strategy for solving the problem, and the implementation was successful without any unexpected errors. The solution was efficient and met the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
