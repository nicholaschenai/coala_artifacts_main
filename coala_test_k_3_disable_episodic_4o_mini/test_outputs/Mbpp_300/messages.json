The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n

\\index{combinatorics}\n\n    \\key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting\n    combinations of objects.\n    Usually, the goal is to find a way to\n    count the combinations efficiently\n    without generating each combination separately.\n\n    As an example, consider the problem\n    of counting the number of ways to\n    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.\n    For example, there are 8 representations\n    for $4$:\n    \\begin{multicols}{2}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $1+1+1+1$\n    \\item $1+1+2$\n    \\item $1+2+1$\n    \\item $2+1+1$\n    \\item $2+2$\n    \\item $3+1$\n    \\item $1+3$\n    \\item $4$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{multicols}\n\n    A combinatorial problem can often be solved\n    using a recursive function.\n    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$\n    that gives the number of representations for $n$.\n    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.\n    The values of the function\n    can be recursively calculated as follows:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n                   1               & n = 0\\\\\n                   f(0)+f(1)+\\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case is $f(0)=1$,\n    because the empty sum represents the number 0.\n    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to\n    choose the first number of the sum.\n    If the first number is $k$,\n    there are $f(n-k)$ representations\n    for the remaining part of the sum.\n    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values\n    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.\n\n    The first values for the function are:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    f(0) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    f(3) & = & 4 \\\\\n    f(4) & = & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced\n    with a closed-form formula.\n    In this problem,\n    \\[\n    f(n)=2^{n-1},\n    \\]\n    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$\n    possible positions for +-signs in the sum\n    and we can choose any subset of them.\n\n    \\section{Binomial coefficients}\n\n    \\index{binomial coefficient}\n\n    The \\key{binomial coefficient} ${n \\choose k}$\n    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset\n    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, ${5 \\choose 3}=10$,\n    because the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:\n    \\[ \\{1,2,3\\}, \\{1,2,4\\}, \\{1,2,5\\}, \\{1,3,4\\}, \\{1,3,5\\}, \n    \\{1,4,5\\}, \\{2,3,4\\}, \\{2,3,5\\}, \\{2,4,5\\}, \\{3,4,5\\} \\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 1}\n\n    Binomial coefficients can be\n    recursively calculated as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k}\n    \\]\n\n    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.\n    If $x$ is included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k-1$\n    elements from $n-1$ elements,\n    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.\n\n    The base cases for the recursion are\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}  =  {n \\choose n} = 1,\n    \\]\n    because there is always exactly\n    one way to construct an empty subset\n    and a subset that contains all the elements.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 2}\n\n    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\n    \\]\n\n    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.\n    We go through all permutations and always\n    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation\n    in the subset.\n    Since the order of the elements in the subset\n    and outside the subset does not matter,\n    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$\n\n    \\subsubsection{Properties}\n\n    For binomial coefficients,\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n \\choose n-k},\n    \\]\n    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into\n    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements\n    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.\n\n    The sum of binomial coefficients is\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}+{n \\choose 1}+{n \\choose 2}+\\ldots+{n \\choose n}=2^n.\n    \\]\n\n    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''\n    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to\n    the $n$th power:\n\n    \\[ (a+b)^n =\n    {n \\choose 0} a^n b^0 + \n    {n \\choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +\n    \\ldots + \n    {n \\choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +\n    {n \\choose n} a^0 b^n. \\]\n\n
