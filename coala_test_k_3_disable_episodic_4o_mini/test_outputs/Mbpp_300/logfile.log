INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/300 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that counts how many binary sequences of length `2n` exist such that the sum of the first half of the sequence (the first `n` bits) is equal to the sum of the second half (the last `n` bits).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use combinatorial mathematics. The key observation is that for a binary sequence of length `2n`, the sum of the first `n` bits can range from `0` to `n`. For each possible sum `k` (where `k` is the number of `1`s in the first half), we need to find the number of ways to choose `k` `1`s from `n` bits in both halves. The total number of valid sequences will be the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients for each possible sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_binary_seq(n):
       total_count = 0
       for k from 0 to n:
           count_k = binomial_coefficient(n, k)
           total_count += count_k * count_k
       return total_count
       
   function binomial_coefficient(n, k):
       if k > n or k < 0:
           return 0
       result = 1
       for i from 0 to k-1:
           result *= (n - i)
           result /= (i + 1)
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    result = 1
    for i in range(k):
        result *= (n - i)
        result //= (i + 1)  # Use integer division
    return result

def count_binary_seq(n: int) -> float:
    # Initialize total count of valid binary sequences
    total_count = 0
    # Iterate over all possible sums of the first half
    for k in range(n + 1):
        # Calculate the number of ways to choose k 1's from n bits
        count_k = binomial_coefficient(n, k)
        # Add the square of count_k to total_count
        total_count += count_k * count_k
    # Return the total count as a float
    return float(total_count)

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.

    \chapter{Combinatorics}

    \index{combinatorics}

    \key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting
    combinations of objects.
    Usually, the goal is to find a way to
    count the combinations efficiently
    without generating each combination separately.

    As an example, consider the problem
    of counting the number of ways to
    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.
    For example, there are 8 representations
    for $4$:
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1+1+1+1$
    \item $1+1+2$
    \item $1+2+1$
    \item $2+1+1$
    \item $2+2$
    \item $3+1$
    \item $1+3$
    \item $4$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}

    A combinatorial problem can often be solved
    using a recursive function.
    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$
    that gives the number of representations for $n$.
    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.
    The values of the function
    can be recursively calculated as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        f(n) = \begin{cases}
                   1               & n = 0\\
                   f(0)+f(1)+\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case is $f(0)=1$,
    because the empty sum represents the number 0.
    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to
    choose the first number of the sum.
    If the first number is $k$,
    there are $f(n-k)$ representations
    for the remaining part of the sum.
    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values
    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.

    The first values for the function are:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    f(0) & = & 1 \\
    f(1) & = & 1 \\
    f(2) & = & 2 \\
    f(3) & = & 4 \\
    f(4) & = & 8 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced
    with a closed-form formula.
    In this problem,
    \[
    f(n)=2^{n-1},
    \]
    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$
    possible positions for +-signs in the sum
    and we can choose any subset of them.

    \section{Binomial coefficients}

    \index{binomial coefficient}

    The \key{binomial coefficient} ${n \choose k}$
    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset
    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.
    For example, ${5 \choose 3}=10$,
    because the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:
    \[ \{1,2,3\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,2,5\}, \{1,3,4\}, \{1,3,5\}, 
    \{1,4,5\}, \{2,3,4\}, \{2,3,5\}, \{2,4,5\}, \{3,4,5\} \]

    \subsubsection{Formula 1}

    Binomial coefficients can be
    recursively calculated as follows:

    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}
    \]

    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.
    If $x$ is included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k-1$
    elements from $n-1$ elements,
    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.

    The base cases for the recursion are
    \[
    {n \choose 0}  =  {n \choose n} = 1,
    \]
    because there is always exactly
    one way to construct an empty subset
    and a subset that contains all the elements.

    \subsubsection{Formula 2}

    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.
    \]

    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.
    We go through all permutations and always
    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation
    in the subset.
    Since the order of the elements in the subset
    and outside the subset does not matter,
    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$

    \subsubsection{Properties}

    For binomial coefficients,
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n \choose n-k},
    \]
    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into
    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements
    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.

    The sum of binomial coefficients is
    \[
    {n \choose 0}+{n \choose 1}+{n \choose 2}+\ldots+{n \choose n}=2^n.
    \]

    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''
    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to
    the $n$th power:

    \[ (a+b)^n =
    {n \choose 0} a^n b^0 + 
    {n \choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +
    \ldots + 
    {n \choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +
    {n \choose n} a^0 b^n. \]

    \index{Pascal's triangle}

    Binomial coefficients also appear in
    \key{Pascal's triangle}
    where each value equals the sum of two
    above values:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}{0.9}
    \node at (0,0) {1};
    \node at (-0.5,-0.5) {1};
    \node at (0.5,-0.5) {1};
    \node at (-1,-1) {1};
    \node at (0,-1) {2};
    \node at (1,-1) {1};
    \node at (-1.5,-1.5) {1};
    \node at (-0.5,-1.5) {3};
    \node at (0.5,-1.5) {3};
    \node at (1.5,-1.5) {1};
    \node at (-2,-2) {1};
    \node at (-1,-2) {4};
    \node at (0,-2) {6};
    \node at (1,-2) {4};
    \node at (2,-2) {1};

    \node at (1,-2.5) {$\ldots$};
    \node at (2,-2.5) {$\ldots$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Boxes and balls}

    ''Boxes and balls'' is a useful model,
    where we count the ways to
    place $k$ balls in $n$ boxes.
    Let us consider three scenarios:

    \textit{Scenario 1}: Each box can contain
    at most one ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 10 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --
                        (#1+0.5,#2-0.5) -- (#1+0.5,#2+0.5);
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{
        \lax{#1}{#2}{#3}
        \lax{#1+1.2}{#2}{#4}
        \lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}
        \lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}
        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{-4}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    In this scenario, the answer is directly the
    binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 2}: A box can contain multiple balls.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 15 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --

    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}

    The process of placing the balls in the boxes
    can be represented as a string
    that consists of symbols
    ''o'' and ''$\rightarrow$''.
    Initially, assume that we are standing at the leftmost box.
    The symbol ''o'' means that we place a ball
    in the current box, and the symbol
    ''$\rightarrow$'' means that we move to
    the next box to the right.

    Using this notation, each solution is a string
    that contains $k$ times the symbol ''o'' and
    $n-1$ times the symbol ''$\rightarrow$''.
    For example, the upper-right solution
    in the above picture corresponds to the string
    ''$\rightarrow$ $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$''.
    Thus, the number of solutions is
    ${k+n-1 \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 3}: Each box may contain at most one ball,
    and in addition, no two adjacent boxes may both contain a ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/300 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   We need to create a function that counts how many binary sequences of length `2n` exist such that the sum of the first `n` bits is equal to the sum of the last `n` bits. 

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: 
   A binary sequence of length `2n` can be thought of as two halves, each of length `n`. The sum of bits in each half can range from `0` to `n`. For each possible sum `k` (where `0 <= k <= n`), we can count how many ways we can choose `k` bits to be `1` in the first half and `k` bits to be `1` in the second half. The number of ways to choose `k` bits from `n` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(n, k)`. Therefore, the total count of valid sequences can be computed by summing the squares of the binomial coefficients from `0` to `n`.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function count_binary_seq(n):
       total_count = 0
       for k from 0 to n:
           total_count += C(n, k) * C(n, k)  // Square of binomial coefficient
       return total_count
       
   function C(n, k):
       if k > n or k < 0:
           return 0
       if k == 0 or k == n:
           return 1
       result = 1
       for i from 1 to k:
           result = result * (n - i + 1) // i
       return result
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
