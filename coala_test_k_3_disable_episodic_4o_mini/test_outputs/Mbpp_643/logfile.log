INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/643 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z', but only if it is not located at the very beginning or the very end of the string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can check the string for the presence of 'z' starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character. If 'z' is found in this range, we will return `True`. If 'z' is not found or is located at the start or end of the string, we will return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `text_match_wordz_middle` that takes a string as input.
   - Check if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, return `False` (since there can't be a 'z' in the middle).
   - Extract the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character.
   - Check if 'z' is in this substring.
   - Return `True` if 'z' is found, otherwise return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the string is too short to have 'z' in the middle
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Extract the middle part of the string
    middle_substring = s[1:-1]
    
    # Check if 'z' is in the middle substring
    return 'z' in middle_substring

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides a clear and efficient approach to solving the problem of determining if the substring "abacaba" can be formed exactly once in a given string with question marks. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

    1. **Initial Count Check**:
       - The solution starts by counting how many times "abacaba" appears in the string using the `check` function. This is crucial because if it already appears more than once, the answer is immediately "No".

    2. **Handling Existing Occurrences**:
       - If "abacaba" is found exactly once, the solution replaces all remaining question marks with 'z' to ensure no additional occurrences are created.

    3. **Constructive Placement**:
       - If "abacaba" is not found at all, the solution attempts to place it in every possible position in the string. It checks if it can fit by replacing question marks with the corresponding characters from "abacaba".

    4. **Validation After Placement**:
       - After attempting to place "abacaba", the solution checks if the modified string contains exactly one occurrence of "abacaba". If it does, it prints the modified string; otherwise, it continues searching.

    5. **Efficiency**:
       - The solution efficiently iterates through the string and uses a straightforward approach to check and replace characters, ensuring that it operates within the constraints provided.

    ### Reflection on My Approach:
    - My initial approach failed to account for existing occurrences of "abacaba" before attempting to place it, which led to incorrect results in some cases.
    - The official solution's method of checking for existing occurrences first and then attempting to place "abacaba" is more systematic and avoids unnecessary complications.
    - The use of a temporary list to manipulate the string and check conditions is a good practice that I can adopt in future problems.

    ### Conclusion:
    The official solution effectively combines counting, conditional checks, and constructive placement to solve the problem. It serves as a reminder of the importance of validating conditions before making modifications, especially in string manipulation problems.
[/Reflection]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the input string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the string is processed until no "abc" substrings remain.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count("abc")` to check for occurrences, which simplifies the condition for the while loop. In my initial solution, I used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit in terms of counting occurrences. The official solution's method is more efficient in that it directly removes all instances of "abc" in one operation, rather than removing them one at a time.

    Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively, making it both easy to read and efficient. In future implementations, I should consider using similar built-in methods for string manipulation to enhance clarity and performance.

   The task is to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z' anywhere except at the very beginning or the very end of the string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to examine the string and look for the letter 'z'. We will check all characters in the string except for the first and last characters. If we find a 'z' in this range, we will return `True`. If we do not find any 'z' in the specified range, we will return `False`.
