    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z' anywhere except at the very beginning or the very end of the string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to examine the string and look for the letter 'z'. We will check all characters in the string except for the first and last characters. If we find a 'z' in this range, we will return `True`. If we do not find any 'z' in the specified range, we will return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function text_match_wordz_middle(s):\n       if the length of s is less than 3:\n           return False\n       for each character in s from index 1 to length of s - 2:\n           if the character is 'z':\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is too short to contain 'z' in the middle\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Iterate through the string starting from the second character to the second last character\n    for i in range(1, len(s) - 1):\n        # Check if the current character is 'z'\n        if s[i] == 'z':\n            return True  # Found 'z' in the middle, return True\n    \n    return False  # No 'z' found in the middle, return False\n```",
