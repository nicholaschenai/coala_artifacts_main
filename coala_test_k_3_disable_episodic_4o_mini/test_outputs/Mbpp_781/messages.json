The core concepts tested here include recursion and decision-making based on the parity of the number. \n\n    The solution was implemented using a recursive approach, where the function checks if `n` is even or odd. If even, it divides `n` by `2` and counts that as one operation. If odd, it explores both options (adding or subtracting `1`) and takes the minimum of the two results. This approach effectively captures the necessary operations to reach `1`.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the recursive strategy is effective for this problem. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution was efficient for the given constraints. The recursive nature of the solution allows for clear logic flow, although it could be optimized further using memoization to avoid redundant calculations in larger inputs. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            if n == 1:\n                return 0\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                return 1 + self.integerReplacement(n // 2)\n            else:\n                return 1 + min(self.integerReplacement(n + 1), self.integerReplacement(n - 1))\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.\n\n    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.\n\n    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def largest_prime_factor(n):\n        largest_prime = 1\n        while n % 2 == 0:\n            largest_prime = 2\n            n //= 2\n        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n            while n % i == 0:\n                largest_prime = i\n                n //= i\n        if n > 2:\n            largest_prime = n\n        return largest_prime\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        index = 1\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n            index += 1\n        \n            prime_count = {}\n        \n            for number in elements:\n                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)\n                if largest_prime in prime_count:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1\n                else:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1\n        \n            max_count = -1\n            result_prime = -1\n        \n            for prime, count in prime_count.items():\n                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result_prime):\n                    max_count = count\n                    result_prime = prime\n        \n            results.append(result_prime)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of p allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers A and B. The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.\n\n    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. \n\n    Key code snippet for counting divisors:\n    ```python\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
