    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes two lists (or tuples) of numbers and returns a new list (or tuple) containing only the elements that are present in both input lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the shared elements between the two lists, we can convert one of the lists into a set for efficient look-up. Then, we can iterate through the other list and check if each element exists in the set. If it does, we add it to the result list. Finally, we will return the result as a set to ensure uniqueness.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function similar_elements(list1, list2):\n       create an empty set for shared elements\n       convert list1 to a set for fast look-up\n       for each element in list2:\n           if element is in the set created from list1:\n               add element to the set of shared elements\n       return the set of shared elements\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef similar_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Create a set to store shared elements\n    shared_elements = set()\n    \n    # Convert the first list to a set for fast look-up\n    set1 = set(list1)\n    \n    # Iterate through the second list\n    for element in list2:\n        # Check if the element is in the set created from the first list\n        if element in set1:\n            # Add the element to the shared elements set\n            shared_elements.add(element)\n    \n    # Return the set of shared elements\n    return shared_elements\n```",
