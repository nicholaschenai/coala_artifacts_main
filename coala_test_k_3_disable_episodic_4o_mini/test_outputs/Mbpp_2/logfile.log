Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/2 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two lists (or tuples) as input and returns a new list (or tuple) containing only the elements that are present in both input lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the shared elements between the two lists, we can iterate through one of the lists and check if each element is present in the other list. If it is, we will add it to a new list that will hold the shared elements. Finally, we will return this new list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function similar_elements(list1, list2):
       create an empty list called shared_elements
       for each element in list1:
           if element is in list2:
               add element to shared_elements
       return shared_elements
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    # Create an empty list to hold the shared elements
    shared_elements = []
    
    # Iterate through each element in the first list
    for element in list1:
        # Check if the element is in the second list
        if element in list2:
            # If it is, add it to the shared_elements list
            shared_elements.append(element)
    
    # Return the list of shared elements
    return shared_elements

    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

    In tackling the problem of determining if three adjacent sides of a cube are painted the same color, my initial approach was logically sound and correctly identified the necessary combinations of sides to check. However, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient implementation.

    **Key Insights from the Official Solution:**
    1. **Use of Indexing**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides directly. This approach simplifies the checking process by avoiding multiple conditional statements and instead iterating through predefined combinations.
  
    2. **Set for Uniqueness**: The official solution leverages the `set` data structure to check if all three colors are the same. By converting the list of colors to a set, it effectively checks for uniqueness in a single line, which is both elegant and efficient.

    3. **Control Flow**: The use of a counter (`c`) to track whether a match was found is straightforward, but the official solution could be further simplified by directly printing "YES" or "NO" based on the condition without needing an additional variable.

    **Comparison with My Approach**:
    - My solution explicitly checked each combination with multiple `or` conditions, which, while clear, could be seen as verbose compared to the official solution's use of a loop over a predefined list of combinations.
    - The official solution's use of `set` for checking color equality is a more Pythonic approach, reducing the complexity of the condition checks.

    ### Conclusion
    The official solution is more efficient in terms of readability and maintainability. It highlights the importance of leveraging built-in data structures and concise control flow in Python. In future problems, I will aim to adopt similar strategies to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.

    Chapter: Data structures
    Section: Comparison to sorting
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Comparison to sorting}

    It is often possible to solve a problem
    using either data structures or sorting.
    Sometimes there are remarkable differences
    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,
    which may be hidden in their time complexities.

    Let us consider a problem where
    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$
    that both contain $n$ elements.
    Our task is to calculate the number of elements
    that belong to both of the lists.
    For example, for the lists
    \[A = [5,2,8,9] \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\]
    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5
    and 9 belong to both of the lists.

    A straightforward solution to the problem is
    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,
    but next we will focus on
    more efficient algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,
    and after this, we iterate through the elements
    of $B$ and check for each elements if it
    also belongs to $A$.
    This is efficient because the elements of $A$
    are in a set.
    Using the \texttt{set} structure,
    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,
    so instead of the \texttt{set} structure
    we can also use the \texttt{unordered\_set} structure.
    This is an easy way to make the algorithm
    more efficient, because we only have to change
    the underlying data structure.
    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.
    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.
    After this, we iterate through both the lists
    at the same time and find the common elements.
    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n)$,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    so the total time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    The following table shows how efficient
    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and
    the elements of the lists are random
    integers between $1 \ldots 10^9$:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\
    $2 \cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\
    $3 \cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\
    $4 \cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\
    $5 \cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that
    they use different set structures.
    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on
    the running time, because Algorithm 2
    is 4–5 times faster than Algorithm 1.

    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3
    which uses sorting.
    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.
    Interestingly, the time complexity of both
    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \log n)$,
    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.
    This can be explained by the fact that
    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done
    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.
    On the other hand,
    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree
    during the whole algorithm.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many rooms in two houses could be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where each box contained a number of tiles equal to its index. The challenge involved ensuring that tiles from a single box were used to tile two rooms, one in each house, and that the total area of the rooms matched the number of tiles.

    The core concept revolved around checking pairs of rooms to see if their combined area equaled the number of tiles in an even-indexed box. The solution involved iterating through all boxes and checking all possible pairs of rooms, which could be computationally expensive given the constraints (up to \(10^{12}\) for N). 

    The initial approach was to use nested loops to check each box and room combination, but this would not scale well for large values of N. However, the provided solution worked correctly for smaller inputs, as evidenced by passing the sample test case.

    In future implementations, a more efficient algorithm would be necessary to handle larger values of N, possibly by leveraging mathematical properties of perfect squares or optimizing the search for room pairs. The final code snippet that worked for the sample input is as follows:

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(N):
        total_rooms = 0
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                for j1 in range(1, N + 1):
                    for j2 in range(1, N + 1):
                        if j1 != j2 and j1 * j1 + j2 * j2 == i:
                            total_rooms += 2
                            break
        return total_rooms

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ``` 

    This summary highlights the problem-solving approach, the challenges faced, and the need for optimization in future attempts.
