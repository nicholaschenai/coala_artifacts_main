INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/131 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and reverses only the vowels in that string. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase). The letter 'y' is not considered a vowel for this task. If there are no vowels in the string, it should return the string unchanged.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify all the vowels in the input string and store them in a list.
   - Reverse the list of vowels.
   - Create a new string by replacing the vowels in the original string with the reversed vowels, while keeping the positions of the consonants unchanged.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function reverse_vowels(s):
       define a list of vowels
       create an empty list to hold the vowels found in the string
       iterate through the string:
           if the character is a vowel:
               add it to the list of found vowels
       reverse the list of found vowels
       create an empty list for the result
       set a vowel index to 0
       iterate through the string again:
           if the character is a vowel:
               add the next vowel from the reversed list to the result
           else:
               add the character as is to the result
       join the result list into a string and return it
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def reverse_vowels(s: str) -> str:
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"  # Define the vowels
    found_vowels = []  # List to store the vowels found in the string
    
    # Collect all vowels from the string
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels:
            found_vowels.append(char)
    
    # Reverse the list of found vowels
    found_vowels.reverse()
    
    result = []  # List to build the result string
    vowel_index = 0  # Index to track the position in the reversed vowels list
    
    # Build the result string
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels:
            result.append(found_vowels[vowel_index])  # Replace with reversed vowel
            vowel_index += 1  # Move to the next vowel in the reversed list
        else:
            result.append(char)  # Keep the consonant as is
    
    return ''.join(result)  # Join the list into a string and return

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The problem involved removing adjacent duplicate characters from a string based on a specified count `k`. The solution utilized a stack to efficiently manage character counts and removals. The core concept was to iterate through the string, pushing characters onto the stack while tracking their counts. When a character's count reached `k`, it was removed from the stack.

    The strategy of using a stack worked effectively, as it allowed for easy access to the last character and its count, facilitating quick updates and removals. The final string was constructed by joining the characters left in the stack, multiplied by their respective counts.

    The implemented solution was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without issues. The key takeaway is the utility of stacks in problems involving consecutive elements and counts, which can simplify the logic and improve efficiency. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
            stack = []
            for char in s:
                if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                    stack[-1][1] += 1
                    if stack[-1][1] == k:
                        stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append([char, 1])
            result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)
            return result
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/131 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and reverses only the vowels in that string. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase). The letter 'y' is not considered a vowel for this task. If there are no vowels in the string, it should remain unchanged.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:

   - Finally, join the list into a string and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```

       define vowels as a set containing 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (and their uppercase versions)
       create an empty list to hold the vowels found in the string
