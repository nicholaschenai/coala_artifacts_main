The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.\n\n    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of \"abacaba\". The logic needed to ensure that after placing \"abacaba\", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. Checking how many times \"abacaba\" already appeared in the string.\n    2. Attempting to place \"abacaba\" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.\n    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.\n    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.\n\n    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            n = case[0]\n            s = case[1]\n            modified_string = list(s)\n\n            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            placed = False\n            for i in range(n - 6):\n                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):\n                    temp_string = modified_string[:]\n                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)\n                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:\n                        modified_string = temp_string\n                        placed = True\n                        break\n\n            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            if final_count != 1:\n                print(\"No\")\n            else:\n                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)\n                print(\"Yes\")\n                print(\"\".join(modified_string))\n\n    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != \"abacaba\"[j]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            s[index + j] = \"abacaba\"[j]\n\n    def count_abacaba(s):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n            if \"\".join(s[i:i + 7]) == \"abacaba\":\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\n    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i] == '?':\n                s[i] = 'z'\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(input())\n        s = input().strip()\n        test_cases.append((n, s))\n\n    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved removing adjacent duplicate characters from a string based on a specified count `k`. The solution utilized a stack to efficiently manage character counts and removals. The core concept was to iterate through the string, pushing characters onto the stack while tracking their counts. When a character's count reached `k`, it was removed from the stack.\n\n    The strategy of using a stack worked effectively, as it allowed for easy access to the last character and its count, facilitating quick updates and removals. The final string was constructed by joining the characters left in the stack, multiplied by their respective counts.\n\n    The implemented solution was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without issues. The key takeaway is the utility of stacks in problems involving consecutive elements and counts, which can simplify the logic and improve efficiency. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n            stack = []\n            for char in s:\n                if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                    stack[-1][1] += 1\n                    if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                        stack.pop()\n                else:\n                    stack.append([char, 1])\n            result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)\n            return result\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring \"abc\" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of \"abc\" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of \"abc\". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
