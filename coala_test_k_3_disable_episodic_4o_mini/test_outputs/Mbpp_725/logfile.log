INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/725 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of all the substrings that are enclosed in double quotation marks (" "). For example, if the input string is `Cortex "A53" Based "multi" tasking "Processor"`, the output should be a list containing the strings `['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and look for the positions of the quotation marks. When we find a quotation mark, we can start collecting characters until we reach the next quotation mark. We will store these collected characters in a list. Finally, we will return this list as the output.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function extract_quotation(input_string):
       initialize an empty list to store results
       initialize a variable to track if we are inside quotes (set to False)
       initialize a variable to collect characters (set to an empty string)
       
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is a quotation mark:
               if we are inside quotes:
                   add the collected characters to the results list
                   reset the collected characters
                   set inside quotes to False
               else:
                   set inside quotes to True
           else if we are inside quotes:
               add the character to the collected characters
       
       return the results list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def extract_quotation(input_string: str) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store results
    results = []
    # Variable to track if we are inside quotes
    inside_quotes = False
    # Variable to collect characters
    current_string = ""
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        if char == '"':  # Check for quotation mark
            if inside_quotes:  # If we are already inside quotes
                results.append(current_string)  # Add collected string to results
                current_string = ""  # Reset the collected string
                inside_quotes = False  # We are now outside quotes
            else:  # If we are not inside quotes
                inside_quotes = True  # We are now inside quotes
        elif inside_quotes:  # If we are inside quotes
            current_string += char  # Collect characters
    
    return results  # Return the list of collected strings

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". Initially, I incorrectly checked for the substring "not" in the quotes, which led to misclassifications when "not" appeared as part of other words (e.g., "nothing"). 

    The key concept was to ensure that "not" was treated as a standalone word. The solution required splitting each quote into individual words and checking for the presence of "not" in that list. This approach effectively resolved the issue.

    The final working code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def classify_quotes():
        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(input())
    
        # Process each quote
        for _ in range(T):
            # Read the quote
            S = input()
        
            # Split the quote into words
            words = S.split()
        
            # Check if the word "not" is in the list of words
            if "not" in words:
                print("Real Fancy")  # Classify as Real Fancy
            else:
                print("regularly fancy")  # Classify as regularly fancy

    # Call the function to execute the solution
    classify_quotes()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and ensuring that checks for specific words are done correctly, especially in string manipulation tasks.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    In this experience, I learned the importance of checking for standalone words rather than just substrings when classifying text. My initial solution incorrectly identified quotes containing "not" as part of other words (like "nothing") as "Real Fancy". The official solution effectively addresses this by splitting the input string into a list of words and checking for the presence of "not" in that list.

    The official solution uses the `split()` method to break the quote into words, which is similar to my approach. However, it also utilizes a while loop to manage the number of test cases, which is a straightforward way to handle multiple inputs. This method ensures that each quote is processed correctly and efficiently.

    Key insights from the official solution:
    - Always ensure that checks for specific words account for word boundaries to avoid false positives.
    - Using a list to store words from the input string allows for easy membership testing with the `in` operator.
    - Managing multiple test cases can be done effectively with a loop that decrements a counter.

    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of careful string manipulation and the need to consider edge cases in text processing tasks.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.
