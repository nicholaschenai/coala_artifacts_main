However, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient implementation.\n\n    **Key Insights from the Official Solution:**\n    1. **Use of Indexing**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides directly. This approach simplifies the checking process by avoiding multiple conditional statements and instead iterating through predefined combinations.\n  \n    2. **Set for Uniqueness**: The official solution leverages the `set` data structure to check if all three colors are the same. By converting the list of colors to a set, it effectively checks for uniqueness in a single line, which is both elegant and efficient.\n\n    3. **Control Flow**: The use of a counter (`c`) to track whether a match was found is straightforward, but the official solution could be further simplified by directly printing \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on the condition without needing an additional variable.\n\n    **Comparison with My Approach**:\n    - My solution explicitly checked each combination with multiple `or` conditions, which, while clear, could be seen as verbose compared to the official solution's use of a loop over a predefined list of combinations.\n    - The official solution's use of `set` for checking color equality is a more Pythonic approach, reducing the complexity of the condition checks.\n\n    ### Conclusion\n    The official solution is more efficient in terms of readability and maintainability. It highlights the importance of leveraging built-in data structures and concise control flow in Python. In future problems, I will aim to adopt similar strategies to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine if three adjacent sides of a cube were painted the same color based on given test cases. The solution involved checking specific combinations of adjacent sides for color matches. \n\n    The core concept tested was understanding the spatial relationships of a cube's sides and efficiently checking for color equality among them. The eight combinations of adjacent sides were identified and checked using simple conditional statements.\n\n    The initial implementation was correct in logic but required clarity and adherence to the problem's constraints. The final solution efficiently processed each test case in constant time, leading to an overall complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases.\n\n    Key code snippet for checking adjacent sides:\n    ```python\n    if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # front, left, top\n        colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # front, right, top\n        colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # front, left, bottom\n        colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # front, right, bottom\n        colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # back, left, top\n        colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # back, right, top\n        colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # back, left, bottom\n        colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):    # back, right, bottom\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships in programming problems and the need for clear, efficient code.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.\n\n    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            if K == N:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
