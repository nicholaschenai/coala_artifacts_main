    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that checks whether all elements in a given tuple are of the same data type. If they are, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can take the following steps:\n   - First, we will check if the tuple is empty. If it is, we can return `True` since there are no elements to compare.\n   - Next, we will take the data type of the first element in the tuple as a reference.\n   - We will then iterate through the rest of the elements in the tuple and compare their data types to the reference type.\n   - If we find any element with a different data type, we will return `False`. If all elements match the reference type, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_type(tuple):\n       if tuple is empty:\n           return True\n       reference_type = type of the first element\n       for each element in tuple:\n           if type of element is not equal to reference_type:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_type(tup):\n    # Check if the tuple is empty\n    if not tup:\n        return True  # An empty tuple has no differing types\n    # Get the type of the first element\n    reference_type = type(tup[0])\n    # Iterate through the tuple to check types\n    for element in tup:\n        if type(element) is not reference_type:\n            return False  # Found a differing type\n    return True  # All elements are of the same type\n```",
