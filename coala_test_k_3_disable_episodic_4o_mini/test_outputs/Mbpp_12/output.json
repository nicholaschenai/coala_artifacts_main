    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) and sorts the rows of the matrix based on the sum of the elements in each row. The rows should be arranged in ascending order according to these sums.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of each row in the matrix. We can then pair each row with its corresponding sum. After that, we can sort these pairs based on the sums. Finally, we will extract the sorted rows from these pairs and return them as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sort_matrix(matrix):\n       create an empty list to hold row sums\n       for each row in matrix:\n           calculate the sum of the row\n           append the row and its sum as a tuple to the list\n       sort the list of tuples based on the sum\n       extract the sorted rows from the sorted list\n       return the sorted rows\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sort_matrix(matrix):\n    # Create a list to hold tuples of (row sum, row)\n    row_sums = []\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of each row and store it with the row\n    for row in matrix:\n        row_sum = sum(row)  # Calculate the sum of the current row\n        row_sums.append((row_sum, row))  # Append a tuple of (sum, row)\n    \n    # Sort the list of tuples based on the row sum\n    row_sums.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort by the first element of the tuple (the sum)\n    \n    # Extract the sorted rows from the sorted list of tuples\n    sorted_rows = [row for _, row in row_sums]  # Get only the rows, ignoring the sums\n    \n    return sorted_rows  # Return the sorted rows\n```",
