    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence. The sequence is defined such that each term is derived from the previous terms, specifically using the formula: T(n) = T(T(n-1)) + T(n-1) for n > 2, with base cases T(1) = 1 and T(2) = 1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence, we can use a list to store the computed values of the sequence. We will initialize the first two values and then iteratively compute the subsequent values using the defined formula. This approach allows us to build the sequence up to the nth term efficiently.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sequence(n):\n       if n == 1 or n == 2:\n           return 1\n       create a list `dp` of size n+1\n       set dp[1] = 1\n       set dp[2] = 1\n       for i from 3 to n:\n           dp[i] = dp[dp[i-1]] + dp[i-1]\n       return dp[n]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    # Base cases for the first two terms of the Newman-Conway sequence\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Create a list to store the sequence values\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[1] = 1  # T(1) = 1\n    dp[2] = 1  # T(2) = 1\n    \n    # Compute the sequence values from T(3) to T(n)\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[dp[i - 1]] + dp[i - 1]  # T(n) = T(T(n-1)) + T(n-1)\n    \n    # Return the nth term of the sequence\n    return dp[n]\n```",
