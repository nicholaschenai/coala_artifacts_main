    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many pairs of numbers in a given list have an XOR value that is odd. The function should take a list of integers and a specific integer as input and return the count of such pairs.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if the XOR of two numbers is odd, we need to understand the properties of XOR. The XOR of two numbers is odd if one number is even and the other is odd. Therefore, we can count the number of even and odd numbers in the list. The number of valid pairs can then be calculated by multiplying the count of even numbers by the count of odd numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):\n       count_even = 0\n       count_odd = 0\n       \n       for each number in arr:\n           if number is even:\n               increment count_even\n           else:\n               increment count_odd\n       \n       return count_even * count_odd\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_even_odd(arr):\n    count_even = 0\n    count_odd = 0\n    \n    # Count even and odd numbers in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        if number % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even\n            count_even += 1\n        else:  # The number is odd\n            count_odd += 1\n            \n    return count_even, count_odd\n\ndef find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):\n    # Get the counts of even and odd numbers\n    count_even, count_odd = count_even_odd(arr)\n    \n    # The number of pairs with odd XOR is the product of even and odd counts\n    return count_even * count_odd\n```",
