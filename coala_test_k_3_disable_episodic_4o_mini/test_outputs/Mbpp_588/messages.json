The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.\n\n    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. \n\n    Key code snippet for counting divisors:\n    ```python\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of finding the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in an array of integers, I utilized a dynamic programming approach. The key concept was to maintain a list of dictionaries (`dp`), where each dictionary at index `i` tracks the lengths of subsequences for each possible difference between elements up to that index. \n\n    The algorithm iterates through each element in the array and, for each pair of elements, calculates the difference. It updates the length of the arithmetic subsequence in the corresponding dictionary and keeps track of the maximum length found. This approach effectively captures the relationships between elements and their differences, allowing for efficient updates and retrievals.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def longestArithSeqLength(self, A: list[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(A)\n            if n < 2:\n                return n\n        \n            dp = [{} for _ in range(n)]\n            max_length = 0\n        \n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    diff = A[i] - A[j]\n                    if diff not in dp[i]:\n                        dp[i][diff] = 0\n                    dp[i][diff] = max(dp[i][diff], dp[j].get(diff, 0) + 1)\n                    max_length = max(max_length, dp[i][diff] + 1)\n        \n            return max_length\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving problems involving subsequences and highlighted the utility of using dictionaries for efficient lookups and updates.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to find the maximum profit from stock prices given over a series of days, allowing for at most two transactions. The core concept involved breaking down the problem into two parts: calculating the maximum profit from the first transaction and then the second transaction. This approach utilized dynamic programming to keep track of profits at each step.\n\n    The solution involved creating two arrays: `first_profit` to store the maximum profit achievable up to each day and `second_profit` to store the maximum profit achievable from each day onward. By iterating through the prices and updating these arrays, I was able to combine the results to find the overall maximum profit.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key strategies that worked well included maintaining a running minimum and maximum price to efficiently calculate profits without needing nested loops, which would have increased the time complexity. This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and leveraging dynamic programming techniques for optimization. \n\n    Here is the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(prices)\n            if n == 0:\n                return 0\n        \n            first_profit = [0] * n\n            min_price = prices[0]\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])\n                first_profit[i] = max(first_profit[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)\n        \n            second_profit = [0] * n\n            max_price = prices[-1]\n        \n            for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n                max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])\n                second_profit[i] = max(second_profit[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])\n        \n            max_profit = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                max_profit = max(max_profit, first_profit[i] + second_profit[i])\n        \n            return max_profit\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
