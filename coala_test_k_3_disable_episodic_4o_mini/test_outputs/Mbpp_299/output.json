    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a person's name and a score. The goal is to calculate the total score for each person and return the name of the person with the highest total score along with that score.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We will use a dictionary to keep track of the total scores for each person. As we iterate through the list of tuples, we will add the scores to the corresponding person's total in the dictionary. After processing all tuples, we will find the person with the maximum score and return their name along with the score.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_aggregate(tuples):\n       create an empty dictionary to hold scores\n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           extract name and score from the tuple\n           if name is not in the dictionary:\n               initialize name in dictionary with score\n           else:\n               add score to the existing score for that name\n       initialize max_name and max_score\n       for each name, score in the dictionary:\n           if score is greater than max_score:\n               update max_name and max_score\n       return (max_name, max_score)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_aggregate(tuples):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to hold scores\n    scores = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the input list\n    for name, score in tuples:\n        # If the name is not in the dictionary, initialize it with the score\n        if name not in scores:\n            scores[name] = score\n        else:\n            # If the name is already in the dictionary, add the score to the existing score\n            scores[name] += score\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum score and corresponding name\n    max_name = \"\"\n    max_score = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the dictionary to find the name with the maximum score\n    for name, score in scores.items():\n        if score > max_score:\n            max_name = name\n            max_score = score\n    \n    # Return the name with the maximum score and the score itself\n    return (max_name, max_score)\n```",
