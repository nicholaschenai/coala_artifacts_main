The key insight is the use of the `min` function to keep track of the lexicographically smallest string encountered during the iterations. This approach is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in string comparison capabilities.\n\n    One notable aspect of the official solution is its simplicity and clarity. It maintains a single variable `answer` initialized to the original string, which is updated whenever a smaller string is found. This avoids the need for an additional list to store results, making the code more concise.\n\n    In terms of performance, both the official solution and my approach have similar time complexity, as they both involve nested loops iterating through the string. However, the official solution is slightly more efficient in terms of space since it does not require an extra list to store intermediate results.\n\n    Overall, the official solution reinforces the importance of leveraging built-in functions for comparisons and maintaining clarity in variable usage. It serves as a reminder to focus on simplicity and efficiency in problem-solving.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution provides a concise and efficient approach to solving the problem. Here are the key insights and steps that can be distilled from it:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads all input at once, which can be more efficient than reading line by line, especially for larger inputs. It uses `map` to convert the input string of integers into a list of integers.\n\n    2. **Query Validation**: The solution maintains a string `VQ` that contains valid operation characters. This allows for a quick check to determine if the query is valid, returning \"!!!\" for any invalid operation.\n\n    3. **Update Operation**: For the update operation (`U`), the solution directly modifies the list at the specified index, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\n    4. **Range Queries**: For sum, maximum, and minimum operations, the solution uses Python's built-in functions (`sum`, `max`, `min`) to compute results over the specified range. This is efficient given the constraints.\n\n    5. **Second Maximum and Minimum**: The solution handles the second maximum and minimum by first creating a sorted list of unique values from the specified range. It checks the length of this list to determine if a second maximum or minimum exists, returning \"NA\" if not.\n\n    6. **Efficiency**: The use of built-in functions and the sorted set approach for second max/min ensures that the solution is both clear and efficient, handling the constraints well.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is effective in its simplicity and leverages Python's capabilities to handle the problem efficiently. It serves as a good reference for handling similar range query problems in the future.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
