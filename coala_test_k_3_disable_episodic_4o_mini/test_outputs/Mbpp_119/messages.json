The unique element is the one that appears only once.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   Since the array is sorted, we can use a binary search approach to efficiently find the unique element. We can compare elements in pairs. If we find that the first element of a pair is equal to the second, we move to the next pair. If they are not equal, we check if the index is even or odd to determine which half of the array to search next. This way, we can narrow down our search space until we find the unique element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function search(arr):\n       left = 0\n       right = length of arr - 1\n       \n       while left < right:\n           mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n           \n           if mid is even:\n               if arr[mid] == arr[mid + 1]:\n                   left = mid + 2\n               else:\n                   right = mid\n           else:\n               if arr[mid] == arr[mid - 1]:\n                   left = mid + 1\n               else:\n                   right = mid\n       \n       return arr[left]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef search(arr):\n    # Initialize left and right pointers\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr) - 1\n    \n    # Perform binary search\n    while left < right:\n        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # Find the middle index\n        \n        # Check if mid is even\n        if mid % 2 == 0:\n            # If the element at mid is equal to the next element\n            if arr[mid] == arr[mid + 1]:\n                left = mid + 2  # Move to the right half\n            else:\n                right = mid  # Move to the left half\n        else:\n            # If mid is odd\n            if arr[mid] == arr[mid - 1]:\n                left = mid + 1  # Move to the right half\n            else:\n                right = mid  # Move to the left half\n    \n    # When left meets right, we found the unique element\n    return arr[left]\n```"

The key insight was recognizing that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to the Pisano period. This allowed for efficient computation even for very large values of N (up to 10^18).\n\n    The solution was structured into three main functions: one to compute the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using the Pisano period, another to determine the last remaining number after the removal process, and a final function to handle input and output. The approach of reducing N by half in each iteration of the removal process was effective, as it directly correlated with the position in the last digits array.\n\n    The final implementation passed the provided test cases successfully, demonstrating that the strategy of leveraging the periodicity of Fibonacci last digits was both efficient and effective. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The solution is useful for similar problems involving sequences and periodicity. \n\n    Key code snippets:\n    ```python\n    def last_digit_fibonacci(n):\n        # Calculate the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using Pisano period\n        ...\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(n):\n        # Find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements\n        ...\n\n    def solve():\n        # Handle input and output\n        ...\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I implemented a solution to find the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concept involved identifying the rightmost ascent in the permutation, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.\n\n    The implementation followed a clear structure: a helper function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution successfully handled multiple permutations as specified in the problem statement.\n\n    One key takeaway is the importance of understanding the mechanics of generating permutations, particularly the lexicographic order. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. The code was tested against sample inputs, and it produced the expected outputs, confirming its correctness. \n\n    Here\u2019s the essential code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def next_permutation(arr):\n        i = len(arr) - 2\n        while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        if i == -1:\n            arr.reverse()\n            return arr\n        j = len(arr) - 1\n        while arr[j] <= arr[i]:\n            j -= 1\n        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n        arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])\n        return arr\n\n    def main():\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(K):\n            permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)\n            results.append(\" \".join(map(str, next_perm)))\n        print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the solution's structure, which can be useful for similar tasks in the future.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays containing exactly `k` odd numbers from a given list of integers. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving subarrays and counts.\n\n    The core concept involved maintaining a count of odd numbers within a window defined by two pointers (left and right). As the right pointer expanded the window, the odd count was updated. If the count exceeded `k`, the left pointer was incremented to reduce the count back to `k`. When the count matched `k`, the number of valid subarrays was calculated by counting the even numbers to the left of the current window.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the sliding window technique is suitable for this type of problem. The key takeaway is the importance of managing two pointers to dynamically adjust the window size while keeping track of specific conditions (in this case, the count of odd numbers). \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n            result = 0\n            left = 0\n            odd_count = 0\n        \n            for right in range(len(nums)):\n                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:\n                    odd_count += 1\n            \n                while odd_count > k:\n                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:\n                        odd_count -= 1\n                    left += 1\n            \n                if odd_count == k:\n                    temp_left = left\n                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:\n                        temp_left += 1\n                    result += (temp_left - left + 1)\n        \n            return result\n    ``` \n\n    This approach effectively counts the desired subarrays while maintaining a linear time complexity, making it suitable for larger input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
