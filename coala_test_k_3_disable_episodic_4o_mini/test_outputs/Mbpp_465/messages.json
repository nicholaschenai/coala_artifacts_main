Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.\n\n    2. **Data Structure**: It uses a dictionary (`scores`) to map the difficulty score (n) to a list of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping of problems with the same difficulty.\n\n    3. **Pairing and Sorting**: For each problem, the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask are paired using a dictionary. The scores are then sorted, which simplifies the comparison of contestant numbers.\n\n    4. **Counting Decreases**: The solution counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases as it moves through the sorted scores. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent elements.\n\n    5. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores for all problems, the solution sorts the unique difficulty scores and then sorts the problem indices for each score before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the required order.\n\n    6. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.\n\n    In contrast to my initial approach, the official solution is more concise and leverages Python's built-in data structures effectively. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly mapping scores to problem indices, which simplifies the sorting and output process. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can simplify grouping and sorting tasks in programming challenges.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the main challenge was to correctly handle team names that could be presented in any order due to character rearrangement. The goal was to accumulate scores for each team based on their submissions while ensuring that teams with the same character composition were treated as identical.\n\n    The initial approach involved using a normalized version of the team names (sorted characters) as keys in a dictionary to accumulate scores. However, this led to the loss of the original team names, which was crucial for the final output. The output format required the original team names to be printed alongside their scores, sorted by score and then lexicographically by name.\n\n    The solution was refined by storing tuples in the dictionary that included both the original team name and the accumulated score. This allowed for proper retrieval and sorting of results. The final implementation successfully passed all tests by ensuring that the output matched the expected format.\n\n    Key takeaways:\n    - Always retain necessary information (like original names) when normalizing data for processing.\n    - Sorting and output formatting are critical in competitive programming problems, especially when multiple criteria are involved. \n\n    Final working code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n            index += 1\n        \n            scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n            # Process first half hour submissions\n            for _ in range(R):\n                line = data[index].split()\n                team_name = line[0]\n                points = int(line[1])\n                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n                if normalized_name not in scores:\n                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)\n                index += 1\n        \n            # Process remaining submissions\n            for _ in range(N - R):\n                line = data[index].split()\n                team_name = line[0]\n                points = int(line[1])\n                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n                if normalized_name not in scores:\n                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)\n                index += 1\n        \n            # Prepare result for sorting\n            result = [(name, score) for normalized_name, (name, score) in scores.items()]\n            # Sort by score (descending) and then by team name (lexicographical)\n            result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n            # Print the results\n            for team_name, score in result:\n                print(team_name, score)\n\n    # Call the main function to execute the code\n    main()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring \"abc\" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of \"abc\" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of \"abc\". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
