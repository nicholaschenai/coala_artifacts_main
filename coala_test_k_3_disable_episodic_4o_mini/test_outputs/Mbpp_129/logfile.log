INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/129 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given square matrix (2D list) is a magic square. A magic square is a grid where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all the same.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if a matrix is a magic square, we will:
   - First, check if the matrix is square (the number of rows should equal the number of columns).
   - Calculate the sum of the first row, which will be our target sum.
   - Check if the sum of each row matches the target sum.
   - Check if the sum of each column matches the target sum.
   - Calculate the sums of the two main diagonals and check if they match the target sum.
   - If all these conditions are satisfied, the matrix is a magic square.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function magic_square_test(matrix):
       if matrix is not square:
           return False
       target_sum = sum of the first row
       for each row in matrix:
           if sum of row != target_sum:
               return False
       for each column in matrix:
           if sum of column != target_sum:
               return False
       diagonal1_sum = sum of the main diagonal
       diagonal2_sum = sum of the other diagonal
       if diagonal1_sum != target_sum or diagonal2_sum != target_sum:
           return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def magic_square_test(matrix):
    # Check if the matrix is square
    n = len(matrix)
    if any(len(row) != n for row in matrix):
        return False
    
    # Calculate the target sum from the first row
    target_sum = sum(matrix[0])
    
    # Check the sum of each row
    for row in matrix:
        if sum(row) != target_sum:
            return False
    
    # Check the sum of each column
    for col in range(n):
        if sum(matrix[row][col] for row in range(n)) != target_sum:
            return False
    
    # Check the sum of the main diagonal
    diagonal1_sum = sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(n))
    # Check the sum of the other diagonal
    diagonal2_sum = sum(matrix[i][n - 1 - i] for i in range(n))
    
    # Check if both diagonal sums match the target sum
    if diagonal1_sum != target_sum or diagonal2_sum != target_sum:
        return False
    
    # If all checks passed, it is a magic square
    return True

[Summary]:
    The problem involved determining if a grid arrangement of beds in a hospital was "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on the adjacency of beds represented by '1's in a square grid. The key concept was to check for adjacent '1's in the grid, while allowing diagonal placements to be safe.

    The solution was structured into two main functions: `is_safe_area` to check the grid for adjacent beds, and `solve` to handle input and output. The adjacency check involved iterating through each cell and checking its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) for '1's. If any adjacent '1's were found, the arrangement was marked as "UNSAFE".

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The core strategy of checking adjacent cells was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during the process. This experience reinforced the importance of careful adjacency checks in grid-based problems. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def is_safe_area(grid):
        N = len(grid)
        for row in range(N):
            for column in range(N):
                if grid[row][column] == 1:
                    if (row > 0 and grid[row-1][column] == 1) or \
                       (row < N-1 and grid[row+1][column] == 1) or \
                       (column > 0 and grid[row][column-1] == 1) or \
                       (column < N-1 and grid[row][column+1] == 1):
                        return "UNSAFE"
        return "SAFE"

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            grid = []
        
            for _ in range(N):
                row = list(map(int, data[index].split()))
                grid.append(row)
                index += 1
        
            result = is_safe_area(grid)
            results.append(result)

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining whether a set of matchsticks can form a square, I identified the key concepts of total length calculation and backtracking. The first step is to check if the total length of the matchsticks is divisible by 4, as this is a necessary condition for forming a square. If it is not, the function can immediately return false.

    The backtracking approach was effective in exploring combinations of matchsticks to build the four sides of the square. By sorting the matchsticks in descending order, I improved the efficiency of the backtracking process, as larger matchsticks are placed first, reducing the number of recursive calls needed.

    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach works well within the constraints given (length of matchstick array not exceeding 15). The code structure, with a helper function for backtracking, allowed for clear separation of logic and improved readability.

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    def backtrack(index):
        if index == len(nums):
            return all(side == side_length for side in sides)
        for i in range(4):
            if sides[i] + nums[index] <= side_length:
                sides[i] += nums[index]
                if backtrack(index + 1):
                    return True
                sides[i] -= nums[index]
            if sides[i] == 0:
                break
        return False
    ``` 

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of checking base conditions early and using backtracking for combinatorial problems.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a tennis tournament with \( N \) players could be structured such that each player wins the same number of matches. The key insight was recognizing that if \( N \) is even, it's impossible for all players to have the same number of wins, while if \( N \) is odd, a valid structure can be created.

    Initially, I incorrectly filled the win/loss matrix, leading to potential contradictions in match outcomes. The correct approach involved a circular win pattern where each player wins against the next player in line, ensuring that each player has exactly one win and one loss.

    The final solution effectively checks the parity of \( N \) and constructs the matrix accordingly. The code snippet below reflects the correct implementation:

    ```python
    def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
        for N in test_cases:
            if N % 2 == 0:  # Check if N is even
                print("NO")
            else:
                print("YES")
                matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
                for i in range(N):
                    matrix[i][(i + 1) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against the next player
                for row in matrix:
                    print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully constructing data structures to meet specific requirements and highlighted the need to validate logic against the problem constraints.

The first step is to check if the total length of the matchsticks is divisible by 4, as this is a necessary condition for forming a square. If it is not, the function can immediately return false.

    The backtracking approach was effective in exploring combinations of matchsticks to build the four sides of the square. By sorting the matchsticks in descending order, I improved the efficiency of the backtracking process, as larger matchsticks are placed first, reducing the number of recursive calls needed.

    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach works well within the constraints given (length of matchstick array not exceeding 15). The code structure, with a helper function for backtracking, allowed for clear separation of logic and improved readability.

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    def backtrack(index):
        if index == len(nums):
            return all(side == side_length for side in sides)
        for i in range(4):
            if sides[i] + nums[index] <= side_length:
                sides[i] += nums[index]
                if backtrack(index + 1):
                    return True
                sides[i] -= nums[index]
            if sides[i] == 0:
                break
        return False
    ``` 

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of checking base conditions early and using backtracking for combinatorial problems.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a tennis tournament with \( N \) players could be structured such that each player wins the same number of matches. The key insight was recognizing that if \( N \) is even, it's impossible for all players to have the same number of wins, while if \( N \) is odd, a valid structure can be created.

    Initially, I incorrectly filled the win/loss matrix, leading to potential contradictions in match outcomes. The correct approach involved a circular win pattern where each player wins against the next player in line, ensuring that each player has exactly one win and one loss.

    The final solution effectively checks the parity of \( N \) and constructs the matrix accordingly. The code snippet below reflects the correct implementation:

    ```python
    def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
        for N in test_cases:
            if N % 2 == 0:  # Check if N is even
                print("NO")
            else:
                print("YES")
                matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
                for i in range(N):
                    matrix[i][(i + 1) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against the next player
                for row in matrix:
                    print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully constructing data structures to meet specific requirements and highlighted the need to validate logic against the problem constraints.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/129 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to determine if a given square matrix is a magic square. A magic square is defined as a square grid where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all the same.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To check if a matrix is a magic square, we need to:
   - Calculate the sum of the first row to establish the target sum.
   - Check if all rows sum to this target.
   - Check if all columns sum to this target.
   - Check if both diagonals sum to this target.
   If all these conditions are met, the matrix is a magic square.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function magic_square(matrix):
       if matrix is empty:
           return False
       target_sum = sum of the first row
       for each row in matrix:
           if sum of row is not equal to target_sum:
               return False
       for each column in matrix:
           if sum of column is not equal to target_sum:
               return False
       diagonal1_sum = sum of the main diagonal
       diagonal2_sum = sum of the other diagonal
       if diagonal1_sum is not equal to target_sum or diagonal2_sum is not equal to target_sum:
           return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def magic_square(matrix):
    # Check if the matrix is empty
    if not matrix:
        return False
    
    # Calculate the target sum from the first row
    target_sum = sum(matrix[0])
    
    # Check if all rows sum to the target sum

    # Check if all columns sum to the target sum
    n = len(matrix)
    for col in range(n):
        column_sum = sum(matrix[row][col] for row in range(n))
        if column_sum != target_sum:

    # Check the sum of the main diagonal
    diagonal1_sum = sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(n))
    # Check the sum of the other diagonal
    diagonal2_sum = sum(matrix[i][n - 1 - i] for i in range(n))
    
    # Check if both diagonals sum to the target sum
    if diagonal1_sum != target_sum or diagonal2_sum != target_sum:
        return False
    
    # If all checks passed, it is a magic square
    return True
