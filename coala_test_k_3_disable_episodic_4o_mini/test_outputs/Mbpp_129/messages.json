The key concept was to check for adjacent '1's in the grid, while allowing diagonal placements to be safe.\n\n    The solution was structured into two main functions: `is_safe_area` to check the grid for adjacent beds, and `solve` to handle input and output. The adjacency check involved iterating through each cell and checking its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) for '1's. If any adjacent '1's were found, the arrangement was marked as \"UNSAFE\".\n\n    The implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The core strategy of checking adjacent cells was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during the process. This experience reinforced the importance of careful adjacency checks in grid-based problems. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_safe_area(grid):\n        N = len(grid)\n        for row in range(N):\n            for column in range(N):\n                if grid[row][column] == 1:\n                    if (row > 0 and grid[row-1][column] == 1) or \\\n                       (row < N-1 and grid[row+1][column] == 1) or \\\n                       (column > 0 and grid[row][column-1] == 1) or \\\n                       (column < N-1 and grid[row][column+1] == 1):\n                        return \"UNSAFE\"\n        return \"SAFE\"\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            grid = []\n        \n            for _ in range(N):\n                row = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n                grid.append(row)\n                index += 1\n        \n            result = is_safe_area(grid)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of determining whether a set of matchsticks can form a square, I identified the key concepts of total length calculation and backtracking. The first step is to check if the total length of the matchsticks is divisible by 4, as this is a necessary condition for forming a square. If it is not, the function can immediately return false.\n\n    The backtracking approach was effective in exploring combinations of matchsticks to build the four sides of the square. By sorting the matchsticks in descending order, I improved the efficiency of the backtracking process, as larger matchsticks are placed first, reducing the number of recursive calls needed.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach works well within the constraints given (length of matchstick array not exceeding 15). The code structure, with a helper function for backtracking, allowed for clear separation of logic and improved readability.\n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def backtrack(index):\n        if index == len(nums):\n            return all(side == side_length for side in sides)\n        for i in range(4):\n            if sides[i] + nums[index] <= side_length:\n                sides[i] += nums[index]\n                if backtrack(index + 1):\n                    return True\n                sides[i] -= nums[index]\n            if sides[i] == 0:\n                break\n        return False\n    ``` \n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of checking base conditions early and using backtracking for combinatorial problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a tennis tournament with \\( N \\) players could be structured such that each player wins the same number of matches. The key insight was recognizing that if \\( N \\) is even, it's impossible for all players to have the same number of wins, while if \\( N \\) is odd, a valid structure can be created.\n\n    Initially, I incorrectly filled the win/loss matrix, leading to potential contradictions in match outcomes. The correct approach involved a circular win pattern where each player wins against the next player in line, ensuring that each player has exactly one win and one loss.\n\n    The final solution effectively checks the parity of \\( N \\) and constructs the matrix accordingly. The code snippet below reflects the correct implementation:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):\n        for N in test_cases:\n            if N % 2 == 0:  # Check if N is even\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]\n                for i in range(N):\n                    matrix[i][(i + 1) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against the next player\n                for row in matrix:\n                    print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully constructing data structures to meet specific requirements and highlighted the need to validate logic against the problem constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
