INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/606 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that converts an angle given in degrees to its equivalent in radians. The function should take a single input (the angle in degrees) and return the angle in radians.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert degrees to radians, we can use the mathematical relationship that Ï€ radians is equal to 180 degrees. Therefore, to convert degrees to radians, we can multiply the degree value by Ï€ and then divide by 180. We can use the built-in constant `math.pi` for the value of Ï€.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION radian_degree(degrees):
       SET pi = 3.141592653589793
       SET radians = (degrees * pi) / 180
       RETURN radians
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def radian_degree(degrees):
    # Define the value of pi
    pi = 3.141592653589793
    # Convert degrees to radians using the formula
    radians = (degrees * pi) / 180
    # Return the calculated radians
    return radians

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to create a function that converts a number to a specified base, including handling both integer and fractional parts. The function needed to support bases from 2 to 36 and format the output correctly as a string.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Base Conversion**: The core concept involved repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders to form the digits in the new base.
    - **Handling Decimals**: For fractional parts, the approach involved multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting the integer part as the next digit.

    ### Issues Encountered:
    1. **Integer Conversion Logic**: The initial implementation failed to correctly convert integers to the specified base, leading to incorrect outputs for several test cases. The remainders were not being calculated or collected properly.
    2. **Fractional Part Handling**: The logic for converting the fractional part was also flawed, resulting in incorrect decimal outputs.
    3. **Output Formatting**: The formatting for zero and decimal places was incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

    ### Strategies That Worked:
    - The use of lists to collect digits and then reversing them for the final output was a good approach, but it needed to be applied correctly.
    - Ensuring that the function could handle negative numbers and zero was crucial for comprehensive functionality.

    ### Code Snippet:
    Hereâ€™s the final version of the function that was intended to address the issues:

    ```python
    def converter(n, decimals=0, base=3.141592653589793):
        if n == 0:
            return "0" + (".0" * decimals if decimals > 0 else "")
    
        if n < 0:
            sign = "-"
            n = -n
        else:
            sign = ""
    
        integer_part = int(n)
        fractional_part = n - integer_part
    
        digits = []
        while integer_part > 0:
            remainder = int(integer_part % base)
            if remainder >= 10:
                digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('A')))
            else:
                digits.append(str(remainder))
            integer_part = int(integer_part // base)
    
        integer_result = ''.join(reversed(digits)) if digits else "0"
    
        if decimals > 0:
            fractional_digits = []
            while decimals > 0:
                fractional_part *= base
                fractional_digit = int(fractional_part)
                if fractional_digit >= 10:
                    fractional_digits.append(chr(fractional_digit - 10 + ord('A')))
                else:
                    fractional_digits.append(str(fractional_digit))
                fractional_part -= fractional_digit
                decimals -= 1
        
            fractional_result = ''.join(fractional_digits)
            return sign + integer_result + "." + fractional_result
    
        return sign + integer_result
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    The experience highlighted the importance of carefully implementing base conversion logic and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts are handled correctly. Future attempts should focus on validating the conversion process with a wider range of test cases to ensure robustness.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine if a right-angled triangle could be formed with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). The solution involved using the properties of right triangles, specifically the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. 

    The approach was to derive a quadratic equation based on the relationship between the sides and the area, and then solve for the lengths of the legs of the triangle. The discriminant of the quadratic equation was crucial in determining whether valid triangle sides could be found. If the discriminant was negative, it indicated that no valid triangle could be formed.

    The final implementation successfully handled multiple test cases and formatted the output correctly. Key points included ensuring that the sides were sorted and that the output precision met the requirements. The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.

    Hereâ€™s the core function used to find the triangle:

    ```python
    def find_triangle(H, S):
        area_double = 2 * S
        discriminant = H**4 - 4 * (area_double**2)
    
        if discriminant < 0:
            return -1
    
        a1 = ((H**2 + discriminant**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        a2 = ((H**2 - discriminant**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5
        b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5
    
        sides1 = sorted([a1, b1, H])
        sides2 = sorted([a2, b2, H])
    
        if sides1[0] > 0 and sides1[1] > 0:
            return sides1
        if sides2[0] > 0 and sides2[1] > 0:
            return sides2
    
        return -1
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric properties and their mathematical implications in programming challenges.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
