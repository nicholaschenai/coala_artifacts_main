The solution involved iterating through all possible contiguous subsequences to remove and checking if the remaining sequence met the strictly increasing condition.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate and evaluate subsequences efficiently. The approach involved two nested loops to consider all possible starting and ending indices for the subsequence to be removed. After forming the remaining sequence, a helper function was used to check if it was strictly increasing.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was straightforward. The helper function `is_strictly_increasing` was crucial for validating the remaining sequence. The solution was efficient enough given the constraints, but it could be optimized further for larger inputs by avoiding the creation of new lists for the remaining sequence.\n\n    Here\u2019s the key code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_strictly_increasing(sequence):\n        for i in range(1, len(sequence)):\n            if sequence[i] <= sequence[i - 1]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def count_ways_to_remove_subsequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n            count = 0\n        \n            for start in range(N):\n                for end in range(start, N):\n                    remaining_sequence = A[0:start] + A[end + 1:N]\n                    if remaining_sequence and is_strictly_increasing(remaining_sequence):\n                        count += 1\n        \n            print(count)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding subsequences and their properties, as well as the need for efficient checks when dealing with potentially large datasets.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring \"abacaba\" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.\n\n    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of \"abacaba\". The logic needed to ensure that after placing \"abacaba\", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. Checking how many times \"abacaba\" already appeared in the string.\n    2. Attempting to place \"abacaba\" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.\n    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.\n    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.\n\n    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            n = case[0]\n            s = case[1]\n            modified_string = list(s)\n\n            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            placed = False\n            for i in range(n - 6):\n                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):\n                    temp_string = modified_string[:]\n                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)\n                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:\n                        modified_string = temp_string\n                        placed = True\n                        break\n\n            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            if final_count != 1:\n                print(\"No\")\n            else:\n                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)\n                print(\"Yes\")\n                print(\"\".join(modified_string))\n\n    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != \"abacaba\"[j]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            s[index + j] = \"abacaba\"[j]\n\n    def count_abacaba(s):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n            if \"\".join(s[i:i + 7]) == \"abacaba\":\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\n    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i] == '?':\n                s[i] = 'z'\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(input())\n        s = input().strip()\n        test_cases.append((n, s))\n\n    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring \"abc\" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of \"abc\" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of \"abc\". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
