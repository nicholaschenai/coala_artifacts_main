    "raw_msg": "Given the previous analysis and the insights from the memories, it seems that the calculation of the directrix was not correctly aligned with the expected output. \n\nTo ensure that we derive the correct directrix for the parabola defined by the equation \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the vertex**:\n   - The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n   - The y-coordinate of the vertex can be calculated by substituting this x-coordinate back into the parabola equation.\n\n2. **Calculate \\( p \\)**:\n   - The distance \\( p \\) from the vertex to the focus is given by \\( p = \\frac{1}{4a} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the directrix**:\n   - The directrix is given by the formula \\( y = k - p \\), where \\( k \\) is the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\n4. **Return the directrix as an integer**.\n\nNow, let's implement this in the code, ensuring that we correctly calculate the vertex and the directrix:\n\n```python\ndef parabola_directrix(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the vertex x-coordinate\n    vertex_x = -b / (2 * a)\n    \n    # Calculate the vertex y-coordinate\n    vertex_y = a * vertex_x**2 + b * vertex_x + c\n    \n    # Calculate the distance p from the vertex to the focus\n    p = 1 / (4 * a)\n    \n    # Calculate the directrix using the correct formula\n    directrix = vertex_y - p\n    \n    # Return the directrix as an integer\n    return int(directrix)\n\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly compute the directrix of the parabola given the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). The calculations have been carefully structured to ensure accuracy.",
