    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the implementation of the function to accurately calculate the directrix of a parabola. The key points to address are:\n\n1. **Correctly calculate the vertex**: The vertex coordinates need to be calculated properly.\n2. **Use the correct formula for the directrix**: The directrix should be calculated as \\( k - \\frac{1}{4a} \\), where \\( k \\) is the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef parabola_directrix(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the vertex x-coordinate\n    vertex_x = -b / (2 * a)\n    \n    # Calculate the vertex y-coordinate\n    vertex_y = a * vertex_x**2 + b * vertex_x + c\n    \n    # Calculate the distance p from the vertex to the focus\n    p = 1 / (4 * a)\n    \n    # Calculate the directrix using the correct formula\n    directrix = vertex_y - p\n    \n    # Return the directrix as an integer\n    return int(directrix)\n\n``` \n\nThis implementation should now correctly compute the directrix of the parabola given the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).",
