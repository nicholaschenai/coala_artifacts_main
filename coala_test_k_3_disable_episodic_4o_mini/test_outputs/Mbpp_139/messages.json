Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).\n\n    ## Solution\n\n    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).\n\n    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:\n\n    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$\n\n    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$\n\n    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:\n\n    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$\n\n    $$x \\cdot (-2x_2) + y \\cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$\n\n    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:\n\n    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    A &= -2x_2 \\\\\n    B &= -2y_2 \\\\\n    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).\n\n    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Circle-Line Intersection\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Circle-Line Intersection\n\n    Given the coordinates of the center of a circle and its radius, and the equation of a line, you're required to find the points of intersection.\n\n    ## Solution\n\n    Instead of solving the system of two equations, we will approach the problem geometrically. This way we get a more accurate solution from the point of view of numerical stability.\n\n    We assume without loss of generality that the circle is centered at the origin. If it's not, we translate it there and correct the $C$ constant in the line equation. So we have a circle centered at $(0,0)$ of radius $r$ and a line with equation $Ax+By+C=0$.\n\n    Let's start by find the point on the line which is closest to the origin $(x_0, y_0)$. First, it has to be at a distance\n\n    $$ d_0 = \\frac{|C|}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}} $$\n\n    Second, since the vector $(A, B)$ is perpendicular to the line, the coordinates of the point must be proportional to the coordinates of this vector. Since we know the distance of the point to the origin, we just need to scale the vector $(A, B)$ to this length, and we'll get:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    x_0 &= - \\frac{AC}{A^2 + B^2} \\\\\n    y_0 &= - \\frac{BC}{A^2 + B^2} \n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    The minus signs are not obvious, but they can be easily verified by substituting $x_0$ and $y_0$ in the equation of the line.\n\n    At this stage we can determine the number of intersection points, and even find the solution when there is one or zero points. Indeed, if the distance from $(x_0, y_0)$ to the origin $d_0$ is greater than the radius $r$, the answer is **zero points**. If $d_0=r$, the answer is **one point** $(x_0, y_0)$. If $d_0<r$, there are two points of intersection, and now we have to find their coordinates.\n\n    So, we know that the point $(x_0, y_0)$ is inside the circle. The two points of intersection, $(a_x, a_y)$ and $(b_x, b_y)$, must belong to the line $Ax+By+C=0$ and must be at the same distance $d$ from $(x_0, y_0)$, and this distance is easy to find:\n\n    $$ d = \\sqrt{r^2 - \\frac{C^2}{A^2 + B^2}} $$\n\n    Note that the vector $(-B, A)$ is collinear to the line, and thus we can find the points in question by adding and subtracting  vector $(-B,A)$, scaled to the length $d$, to the point $(x_0, y_0)$. \n\n    Finally, the equations of the two points of intersection are:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    m &= \\sqrt{\\frac{d^2}{A^2 + B^2}} \\\\\n    a_x &= x_0 + B \\cdot m, a_y = y_0 - A \\cdot m \\\\\n    b_x &= x_0 - B \\cdot m, b_y = y_0 + A \\cdot m\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    Had we solved the original system of equations using algebraic methods, we would likely get an answer in a different form with a larger error. The geometric method described here is more graphic and more accurate.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    As indicated at the outset, we assume that the circle is centered at the origin, and therefore the input to the program is the radius $r$ of the circle and the parameters $A$, $B$ and $C$ of the equation of the line.\n\n    ```cpp\n    double r, a, b, c; // given as input\n    double x0 = -a*c/(a*a+b*b), y0 = -b*c/(a*a+b*b);\n    if (c*c > r*r*(a*a+b*b)+EPS)\n        puts (\"no points\");\n    else if (abs (c*c - r*r*(a*a+b*b)) < EPS) {\n        puts (\"1 point\");\n        cout << x0 << ' ' << y0 << '\\n';\n    }\n    else {\n        double d = r*r - c*c/(a*a+b*b);\n        double mult = sqrt (d / (a*a+b*b));\n        double ax, ay, bx, by;\n        ax = x0 + b * mult;\n        bx = x0 - b * mult;\n        ay = y0 - a * mult;\n        by = y0 + a * mult;\n        puts (\"2 points\");\n        cout << ax << ' ' << ay << '\\n' << bx << ' ' << by << '\\n';\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine if a right-angled triangle could be formed with a given hypotenuse \\( H \\) and area \\( S \\). The solution involved using the properties of right triangles, specifically the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. \n\n    The approach was to derive a quadratic equation based on the relationship between the sides and the area, and then solve for the lengths of the legs of the triangle. The discriminant of the quadratic equation was crucial in determining whether valid triangle sides could be found. If the discriminant was negative, it indicated that no valid triangle could be formed.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled multiple test cases and formatted the output correctly. Key points included ensuring that the sides were sorted and that the output precision met the requirements. The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.\n\n    Here\u2019s the core function used to find the triangle:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_triangle(H, S):\n        area_double = 2 * S\n        discriminant = H**4 - 4 * (area_double**2)\n    \n        if discriminant < 0:\n            return -1\n    \n        a1 = ((H**2 + discriminant**0.5) / 2)**0.5\n        a2 = ((H**2 - discriminant**0.5) / 2)**0.5\n        b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5\n        b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5\n    \n        sides1 = sorted([a1, b1, H])\n        sides2 = sorted([a2, b2, H])\n    \n        if sides1[0] > 0 and sides1[1] > 0:\n            return sides1\n        if sides2[0] > 0 and sides2[1] > 0:\n            return sides2\n    \n        return -1\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric properties and their mathematical implications in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
