    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will now correct the solution to ensure that punctuation is properly handled when identifying adverbs. The updated code will strip punctuation from each word before checking if it ends with \"ly\". Here is the corrected implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Importing string to use for punctuation removal\n    import string\n    \n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Initialize the starting index\n    current_index = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each word to find the first adverb\n    for word in words:\n        # Strip punctuation from the word\n        stripped_word = word.strip(string.punctuation)\n        \n        # Check if the stripped word ends with \"ly\"\n        if stripped_word.endswith(\"ly\"):\n            # Calculate the starting index of the word\n            start_index = current_index\n            # Calculate the ending index of the word\n            end_index = start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1\n            # Return the indices and the stripped word\n            return (start_index, end_index, stripped_word)\n        \n        # Update the current index for the next word\n        current_index += len(word) + 1  # +1 for the space between words\n    \n    # If no adverb is found, return None (or suitable indication)\n    return None\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly identify the first adverb in a sentence, accounting for punctuation.",
