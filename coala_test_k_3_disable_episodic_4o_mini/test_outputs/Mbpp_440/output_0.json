    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that identifies the first adverb in a given sentence and returns its position (index) along with the adverb itself. An adverb is defined as a word that typically modifies a verb, adjective, or other adverbs, and in this case, we will consider any word that ends with \"ly\" as an adverb.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Split the input sentence into individual words.\n   - Iterate through the list of words to find the first word that ends with \"ly\".\n   - If such a word is found, we will return its starting index in the sentence, the ending index, and the word itself. If no adverb is found, we will return a suitable indication (though the problem does not specify what to return in this case).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_adverb_position(sentence):\n       split the sentence into words\n       for each word in words:\n           if the word ends with \"ly\":\n               calculate the starting index of the word in the sentence\n               calculate the ending index of the word in the sentence\n               return (starting index, ending index, word)\n       return None (or suitable indication if no adverb is found)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Initialize the starting index\n    current_index = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each word to find the first adverb\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word ends with \"ly\"\n        if word.endswith(\"ly\"):\n            # Calculate the starting index of the word\n            start_index = current_index\n            # Calculate the ending index of the word\n            end_index = start_index + len(word) - 1\n            # Return the indices and the word\n            return (start_index, end_index, word)\n        \n        # Update the current index for the next word\n        current_index += len(word) + 1  # +1 for the space between words\n    \n    # If no adverb is found, return None (or suitable indication)\n    return None\n\n# The function is now ready to be called with a sentence to find the first adverb and its position.\n```",
