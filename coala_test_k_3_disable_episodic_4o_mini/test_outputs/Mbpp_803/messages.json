        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that determines if a given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares because they are 1\u00b2, 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2, and 4\u00b2 respectively. The function should return `True` if the number is a perfect square and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To check if a number is a perfect square, we can take the integer square root of the number and then square that result. If squaring the integer square root gives us back the original number, then it is a perfect square. If not, it is not a perfect square.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `is_perfect_square` that takes an integer `n`.\n   - If `n` is less than 0, return `False` (since negative numbers cannot be perfect squares).\n   - Calculate the integer square root of `n` (let's call it `root`).\n   - If `root * root` equals `n`, return `True`.\n   - Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is negative\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Calculate the integer square root\n    root = int(n**0.5)\n    \n    # Check if squaring the root gives the original number\n    return root * root == n\n```"

The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution provides a much more efficient approach to the problem than my initial attempt. The key insight is recognizing that the number of rooms that can be tiled completely is directly related to the largest perfect square that can be formed with the tiles available. \n\n    ### Key Steps in the Official Solution:\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads multiple test cases efficiently using `stdin`.\n    2. **Dividing by 2**: The number of tiles in each box is halved (`n //= 2`) because each box can only tile two rooms.\n    3. **Calculating Perfect Squares**: The maximum number of rooms that can be tiled is determined by calculating `2 * int(n**0.5)`, which gives the count of rooms that can be tiled using the largest perfect square less than or equal to `n`.\n\n    ### Insights:\n    - My initial approach involved iterating through all possible room pairs, which is computationally expensive and inefficient, especially given the constraints (up to \\(10^{12}\\)).\n    - The official solution leverages mathematical properties of perfect squares and the relationship between the number of tiles and room areas, leading to a constant time complexity for each test case after the initial input read.\n    - This experience highlights the importance of recognizing patterns and mathematical relationships in problems, which can significantly simplify the solution and improve performance. \n\n    In future problems, I should consider looking for mathematical shortcuts or properties that can reduce the complexity of the solution rather than relying solely on brute force methods.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involves reducing a positive integer `n` to `1` using a minimum number of operations, where the operations depend on whether `n` is even or odd. The core concepts tested here include recursion and decision-making based on the parity of the number. \n\n    The solution was implemented using a recursive approach, where the function checks if `n` is even or odd. If even, it divides `n` by `2` and counts that as one operation. If odd, it explores both options (adding or subtracting `1`) and takes the minimum of the two results. This approach effectively captures the necessary operations to reach `1`.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the recursive strategy is effective for this problem. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution was efficient for the given constraints. The recursive nature of the solution allows for clear logic flow, although it could be optimized further using memoization to avoid redundant calculations in larger inputs. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            if n == 1:\n                return 0\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                return 1 + self.integerReplacement(n // 2)\n            else:\n                return 1 + min(self.integerReplacement(n + 1), self.integerReplacement(n - 1))\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
