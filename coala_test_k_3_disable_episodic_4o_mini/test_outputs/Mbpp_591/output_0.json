    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of elements and swaps the first and last elements of that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to check if the list has at least two elements. If it does, we will store the first element and the last element, then replace the first element with the last element and vice versa. If the list has fewer than two elements, we will return it as is since there are no elements to swap.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function swap_List(lst):\n       if length of lst is less than 2:\n           return lst\n       store first element in a variable first\n       store last element in a variable last\n       set first element of lst to last\n       set last element of lst to first\n       return lst\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef swap_List(lst):\n    # Check if the list has less than two elements\n    if len(lst) < 2:\n        return lst  # Return the list as is if no swap is needed\n    \n    # Store the first and last elements\n    first = lst[0]\n    last = lst[-1]\n    \n    # Swap the first and last elements\n    lst[0] = last\n    lst[-1] = first\n    \n    # Return the modified list\n    return lst\n```",
