2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/591 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of elements and swaps the first and last elements of that list. 

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will check if the list has at least two elements (since we cannot swap if there is only one or no elements). If it does, we will store the first element, replace the first element with the last element, and then replace the last element with the stored first element. Finally, we will return the modified list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function swap_List(input_list):
       if length of input_list is less than 2:
           return input_list
       store first_element as input_list[0]
       set input_list[0] to input_list[-1]  // last element
       set input_list[-1] to first_element
       return input_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def swap_List(input_list):
    # Check if the list has less than 2 elements
    if len(input_list) < 2:
        return input_list  # No swap needed, return the original list
    
    # Store the first element
    first_element = input_list[0]
    # Swap the first element with the last element
    input_list[0] = input_list[-1]  # Set first element to last element
    input_list[-1] = first_element  # Set last element to the stored first element
    
    return input_list  # Return the modified list

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I implemented a solution to find the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concept involved identifying the rightmost ascent in the permutation, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.

    The implementation followed a clear structure: a helper function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution successfully handled multiple permutations as specified in the problem statement.

    One key takeaway is the importance of understanding the mechanics of generating permutations, particularly the lexicographic order. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. The code was tested against sample inputs, and it produced the expected outputs, confirming its correctness. 

    Here’s the essential code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def next_permutation(arr):
        i = len(arr) - 2
        while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:
            i -= 1
        if i == -1:
            arr.reverse()
            return arr
        j = len(arr) - 1
        while arr[j] <= arr[i]:
            j -= 1
        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])
        return arr

    def main():
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        results = []
        for _ in range(K):
            permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))
            next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, next_perm)))
        print("\n".join(results))

    main()
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the solution's structure, which can be useful for similar tasks in the future.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. 

    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach of generating all possible strings by removing and reinserting characters was effective, and the use of comparisons to track the smallest string worked as intended.

    The final implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each string, and outputting the results. The code was structured to first define the main function and then handle input/output, ensuring clarity and separation of logic. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. 

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    for i in range(N):  # Iterate through each character
        char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to move
        remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remove the character
        for j in range(N):  # Try to insert the character at every position
            new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]
            if new_string < smallest_string:  # Check if the new string is smaller
                smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of string manipulation techniques and careful iteration when solving combinatorial problems.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next lexicographic permutation of a sequence. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:

    1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This is a good practice for competitive programming as it simplifies the main logic and improves readability.

    2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`. This is crucial because it identifies the point where the order can be changed to create the next permutation.

    3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible permutation that is larger than the current one.

    4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After swapping the pivot with the identified successor, the solution sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This step is efficient because it guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.

    5. **Output**: The results are printed in a single line using unpacking, which is a concise way to format the output.

    Overall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a clear understanding of the permutation generation process. My initial approach was similar but could have benefited from a more structured input handling and clearer separation of the steps involved in finding the next permutation. The official solution's use of sorting the suffix after the swap is a particularly effective way to ensure correctness without additional complexity.
