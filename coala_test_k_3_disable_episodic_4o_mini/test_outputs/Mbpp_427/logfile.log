INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/427 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a date in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" and converts it to the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert the date format, we can split the input string by the hyphen ("-") to separate the year, month, and day. After splitting, we can rearrange these components to form the new date format and then join them back together with hyphens.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `change_date_format` that takes a string input `date_str`.
   - Split `date_str` using the hyphen to get a list of components (year, month, day).
   - Rearrange the components to form a new list in the order of day, month, year.
   - Join the new list into a string with hyphens.
   - Return the newly formatted date string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def change_date_format(date_str: str) -> str:
    # Split the input date string by the hyphen
    components = date_str.split('-')
    
    # Rearrange the components to the new format (day-month-year)
    new_format = [components[2], components[1], components[0]]
    
    # Join the new format components with hyphens
    formatted_date = '-'.join(new_format)
    
    # Return the newly formatted date string
    return formatted_date

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to create a function that converts a number to a specified base, including handling both integer and fractional parts. The function needed to support bases from 2 to 36 and format the output correctly as a string.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Base Conversion**: The core concept involved repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders to form the digits in the new base.
    - **Handling Decimals**: For fractional parts, the approach involved multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting the integer part as the next digit.

    ### Issues Encountered:
    1. **Integer Conversion Logic**: The initial implementation failed to correctly convert integers to the specified base, leading to incorrect outputs for several test cases. The remainders were not being calculated or collected properly.
    2. **Fractional Part Handling**: The logic for converting the fractional part was also flawed, resulting in incorrect decimal outputs.
    3. **Output Formatting**: The formatting for zero and decimal places was incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

    ### Strategies That Worked:
    - The use of lists to collect digits and then reversing them for the final output was a good approach, but it needed to be applied correctly.
    - Ensuring that the function could handle negative numbers and zero was crucial for comprehensive functionality.

    ### Code Snippet:
    Here’s the final version of the function that was intended to address the issues:

    ```python
    def converter(n, decimals=0, base=3.141592653589793):
        if n == 0:
            return "0" + (".0" * decimals if decimals > 0 else "")
    
        if n < 0:
            sign = "-"
            n = -n
        else:
            sign = ""
    
        integer_part = int(n)
        fractional_part = n - integer_part
    
        digits = []
        while integer_part > 0:
            remainder = int(integer_part % base)
            if remainder >= 10:
                digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('A')))
            else:
                digits.append(str(remainder))
            integer_part = int(integer_part // base)
    
        integer_result = ''.join(reversed(digits)) if digits else "0"
    
        if decimals > 0:
            fractional_digits = []
            while decimals > 0:
                fractional_part *= base
                fractional_digit = int(fractional_part)
                if fractional_digit >= 10:
                    fractional_digits.append(chr(fractional_digit - 10 + ord('A')))
                else:
                    fractional_digits.append(str(fractional_digit))
                fractional_part -= fractional_digit
                decimals -= 1
        
            fractional_result = ''.join(fractional_digits)
            return sign + integer_result + "." + fractional_result
    
        return sign + integer_result
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    The experience highlighted the importance of carefully implementing base conversion logic and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts are handled correctly. Future attempts should focus on validating the conversion process with a wider range of test cases to ensure robustness.
[/Summary]

    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

    The official solution provided a more efficient and concise approach to converting a number to a specified base, particularly with the handling of both integer and fractional parts. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

    1. **Use of Mathematical Functions**: The official solution utilizes the `log` function to determine the maximum power of the base that fits into the number. This is a more efficient way to handle the conversion compared to repeatedly dividing the number.

    2. **Handling of Digits**: The solution uses a predefined string `DIGS` to map numeric values to their corresponding characters for bases greater than 10. This simplifies the conversion process and avoids the need for conditional checks during digit conversion.

    3. **Efficient Looping**: The loop iterates over a range that includes both the fractional and integer parts, allowing for a single pass to build the result string. This contrasts with my approach, which separated the integer and fractional conversions into different sections.

    4. **Negative Numbers**: The solution handles negative numbers by prepending a '-' sign based on the condition of `n`, which is a clean and effective way to manage the sign.

    5. **Output Formatting**: The official solution constructs the output string in a single list and joins it at the end, which is generally more efficient than concatenating strings directly.

    ### Key Takeaways
    - Using mathematical properties (like logarithms) can simplify the problem and improve performance.
    - Predefined mappings for digits can streamline the conversion process.
    - Combining the handling of integer and fractional parts into a single loop can reduce complexity and improve readability.
    - Efficient string construction techniques (like using lists) can enhance performance in Python.

    Overall, the official solution is more elegant and efficient than my initial attempts, highlighting the importance of leveraging mathematical insights and efficient data structures in programming challenges.
