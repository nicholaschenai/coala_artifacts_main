    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find the position in a sorted list where a given value can be inserted while maintaining the order of the list. Specifically, we want to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can achieve this by iterating through the sorted list and checking each element to see if it is greater than or equal to the specified value. The first time we find such an element, we return its index. If the specified value is greater than all elements in the list, we return the length of the list, which indicates that the value should be inserted at the end.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function left_insertion(arr, value):\n       for index from 0 to length of arr:\n           if arr[index] >= value:\n               return index\n       return length of arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef left_insertion(arr, value):\n    # Iterate through the sorted list\n    for index in range(len(arr)):\n        # Check if the current element is greater than or equal to the value\n        if arr[index] >= value:\n            # Return the index of the first element that is >= value\n            return index\n    # If no such element is found, return the length of the list\n    return len(arr)\n```",
