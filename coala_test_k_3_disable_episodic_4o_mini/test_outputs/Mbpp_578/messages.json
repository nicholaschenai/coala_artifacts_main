The core concept involved alternating the direction of processing (left to right, then right to left) and determining how many elements to take based on the remainder of the current number divided by the count of remaining elements.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a function that attempted to toggle the direction after processing the entire array. However, this approach led to incorrect handling of indices and sub-arrays, resulting in runtime errors and failure to produce the expected output. The main issues were related to not properly skipping over elements that were included in sub-arrays and incorrectly resetting the index for the next run.\n\n    The key strategies that did not work included:\n    - Incorrectly managing the index after processing sub-arrays, which caused the function to either miss elements or exceed the bounds of the list.\n    - Failing to correctly toggle the direction and set the index for the next run based on the direction of processing.\n\n    To fix these issues, I needed to ensure that the index was adjusted correctly after processing each element or sub-array, and that the direction was toggled appropriately without losing track of the current position in the list. \n\n    The final implementation should focus on:\n    - Correctly calculating the remainder and determining when to create sub-arrays.\n    - Properly managing the index and direction to ensure all elements are processed as required.\n\n    Here is the last attempted code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n        if depth == 0:\n            return flat_array\n    \n        new_array = []\n        direction = 1  # Start with left to right\n        index = 0  # Starting index for left to right\n    \n        while index < len(flat_array):\n            current_number = flat_array[index]\n            remaining_elements = len(flat_array) - index\n            remainder = current_number % remaining_elements\n        \n            if remainder < 3:\n                new_array.append(current_number)\n                index += 1\n            else:\n                sub_array = flat_array[index:index + remainder]\n                new_array.append(unflatten(sub_array, depth - 1))\n                index += remainder\n        \n            # Direction handling logic needs to be revisited for correctness\n    \n        return new_array\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing indices and understanding the flow of recursive functions, especially when dealing with nested structures.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective attendance frequencies. The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.\n\n    The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.\n\n    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.\n\n    Key code snippets included:\n    ```python\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            temp = b\n            b = a % b\n            a = temp\n        return a\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\n    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):\n        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)\n\n    def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):\n        total_hours = N * 24\n        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        return total_hours // lcm_value\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\n    In tackling the problem of determining if three adjacent sides of a cube are painted the same color, my initial approach was logically sound and correctly identified the necessary combinations of sides to check. However, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient implementation.\n\n    **Key Insights from the Official Solution:**\n    1. **Use of Indexing**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides directly. This approach simplifies the checking process by avoiding multiple conditional statements and instead iterating through predefined combinations.\n  \n    2. **Set for Uniqueness**: The official solution leverages the `set` data structure to check if all three colors are the same. By converting the list of colors to a set, it effectively checks for uniqueness in a single line, which is both elegant and efficient.\n\n    3. **Control Flow**: The use of a counter (`c`) to track whether a match was found is straightforward, but the official solution could be further simplified by directly printing \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on the condition without needing an additional variable.\n\n    **Comparison with My Approach**:\n    - My solution explicitly checked each combination with multiple `or` conditions, which, while clear, could be seen as verbose compared to the official solution's use of a loop over a predefined list of combinations.\n    - The official solution's use of `set` for checking color equality is a more Pythonic approach, reducing the complexity of the condition checks.\n\n    ### Conclusion\n    The official solution is more efficient in terms of readability and maintainability. It highlights the importance of leveraging built-in data structures and concise control flow in Python. In future problems, I will aim to adopt similar strategies to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
