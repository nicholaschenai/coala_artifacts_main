    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to determine the minimum number of rotations needed to make a string identical to itself. A rotation involves moving characters from the front of the string to the back. For example, rotating \"abc\" once results in \"bca\", and rotating it again results in \"cab\". The goal is to find out how many such rotations are necessary to return to the original string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and simulate the rotations. For each rotation, we check if the string matches the original string. We start counting from 1 (since the problem specifies rotations greater than 0) and continue until we either find a match or complete a full cycle of rotations (which would be equal to the length of the string). If we reach the original string again, we return the count of rotations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_Rotations(s):\n       original_string = s\n       length = length of s\n       for i from 1 to length:\n           rotate the string by moving the first character to the end\n           if the rotated string equals original_string:\n               return i\n       return length  # This case should not happen as per problem statement\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_Rotations(s: str) -> int:\n    # Store the original string to compare with\n    original_string = s\n    # Get the length of the string\n    length = len(s)\n    \n    # Iterate through possible rotations\n    for i in range(1, length + 1):\n        # Rotate the string by moving the first character to the end\n        s = s[1:] + s[0]\n        # Check if the rotated string matches the original\n        if s == original_string:\n            return i  # Return the number of rotations needed\n    \n    return length  # This case should not happen as per problem statement\n```",
