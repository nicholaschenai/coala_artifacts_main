    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that checks if the product of all numbers in a given list is even. If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if the product of numbers in a list is even, we can simply check if there is at least one even number in the list. This is because the product of any number with an even number is always even. If all numbers are odd, the product will be odd. Therefore, we can iterate through the list and return `True` if we find an even number; if we finish checking all numbers without finding an even one, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_product_even(numbers):\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_product_even(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If an even number is found, return True\n            return True\n    # If no even number is found, return False\n    return False\n```",
