    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that finds all perfect square numbers between two given integers, inclusive. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Identify the range of numbers between the two given integers.\n   - Check each number in that range to see if it is a perfect square.\n   - A number is a perfect square if the square root of that number is an integer.\n   - Collect all the perfect squares found in a list and return that list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function perfect_squares(start, end):\n       create an empty list to store perfect squares\n       for each number from start to end:\n           calculate the integer square root of the number\n           if the square of the integer square root equals the number:\n               add the number to the list of perfect squares\n       return the list of perfect squares\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    # Calculate the integer square root of n\n    root = int(n**0.5)\n    # Check if the square of the root equals n\n    return root * root == n\n\ndef perfect_squares(start: int, end: int) -> list:\n    # Create an empty list to store perfect squares\n    squares = []\n    # Iterate through each number in the range from start to end\n    for num in range(start, end + 1):\n        # Check if the number is a perfect square\n        if is_perfect_square(num):\n            # If it is, add it to the list\n            squares.append(num)\n    # Return the list of perfect squares\n    return squares\n```",
