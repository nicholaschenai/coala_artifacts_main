The key insight is recognizing that the number of rooms that can be tiled completely is directly related to the largest perfect square that can be formed with the tiles available. \n\n    ### Key Steps in the Official Solution:\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads multiple test cases efficiently using `stdin`.\n    2. **Dividing by 2**: The number of tiles in each box is halved (`n //= 2`) because each box can only tile two rooms.\n    3. **Calculating Perfect Squares**: The maximum number of rooms that can be tiled is determined by calculating `2 * int(n**0.5)`, which gives the count of rooms that can be tiled using the largest perfect square less than or equal to `n`.\n\n    ### Insights:\n    - My initial approach involved iterating through all possible room pairs, which is computationally expensive and inefficient, especially given the constraints (up to \\(10^{12}\\)).\n    - The official solution leverages mathematical properties of perfect squares and the relationship between the number of tiles and room areas, leading to a constant time complexity for each test case after the initial input read.\n    - This experience highlights the importance of recognizing patterns and mathematical relationships in problems, which can significantly simplify the solution and improve performance. \n\n    In future problems, I should consider looking for mathematical shortcuts or properties that can reduce the complexity of the solution rather than relying solely on brute force methods.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved maximizing the sum of pizza slice sizes taken from a circular array, where the picking order was constrained by the actions of two friends. The key insight was to use dynamic programming to handle the circular nature of the problem by considering two cases: one where the first slice is included and the last slice is excluded, and another where the first slice is excluded and the last slice is included.\n\n    The solution utilized a helper function to compute the maximum sum of slices that could be taken given a specific range and the number of slices allowed. The dynamic programming table was structured to keep track of the maximum sums possible for each number of slices taken.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The core concepts involved were dynamic programming and handling circular arrays, which are common in optimization problems. The solution was straightforward and did not encounter unexpected errors, indicating a solid understanding of the problem requirements and constraints. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculateMaxSum(slices, start, end, k):\n        dp = [[0] * (end - start + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]\n        for i in range(start, end + 1):\n            for j in range(min(i - start + 1, k), 0, -1):\n                dp[j][i - start] = max(dp[j][i - start - 1], \n                                       dp[j - 1][i - start - 2] + slices[i])\n        return dp[k][end - start]\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine how many rooms in two houses could be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where each box contained a number of tiles equal to its index. The challenge involved ensuring that tiles from a single box were used to tile two rooms, one in each house, and that the total area of the rooms matched the number of tiles.\n\n    The core concept revolved around checking pairs of rooms to see if their combined area equaled the number of tiles in an even-indexed box. The solution involved iterating through all boxes and checking all possible pairs of rooms, which could be computationally expensive given the constraints (up to \\(10^{12}\\) for N). \n\n    The initial approach was to use nested loops to check each box and room combination, but this would not scale well for large values of N. However, the provided solution worked correctly for smaller inputs, as evidenced by passing the sample test case.\n\n    In future implementations, a more efficient algorithm would be necessary to handle larger values of N, possibly by leveraging mathematical properties of perfect squares or optimizing the search for room pairs. The final code snippet that worked for the sample input is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(N):\n        total_rooms = 0\n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                for j1 in range(1, N + 1):\n                    for j2 in range(1, N + 1):\n                        if j1 != j2 and j1 * j1 + j2 * j2 == i:\n                            total_rooms += 2\n                            break\n        return total_rooms\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary highlights the problem-solving approach, the challenges faced, and the need for optimization in future attempts.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
