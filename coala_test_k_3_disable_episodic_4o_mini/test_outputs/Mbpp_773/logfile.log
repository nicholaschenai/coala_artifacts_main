INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/773 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that searches for a specific substring within a given string. If the substring is found, the function should return the substring along with the starting and ending positions of its first occurrence. If the substring is not found, the function should return None.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in string method `find()` which returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in the string. If the substring is not found, it returns -1. We will check the result of `find()`, and if it is not -1, we will calculate the ending position of the substring by adding its length to the starting position. Finally, we will return the substring along with its starting and ending positions. If the substring is not found, we will return None.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function occurance_substring(main_string, substring):
       start_index = main_string.find(substring)
       if start_index is -1:
           return None
       end_index = start_index + length of substring
       return (substring, start_index, end_index)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def occurance_substring(main_string: str, substring: str):
    # Find the starting index of the substring in the main string
    start_index = main_string.find(substring)
    
    # If the substring is not found, return None
    if start_index == -1:
        return None
    
    # Calculate the ending index of the substring
    end_index = start_index + len(substring)
    
    # Return the substring along with its starting and ending positions
    return (substring, start_index, end_index)

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the minimum window substring in a string `S` that contains all characters from another string `T`. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is efficient for this type of problem. The key concepts involved were maintaining character counts and dynamically adjusting the window size using two pointers.

    The implementation involved creating two dictionaries: one for counting characters in `T` and another for the current window in `S`. The algorithm expanded the right pointer to include characters until all required characters were present, then contracted the left pointer to minimize the window size while still containing all characters from `T`. This approach ensured that the solution operated in O(n) time complexity.

    The final code snippet effectively captured this logic:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
            # Character counting and sliding window logic
            ...
    ```

    Overall, the sliding window technique proved to be a robust strategy for solving the problem, and the implementation was successful without any unexpected errors. The solution was efficient and met the problem's requirements.
