    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and calculates the product of all unique numbers in that list. For example, if the input list contains duplicates, we should only consider each unique number once when calculating the product.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Create a set from the input list to automatically filter out duplicate numbers, as sets only store unique values.\n   - Initialize a variable to hold the product, starting at 1.\n   - Iterate through the unique numbers in the set, multiplying them together to get the final product.\n   - Return the product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function unique_product(numbers):\n       unique_numbers = set(numbers)  // Create a set from the list to get unique numbers\n       product = 1                     // Initialize product to 1\n       for number in unique_numbers:    // Iterate through each unique number\n           product *= number            // Multiply the product by the current number\n       return product                   // Return the final product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef unique_product(numbers):\n    # Create a set from the list to get unique numbers\n    unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n    \n    # Initialize product to 1\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Iterate through each unique number\n    for number in unique_numbers:\n        # Multiply the product by the current number\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Return the final product\n    return product\n```",
