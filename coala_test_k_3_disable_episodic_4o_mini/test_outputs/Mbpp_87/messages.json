The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In attempting to solve the problem of finding the shortest superstring that contains all given strings as substrings, I initially focused on generating permutations of the input strings and merging them based on maximum overlaps. However, the approach failed to account for the order of merging, which is crucial for achieving the shortest result. \n\n    The core concept tested in this problem is the ability to efficiently merge strings while maximizing overlaps, which can significantly reduce the length of the resulting superstring. The strategy of using permutations was sound, but the merging logic needed to be more comprehensive to explore all possible combinations effectively.\n\n    One key error was not considering that different orders of merging could yield different results. For example, merging \"loves\" and \"alex\" first could lead to a shorter superstring than merging \"alex\" and \"loves\" first. This oversight led to incorrect outputs in tests.\n\n    In future attempts, a more robust backtracking approach that explores all combinations of merging strings while keeping track of overlaps would be beneficial. Additionally, ensuring that the merging logic is flexible enough to handle various arrangements will be crucial for solving similar problems effectively.\n\n    Here\u2019s a concise version of the merging logic that was used:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_overlap(s1, s2):\n        max_len = 0\n        for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n            if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n                max_len = i\n        return max_len\n\n    def merge(s1, s2):\n        overlap = max_overlap(s1, s2)\n        return s1 + s2[overlap:]\n    ```\n\n    This logic is essential for merging strings based on their overlaps, but it needs to be integrated into a more comprehensive solution that considers all possible orders of merging.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.\n\n    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.\n\n    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.\n\n    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Read number of boxes and capacity of each box\n            ducks = case[2]  # Read the list of duck counts\n            boxes = []  # This will hold the distribution of ducks in each box\n        \n            # Create a list of colors with their counts\n            color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]\n        \n            # Fill each box\n            for _ in range(N):\n                m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box\n                c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box\n            \n                # Try to fill the box with ducks\n                for i in range(len(color_counts)):\n                    if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full\n                        if color_counts[i][1] > 0:  # If there are ducks of this color\n                            if c1 == -1:  # First color\n                                c1 = color_counts[i][0]\n                                m1 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible\n                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m1)  # Update count\n                            elif c2 == -1:  # Second color\n                                c2 = color_counts[i][0]\n                                m2 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible\n                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m2)  # Update count\n            \n                # If we have only one color, ensure the other is set to 0\n                if c2 == -1:\n                    c2 = 0\n                    m2 = 0\n            \n                # Append the box configuration\n                boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))\n        \n            # Output the boxes\n            for box in boxes:\n                print(box[0], box[1], box[2], box[3])\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the challenges faced, and the final solution that met all requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
