    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes two tuples as input. Each tuple contains a series of numbers. The function should subtract the corresponding elements of the first tuple from the elements of the second tuple, returning a new tuple with the results.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through both tuples simultaneously, subtracting each element in the second tuple from the corresponding element in the first tuple. We will store the results of these subtractions in a new tuple, which we will return at the end.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function substract_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n       create an empty list to hold results\n       for each index in the range of the length of tuple1:\n           subtract tuple2[index] from tuple1[index]\n           append the result to the results list\n       convert the results list to a tuple\n       return the new tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef substract_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Create an empty list to hold results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through both tuples using their indices\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Subtract the elements of the second tuple from the first\n        result = tuple1[i] - tuple2[i]\n        # Append the result to the results list\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Convert the results list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(results)\n```",
