1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/251 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of elements and a single element. The function should insert the given element before each element in the list and return the new list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can create a new list that will hold the result. We will iterate through each element in the input list, and for each element, we will first add the specified element to the new list, followed by the current element from the input list. Finally, we will return the new list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function insert_element(input_list, element):
       create an empty list called result
       for each item in input_list:
           append element to result
           append item to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def insert_element(input_list, element):
    # Create an empty list to hold the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each item in the input list
    for item in input_list:
        # Append the specified element to the result list
        result.append(element)
        # Append the current item from the input list to the result list
        result.append(item)
    
    # Return the resulting list
    return result

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In attempting to solve the problem of unflattening a list based on specific rules, I encountered several challenges related to correctly managing the direction of processing and handling sub-arrays. The core concept involved alternating the direction of processing (left to right, then right to left) and determining how many elements to take based on the remainder of the current number divided by the count of remaining elements.

    Initially, I implemented a function that attempted to toggle the direction after processing the entire array. However, this approach led to incorrect handling of indices and sub-arrays, resulting in runtime errors and failure to produce the expected output. The main issues were related to not properly skipping over elements that were included in sub-arrays and incorrectly resetting the index for the next run.

    The key strategies that did not work included:
    - Incorrectly managing the index after processing sub-arrays, which caused the function to either miss elements or exceed the bounds of the list.
    - Failing to correctly toggle the direction and set the index for the next run based on the direction of processing.

    To fix these issues, I needed to ensure that the index was adjusted correctly after processing each element or sub-array, and that the direction was toggled appropriately without losing track of the current position in the list. 

    The final implementation should focus on:
    - Correctly calculating the remainder and determining when to create sub-arrays.
    - Properly managing the index and direction to ensure all elements are processed as required.

    Here is the last attempted code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def unflatten(flat_array, depth):
        if depth == 0:
            return flat_array
    
        new_array = []
        direction = 1  # Start with left to right
        index = 0  # Starting index for left to right
    
        while index < len(flat_array):
            current_number = flat_array[index]
            remaining_elements = len(flat_array) - index
            remainder = current_number % remaining_elements
        
            if remainder < 3:
                new_array.append(current_number)
                index += 1
            else:
                sub_array = flat_array[index:index + remainder]
                new_array.append(unflatten(sub_array, depth - 1))
                index += remainder
        
            # Direction handling logic needs to be revisited for correctness
    
        return new_array
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing indices and understanding the flow of recursive functions, especially when dealing with nested structures.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I implemented a solution to find the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concept involved identifying the rightmost ascent in the permutation, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.

    The implementation followed a clear structure: a helper function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution successfully handled multiple permutations as specified in the problem statement.

    One key takeaway is the importance of understanding the mechanics of generating permutations, particularly the lexicographic order. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. The code was tested against sample inputs, and it produced the expected outputs, confirming its correctness. 

    Here’s the essential code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def next_permutation(arr):
        i = len(arr) - 2
        while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:
            i -= 1
        if i == -1:
            arr.reverse()
            return arr
        j = len(arr) - 1
        while arr[j] <= arr[i]:
            j -= 1
        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])
        return arr

    def main():
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        results = []
        for _ in range(K):
            permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))
            next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, next_perm)))
        print("\n".join(results))

    main()
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the solution's structure, which can be useful for similar tasks in the future.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. 

    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach of generating all possible strings by removing and reinserting characters was effective, and the use of comparisons to track the smallest string worked as intended.

    The final implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each string, and outputting the results. The code was structured to first define the main function and then handle input/output, ensuring clarity and separation of logic. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. 

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    for i in range(N):  # Iterate through each character
        char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to move
        remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remove the character
        for j in range(N):  # Try to insert the character at every position
            new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]
            if new_string < smallest_string:  # Check if the new string is smaller
                smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of string manipulation techniques and careful iteration when solving combinatorial problems.
