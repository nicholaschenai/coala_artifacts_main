    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and converts all of its characters to lowercase. For example, if the input string is \"InValid\", the output should be \"invalid\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To convert a string to lowercase, we can iterate through each character in the string. For each character, we will check if it is an uppercase letter. If it is, we will convert it to its corresponding lowercase letter. We can use the ASCII values of the characters to perform this conversion. Finally, we will join all the characters back together to form the resulting lowercase string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `is_lower` that takes a string `s`.\n   - Initialize an empty list `lowercase_chars` to store the lowercase characters.\n   - For each character `c` in the string `s`:\n     - If `c` is between 'A' and 'Z' (uppercase letters):\n       - Convert `c` to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value and append it to `lowercase_chars`.\n     - Otherwise, append `c` to `lowercase_chars` as it is.\n   - Join all characters in `lowercase_chars` to form the final string.\n   - Return the final string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef is_lower(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty list to hold the lowercase characters\n    lowercase_chars = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for c in s:\n        # Check if the character is an uppercase letter\n        if 'A' <= c <= 'Z':\n            # Convert to lowercase by adding 32 to the ASCII value\n            lowercase_chars.append(chr(ord(c) + 32))\n        else:\n            # If it's not uppercase, keep the character as is\n            lowercase_chars.append(c)\n    \n    # Join the list of characters into a single string\n    return ''.join(lowercase_chars)\n```",
