The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving subarrays and counts.\n\n    The core concept involved maintaining a count of odd numbers within a window defined by two pointers (left and right). As the right pointer expanded the window, the odd count was updated. If the count exceeded `k`, the left pointer was incremented to reduce the count back to `k`. When the count matched `k`, the number of valid subarrays was calculated by counting the even numbers to the left of the current window.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the sliding window technique is suitable for this type of problem. The key takeaway is the importance of managing two pointers to dynamically adjust the window size while keeping track of specific conditions (in this case, the count of odd numbers). \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n            result = 0\n            left = 0\n            odd_count = 0\n        \n            for right in range(len(nums)):\n                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:\n                    odd_count += 1\n            \n                while odd_count > k:\n                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:\n                        odd_count -= 1\n                    left += 1\n            \n                if odd_count == k:\n                    temp_left = left\n                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:\n                        temp_left += 1\n                    result += (temp_left - left + 1)\n        \n            return result\n    ``` \n\n    This approach effectively counts the desired subarrays while maintaining a linear time complexity, making it suitable for larger input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, specifically after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements. The key insight was recognizing that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to the Pisano period. This allowed for efficient computation even for very large values of N (up to 10^18).\n\n    The solution was structured into three main functions: one to compute the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using the Pisano period, another to determine the last remaining number after the removal process, and a final function to handle input and output. The approach of reducing N by half in each iteration of the removal process was effective, as it directly correlated with the position in the last digits array.\n\n    The final implementation passed the provided test cases successfully, demonstrating that the strategy of leveraging the periodicity of Fibonacci last digits was both efficient and effective. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The solution is useful for similar problems involving sequences and periodicity. \n\n    Key code snippets:\n    ```python\n    def last_digit_fibonacci(n):\n        # Calculate the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using Pisano period\n        ...\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(n):\n        # Find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements\n        ...\n\n    def solve():\n        # Handle input and output\n        ...\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
