INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/8 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing the squares of each of those numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the input list, calculate its square by multiplying the number by itself, and then store the result in a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing all the squared values.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Function square_nums(input_list):
       Create an empty list called squared_list
       For each number in input_list:
           Calculate the square of the number
           Append the square to squared_list
       Return squared_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def square_nums(input_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the squared numbers
    squared_list = []

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I learned that the series can be derived from a mathematical formula rather than through iterative summation. The official solution uses a direct formula to compute the N'th term efficiently, which is more optimal than my initial approach of summing squares.

    The key insight from the official solution is the use of the formula:
    - For N > 1, the N'th term can be calculated as:
      \[
      T(N) = \frac{(N-2 + 1)(2(N-2) + 3)(N-2 + 2)}{6}
      \]
    This formula allows for constant time computation of the N'th term, significantly improving performance, especially for larger values of N (up to 10,000) and multiple test cases (up to 10,000).

    My approach, which involved iterating through the first (N-1) natural numbers to compute the sum of squares, was less efficient and could lead to longer execution times for larger inputs. The official solution's method is not only more concise but also avoids unnecessary loops, making it a better choice for this problem.

    In future problems, I should consider looking for mathematical patterns or formulas that can simplify calculations, especially when dealing with series or sequences. This experience reinforces the importance of analyzing the problem for potential mathematical solutions rather than relying solely on iterative methods.

[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides a much more efficient approach to the problem than my initial attempt. The key insight is recognizing that the number of rooms that can be tiled completely is directly related to the largest perfect square that can be formed with the tiles available. 

    ### Key Steps in the Official Solution:
    1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads multiple test cases efficiently using `stdin`.
    2. **Dividing by 2**: The number of tiles in each box is halved (`n //= 2`) because each box can only tile two rooms.
    3. **Calculating Perfect Squares**: The maximum number of rooms that can be tiled is determined by calculating `2 * int(n**0.5)`, which gives the count of rooms that can be tiled using the largest perfect square less than or equal to `n`.

    ### Insights:
    - My initial approach involved iterating through all possible room pairs, which is computationally expensive and inefficient, especially given the constraints (up to \(10^{12}\)).
    - The official solution leverages mathematical properties of perfect squares and the relationship between the number of tiles and room areas, leading to a constant time complexity for each test case after the initial input read.
    - This experience highlights the importance of recognizing patterns and mathematical relationships in problems, which can significantly simplify the solution and improve performance. 

    In future problems, I should consider looking for mathematical shortcuts or properties that can reduce the complexity of the solution rather than relying solely on brute force methods.
