Finally, we will return this new list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function square_nums(input_list):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for each number in input_list:\n           square the number\n           append the squared number to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef square_nums(input_list):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in input_list:\n        # Calculate the square of the number\n        squared = number * number\n        # Append the squared number to the result list\n        result.append(squared)\n    # Return the list of squared numbers\n    return result\n```",
