The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, including only every Kth Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.\n\n    The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. \n\n    The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def fibonacci(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\n    def S(N, K):\n        sum_fib = 0\n        for i in range(0, N + 1):\n            if i % K == 0:\n                sum_fib += fibonacci(i)\n        return sum_fib\n    ``` \n\n    Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved calculating the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number \"N\" for multiple test cases. The solution required understanding arithmetic series and efficiently calculating the sum without iterating through all multiples, which is crucial given the constraints (N can be as large as 1 billion).\n\n    The approach used was to determine the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, then calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10 up to that point. The sum was computed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. This method is efficient and avoids potential performance issues with large inputs.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway is the importance of leveraging mathematical formulas for series to optimize calculations, especially when dealing with large ranges. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core function used:\n\n    ```python\n    def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n        largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n        number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n        sum_multiples = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2\n        return sum_multiples\n    ```\n\n    This function efficiently computes the desired sum, demonstrating the effectiveness of using arithmetic properties in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
