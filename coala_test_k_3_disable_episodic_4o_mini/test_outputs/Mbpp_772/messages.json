The solution utilized a stack to efficiently manage character counts and removals. The core concept was to iterate through the string, pushing characters onto the stack while tracking their counts. When a character's count reached `k`, it was removed from the stack.\n\n    The strategy of using a stack worked effectively, as it allowed for easy access to the last character and its count, facilitating quick updates and removals. The final string was constructed by joining the characters left in the stack, multiplied by their respective counts.\n\n    The implemented solution was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without issues. The key takeaway is the utility of stacks in problems involving consecutive elements and counts, which can simplify the logic and improve efficiency. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n            stack = []\n            for char in s:\n                if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                    stack[-1][1] += 1\n                    if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                        stack.pop()\n                else:\n                    stack.append([char, 1])\n            result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)\n            return result\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring \"abc\" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of \"abc\" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of \"abc\". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reference Code (Not callable)]:\n\n    [description]\n    The function processes a string to remove consecutive duplicate characters that appear k times. It uses a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as it iterates through the string. When a character matches the one at the top of the stack, its count is incremented, and if the count reaches k, that character is removed from the stack. If the character does not match, it is added to the stack with an initial count of 1. Finally, the function constructs and returns a new string based on the characters remaining in the stack. This effectively reduces the string by removing specified consecutive duplicates.\n\n    [end of description]\n    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to process strings for data cleaning, compression, or transformation tasks. For example, in text processing applications, you might want to remove repeated characters to simplify the data or prepare it for further analysis. Additionally, this algorithm can be applied in game development for handling character sequences or in any application where string manipulation is required, especially when dealing with large datasets where performance is a concern.\n\n\n    class Solution:\n        def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n            # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n            stack = []\n        \n            # Iterate through each character in the string\n            for char in s:\n                # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character\n                if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                    # Increment the count of the top character\n                    stack[-1][1] += 1\n                    # If the count reaches k, pop the character from the stack\n                    if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                        stack.pop()\n                else:\n                    # Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack with a count of 1\n                    stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n            # Construct the final string from the characters in the stack\n            result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)\n        \n            return result\n\n[/Reference Code (Not callable)]\n\n"
