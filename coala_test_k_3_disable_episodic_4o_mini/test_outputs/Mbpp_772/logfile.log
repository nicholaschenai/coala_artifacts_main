INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/772 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string and an integer `k`, and removes all the words from the string that have a length of `k`. The function should return the modified string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Split the input string into individual words.
   - Iterate through the list of words and check the length of each word.
   - If a word's length is not equal to `k`, keep it; otherwise, discard it.
   - Join the remaining words back into a single string with spaces in between and return this new string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function remove_length(input_string, k):
       split input_string into words
       create an empty list for filtered words
       for each word in words:
           if length of word is not equal to k:
               add word to filtered words
       join filtered words into a single string with spaces
       return the new string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def remove_length(input_string: str, k: int) -> str:
    # Split the input string into individual words
    words = input_string.split()
    # Create an empty list to hold words that are not of length k
    filtered_words = []
    # Iterate through each word in the list of words
    for word in words:
        # Check if the length of the word is not equal to k
        if len(word) != k:
            # If not, add the word to the filtered list
            filtered_words.append(word)
    # Join the filtered words back into a single string with spaces
    return ' '.join(filtered_words)

[Summary]:
    The problem involved removing adjacent duplicate characters from a string based on a specified count `k`. The solution utilized a stack to efficiently manage character counts and removals. The core concept was to iterate through the string, pushing characters onto the stack while tracking their counts. When a character's count reached `k`, it was removed from the stack.

    The strategy of using a stack worked effectively, as it allowed for easy access to the last character and its count, facilitating quick updates and removals. The final string was constructed by joining the characters left in the stack, multiplied by their respective counts.

    The implemented solution was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without issues. The key takeaway is the utility of stacks in problems involving consecutive elements and counts, which can simplify the logic and improve efficiency. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
            stack = []
            for char in s:
                if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                    stack[-1][1] += 1
                    if stack[-1][1] == k:
                        stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append([char, 1])
            result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)
            return result
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.
[/Summary]


[Reference Code (Not callable)]:

    [description]
    The function processes a string to remove consecutive duplicate characters that appear k times. It uses a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as it iterates through the string. When a character matches the one at the top of the stack, its count is incremented, and if the count reaches k, that character is removed from the stack. If the character does not match, it is added to the stack with an initial count of 1. Finally, the function constructs and returns a new string based on the characters remaining in the stack. This effectively reduces the string by removing specified consecutive duplicates.

    [end of description]
    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to process strings for data cleaning, compression, or transformation tasks. For example, in text processing applications, you might want to remove repeated characters to simplify the data or prepare it for further analysis. Additionally, this algorithm can be applied in game development for handling character sequences or in any application where string manipulation is required, especially when dealing with large datasets where performance is a concern.


    class Solution:
        def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
            # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts
            stack = []
        
            # Iterate through each character in the string
            for char in s:
                # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character
                if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                    # Increment the count of the top character
                    stack[-1][1] += 1
                    # If the count reaches k, pop the character from the stack
                    if stack[-1][1] == k:
                        stack.pop()
                else:
                    # Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack with a count of 1
                    stack.append([char, 1])
        
            # Construct the final string from the characters in the stack
            result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)
        
            return result
