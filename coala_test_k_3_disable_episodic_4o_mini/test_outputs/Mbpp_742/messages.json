The solution involved using the properties of right triangles, specifically the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. \n\n    The approach was to derive a quadratic equation based on the relationship between the sides and the area, and then solve for the lengths of the legs of the triangle. The discriminant of the quadratic equation was crucial in determining whether valid triangle sides could be found. If the discriminant was negative, it indicated that no valid triangle could be formed.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled multiple test cases and formatted the output correctly. Key points included ensuring that the sides were sorted and that the output precision met the requirements.

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Discriminant Check**: The solution first checks if the expression \\( (H^4 - 16S^2) \\) is negative. If it is, it immediately outputs -1, indicating that a triangle cannot be formed. This is a crucial step to avoid unnecessary calculations when the conditions for forming a triangle are not met.\n\n    2. **Calculating the Base and Height**: The solution uses a mathematical approach to derive the lengths of the triangle's legs (base \\( B \\) and height \\( P \\)). It calculates \\( B \\) using the formula:\n       \\[\n       B = \\frac{\\sqrt{H^2 + \\sqrt{H^4 - 16S^2}}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n       \\]\n       This formula effectively derives one leg of the triangle based on the hypotenuse and area.\n\n    3. **Calculating the Other Leg**: The height \\( P \\) is calculated using the area:\n       \\[\n       P = \\frac{2S}{B}\n       \\]\n       This ensures that the area condition is satisfied.\n\n    4. **Output Formatting**: The solution ensures that the output is formatted to six decimal places, which is important for precision in floating-point arithmetic.\n\n    5. **Sorting the Sides**: The solution checks which of the two legs \\( B \\) and \\( P \\) is larger and prints them in non-decreasing order along with the hypotenuse \\( H \\).\n\n    Overall, the official solution is efficient and leverages mathematical properties effectively, reducing the complexity of the problem. My initial approach was more verbose and involved solving a quadratic equation, which, while valid, was not as direct or efficient as the method used in the official solution. The official solution's use of direct calculations and checks for feasibility before proceeding with further calculations is a valuable lesson in optimizing problem-solving strategies.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Reference Code (Not callable)]:\n\n    [description for function: solve]\n    This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the height and area of a triangle.

Finally, it prints all results, each on a new line.\n\n    [end of description]\n    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the feasibility of constructing a right-angled triangle given specific constraints on the hypotenuse and area.
