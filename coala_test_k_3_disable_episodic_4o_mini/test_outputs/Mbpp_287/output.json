    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes an integer `n` and calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the even natural numbers are 2 and 4, and their squares are 4 and 16, respectively. The sum of these squares is 20.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to identify the first `n` even natural numbers. The `k`-th even natural number can be expressed as `2 * k`. Therefore, the first `n` even natural numbers are `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`. We will then calculate the square of each of these numbers and sum them up to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function square_Sum(n):\n       initialize total to 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           even_number = 2 * i\n           total += even_number * even_number  // square the even number and add to total\n       return total\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    # Initialize total to store the sum of squares\n    total = 0\n    # Loop through the first n even natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        even_number = 2 * i  # Calculate the i-th even natural number\n        total += even_number * even_number  # Square the even number and add to total\n    return total  # Return the final sum of squares\n```",
