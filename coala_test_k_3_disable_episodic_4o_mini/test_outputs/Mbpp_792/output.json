    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that counts how many lists are present in a given list of lists. For example, if we have a list containing four sublists, the function should return 4.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of elements in the input list. Since the input is a list of lists, we can simply use the built-in `len()` function to count how many sublists are present.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_list(lists):\n       return the length of lists\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_list(lists):\n    # Use the built-in len() function to count the number of lists\n    return len(lists)\n\n# The function count_list is declared last as per the instructions.\n```",
