2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/297 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list which may contain other lists (nested lists) and returns a single list with all the elements from the nested lists combined into one flat list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To flatten the list, we can iterate through each element of the input list. If an element is a list itself, we will need to go deeper into that list and extract its elements. If an element is not a list, we will simply add it to our result list. This process will continue recursively until all elements are extracted and combined into a single list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function flatten_list(nested_list):
       create an empty list called flat_list
       for each element in nested_list:
           if element is a list:
               call flatten_list recursively on element and extend flat_list with the result
           else:
               append element to flat_list
       return flat_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    # Create an empty list to hold the flattened result
    flat_list = []
    
    # Iterate through each element in the provided nested list
    for element in nested_list:
        # Check if the current element is a list
        if isinstance(element, list):
            # If it is a list, recursively flatten it and extend the flat_list with the result
            flat_list.extend(flatten_list(element))
        else:
            # If it is not a list, append the element to flat_list
            flat_list.append(element)
    
    # Return the fully flattened list
    return flat_list

[Summary]:
    In attempting to solve the problem of unflattening a list based on specific rules, I encountered several challenges related to correctly managing the direction of processing and handling sub-arrays. The core concept involved alternating the direction of processing (left to right, then right to left) and determining how many elements to take based on the remainder of the current number divided by the count of remaining elements.

    Initially, I implemented a function that attempted to toggle the direction after processing the entire array. However, this approach led to incorrect handling of indices and sub-arrays, resulting in runtime errors and failure to produce the expected output. The main issues were related to not properly skipping over elements that were included in sub-arrays and incorrectly resetting the index for the next run.

    The key strategies that did not work included:
    - Incorrectly managing the index after processing sub-arrays, which caused the function to either miss elements or exceed the bounds of the list.
    - Failing to correctly toggle the direction and set the index for the next run based on the direction of processing.

    To fix these issues, I needed to ensure that the index was adjusted correctly after processing each element or sub-array, and that the direction was toggled appropriately without losing track of the current position in the list. 

    The final implementation should focus on:
    - Correctly calculating the remainder and determining when to create sub-arrays.
    - Properly managing the index and direction to ensure all elements are processed as required.

    Here is the last attempted code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def unflatten(flat_array, depth):
        if depth == 0:
            return flat_array
    
        new_array = []
        direction = 1  # Start with left to right
        index = 0  # Starting index for left to right
    
        while index < len(flat_array):
            current_number = flat_array[index]
            remaining_elements = len(flat_array) - index
            remainder = current_number % remaining_elements
        
            if remainder < 3:
                new_array.append(current_number)
                index += 1
            else:
                sub_array = flat_array[index:index + remainder]
                new_array.append(unflatten(sub_array, depth - 1))
                index += remainder
        
            # Direction handling logic needs to be revisited for correctness
    
        return new_array
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing indices and understanding the flow of recursive functions, especially when dealing with nested structures.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution to the unflattening problem uses a concise and recursive approach that effectively handles the requirements of the task. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

    1. **Recursive Structure:** The function `unflatten` is defined as a lambda function that checks if the current depth (`c`) has reached the specified depth (`d`). If so, it returns the input array as is. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively, alternating the direction of processing based on the current depth.

    2. **Direction Handling:** The direction of processing (left to right or right to left) is managed using a binary flag (`lr`). This flag determines how the index is updated and how elements are processed.

    3. **Parsing Logic:** The `parse` function is responsible for iterating through the array. It uses a while loop to process elements based on the current direction:
       - If the current element is a list, it recursively calls `parse` on that sub-list.
       - If the current element is an integer, it calculates the number of elements to take based on the modulus operation. If the result is greater than or equal to 3, it takes a sub-array; otherwise, it adds the integer directly to the result.

    4. **Index Management:** The index is updated based on the number of elements taken or directly incremented by one, depending on the conditions. The use of list slicing and reversing ensures that the output maintains the correct order.

    5. **Final Output:** The final result is constructed by reversing the order of the output based on the last direction processed, ensuring that the output matches the expected nested structure.

    ### Reflection:
    The official solution is more elegant and efficient than my previous attempts. It effectively uses recursion and concise logic to handle the complexity of the problem without excessive state management. My approach struggled with direction handling and index management, leading to runtime errors and incorrect outputs. The official solution's use of a lambda function and helper function for parsing provides a clear separation of concerns and simplifies the overall logic. This experience highlights the importance of recursive thinking and careful index management in problems involving nested structures.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
