The core concept involved alternating the direction of processing (left to right, then right to left) and determining how many elements to take based on the remainder of the current number divided by the count of remaining elements.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a function that attempted to toggle the direction after processing the entire array. However, this approach led to incorrect handling of indices and sub-arrays, resulting in runtime errors and failure to produce the expected output. The main issues were related to not properly skipping over elements that were included in sub-arrays and incorrectly resetting the index for the next run.\n\n    The key strategies that did not work included:\n    - Incorrectly managing the index after processing sub-arrays, which caused the function to either miss elements or exceed the bounds of the list.\n    - Failing to correctly toggle the direction and set the index for the next run based on the direction of processing.\n\n    To fix these issues, I needed to ensure that the index was adjusted correctly after processing each element or sub-array, and that the direction was toggled appropriately without losing track of the current position in the list. \n\n    The final implementation should focus on:\n    - Correctly calculating the remainder and determining when to create sub-arrays.\n    - Properly managing the index and direction to ensure all elements are processed as required.\n\n    Here is the last attempted code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n        if depth == 0:\n            return flat_array\n    \n        new_array = []\n        direction = 1  # Start with left to right\n        index = 0  # Starting index for left to right\n    \n        while index < len(flat_array):\n            current_number = flat_array[index]\n            remaining_elements = len(flat_array) - index\n            remainder = current_number % remaining_elements\n        \n            if remainder < 3:\n                new_array.append(current_number)\n                index += 1\n            else:\n                sub_array = flat_array[index:index + remainder]\n                new_array.append(unflatten(sub_array, depth - 1))\n                index += remainder\n        \n            # Direction handling logic needs to be revisited for correctness\n    \n        return new_array\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing indices and understanding the flow of recursive functions, especially when dealing with nested structures.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution to the unflattening problem uses a concise and recursive approach that effectively handles the requirements of the task. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Recursive Structure:** The function `unflatten` is defined as a lambda function that checks if the current depth (`c`) has reached the specified depth (`d`). If so, it returns the input array as is. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively, alternating the direction of processing based on the current depth.\n\n    2. **Direction Handling:** The direction of processing (left to right or right to left) is managed using a binary flag (`lr`). This flag determines how the index is updated and how elements are processed.\n\n    3. **Parsing Logic:** The `parse` function is responsible for iterating through the array. It uses a while loop to process elements based on the current direction:\n       - If the current element is a list, it recursively calls `parse` on that sub-list.\n       - If the current element is an integer, it calculates the number of elements to take based on the modulus operation. If the result is greater than or equal to 3, it takes a sub-array; otherwise, it adds the integer directly to the result.\n\n    4. **Index Management:** The index is updated based on the number of elements taken or directly incremented by one, depending on the conditions. The use of list slicing and reversing ensures that the output maintains the correct order.\n\n    5. **Final Output:** The final result is constructed by reversing the order of the output based on the last direction processed, ensuring that the output matches the expected nested structure.\n\n    ### Reflection:\n    The official solution is more elegant and efficient than my previous attempts. It effectively uses recursion and concise logic to handle the complexity of the problem without excessive state management. My approach struggled with direction handling and index management, leading to runtime errors and incorrect outputs. The official solution's use of a lambda function and helper function for parsing provides a clear separation of concerns and simplifies the overall logic. This experience highlights the importance of recursive thinking and careful index management in problems involving nested structures.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
