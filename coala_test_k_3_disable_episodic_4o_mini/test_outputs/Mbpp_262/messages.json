The main challenge was to efficiently find pairs \\( (A, B) \\) such that \\( A \\oplus B = N \\) for each integer \\( N \\) in a given range \\( [L, R] \\). The solution involved defining two functions: \\( F(N) \\) to find the value of \\( B \\) for each \\( N \\), and \\( G(L, R) \\) to sum the results of \\( F(i) \\) for all integers \\( i \\) from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\).\n\n    The core concept was to iterate through possible values of \\( A \\) and compute \\( B \\) using the XOR operation. The conditions \\( 1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq N \\) were crucial for determining valid pairs. The implementation was straightforward, but care had to be taken to ensure efficiency given the constraints, especially since \\( R \\) could be as large as \\( 10^9 \\) and there could be up to \\( 10^5 \\) test cases.\n\n    The final solution was structured to read input efficiently and output results in bulk, which is important for handling large datasets. The code was successfully tested against provided examples, confirming its correctness. The approach of using simple loops and bitwise operations proved effective, although further optimization might be necessary for larger ranges in future scenarios. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def F(N):\n        for A in range(1, N + 1):\n            B = A ^ N\n            if A <= B <= N:\n                return B\n        return -1\n\n    def G(L, R):\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(L, R + 1):\n            total_sum += F(i)\n        return total_sum\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.\n\n    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            if K == N:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
