The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.\n\n    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of \"abacaba\". The logic needed to ensure that after placing \"abacaba\", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. Checking how many times \"abacaba\" already appeared in the string.\n    2. Attempting to place \"abacaba\" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.\n    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.\n    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.\n\n    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            n = case[0]\n            s = case[1]\n            modified_string = list(s)\n\n            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            placed = False\n            for i in range(n - 6):\n                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):\n                    temp_string = modified_string[:]\n                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)\n                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:\n                        modified_string = temp_string\n                        placed = True\n                        break\n\n            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            if final_count != 1:\n                print(\"No\")\n            else:\n                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)\n                print(\"Yes\")\n                print(\"\".join(modified_string))\n\n    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != \"abacaba\"[j]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            s[index + j] = \"abacaba\"[j]\n\n    def count_abacaba(s):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n            if \"\".join(s[i:i + 7]) == \"abacaba\":\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\n    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i] == '?':\n                s[i] = 'z'\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(input())\n        s = input().strip()\n        test_cases.append((n, s))\n\n    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring \"abc\" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of \"abc\" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of \"abc\". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution provides a clear and efficient approach to solving the problem of determining if the substring \"abacaba\" can be formed exactly once in a given string with question marks. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n    1. **Initial Count Check**:\n       - The solution starts by counting how many times \"abacaba\" appears in the string using the `check` function. This is crucial because if it already appears more than once, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n\n    2. **Handling Existing Occurrences**:\n       - If \"abacaba\" is found exactly once, the solution replaces all remaining question marks with 'z' to ensure no additional occurrences are created.\n\n    3. **Constructive Placement**:\n       - If \"abacaba\" is not found at all, the solution attempts to place it in every possible position in the string. It checks if it can fit by replacing question marks with the corresponding characters from \"abacaba\".\n\n    4. **Validation After Placement**:\n       - After attempting to place \"abacaba\", the solution checks if the modified string contains exactly one occurrence of \"abacaba\". If it does, it prints the modified string; otherwise, it continues searching.\n\n    5. **Efficiency**:\n       - The solution efficiently iterates through the string and uses a straightforward approach to check and replace characters, ensuring that it operates within the constraints provided.\n\n    ### Reflection on My Approach:\n    - My initial approach failed to account for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" before attempting to place it, which led to incorrect results in some cases.\n    - The official solution's method of checking for existing occurrences first and then attempting to place \"abacaba\" is more systematic and avoids unnecessary complications.\n    - The use of a temporary list to manipulate the string and check conditions is a good practice that I can adopt in future problems.\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    The official solution effectively combines counting, conditional checks, and constructive placement to solve the problem. It serves as a reminder of the importance of validating conditions before making modifications, especially in string manipulation problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
