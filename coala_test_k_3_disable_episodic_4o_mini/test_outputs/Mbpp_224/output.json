    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that counts how many bits in the binary representation of a given integer are set to 1 (also known as \"set bits\"). For example, the number 2 in binary is represented as `10`, which has one set bit.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To count the number of set bits in a number, we can repeatedly check the least significant bit (LSB) of the number. If the LSB is 1, we increment our count. Then, we right shift the number by one bit to check the next bit. We continue this process until the number becomes zero.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_Set_Bits(n):\n       initialize count to 0\n       while n is greater than 0:\n           if n AND 1 is equal to 1:\n               increment count\n           right shift n by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter for set bits\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Loop until n becomes 0\n    while n > 0:\n        # Check if the least significant bit is set\n        if n & 1 == 1:\n            count += 1  # Increment count if the bit is set\n        n >>= 1  # Right shift n to check the next bit\n    \n    return count  # Return the total count of set bits\n```",
