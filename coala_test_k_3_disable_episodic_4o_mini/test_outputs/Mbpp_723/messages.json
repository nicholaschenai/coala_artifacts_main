The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\n    In tackling the problem of determining if three adjacent sides of a cube are painted the same color, my initial approach was logically sound and correctly identified the necessary combinations of sides to check. However, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient implementation.\n\n    **Key Insights from the Official Solution:**\n    1. **Use of Indexing**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides directly. This approach simplifies the checking process by avoiding multiple conditional statements and instead iterating through predefined combinations.\n  \n    2. **Set for Uniqueness**: The official solution leverages the `set` data structure to check if all three colors are the same. By converting the list of colors to a set, it effectively checks for uniqueness in a single line, which is both elegant and efficient.\n\n    3. **Control Flow**: The use of a counter (`c`) to track whether a match was found is straightforward, but the official solution could be further simplified by directly printing \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on the condition without needing an additional variable.\n\n    **Comparison with My Approach**:\n    - My solution explicitly checked each combination with multiple `or` conditions, which, while clear, could be seen as verbose compared to the official solution's use of a loop over a predefined list of combinations.\n    - The official solution's use of `set` for checking color equality is a more Pythonic approach, reducing the complexity of the condition checks.\n\n    ### Conclusion\n    The official solution is more efficient in terms of readability and maintainability. It highlights the importance of leveraging built-in data structures and concise control flow in Python. In future problems, I will aim to adopt similar strategies to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of pairs `(w, t)` such that the path configuration from `w` to `t` is the same as from `u` to `v` in an infinite binary tree. The key concepts involved were finding the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of the nodes and understanding how to derive valid pairs based on their paths.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a solution that calculated the LCA and attempted to count valid pairs based on the number of nodes reachable from the LCA. However, the approach was flawed as it incorrectly calculated the number of valid pairs by using a formula that did not accurately reflect the path configurations. The errors stemmed from misunderstanding how to count nodes that maintain the same path configuration.\n\n    The correct approach involves:\n    1. Finding the LCA of `u` and `v`.\n    2. Counting the number of nodes that can be reached from the LCA while maintaining the same path configuration as from `u` to `v`.\n\n    Despite multiple revisions, the solution consistently failed to produce the expected results, indicating a deeper misunderstanding of how to derive valid pairs based on the LCA and the specific paths taken.\n\n    Key takeaways:\n    - The importance of correctly interpreting the problem requirements, especially in terms of path configurations.\n    - The need to carefully validate the logic used to count valid pairs based on the structure of the binary tree.\n    - Future attempts should focus on a clearer understanding of how paths are formed in binary trees and how to derive counts based on those paths. \n\n    The final code structure involved functions for finding the LCA and counting pairs, but the logic for counting pairs was not correctly implemented. Here\u2019s a snippet of the last attempt:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_lca(u, v):\n        while u != v:\n            if u > v:\n                u //= 2\n            else:\n                v //= 2\n        return u\n\n    def count_pairs(n, u, v):\n        lca = find_lca(u, v)\n        # Logic for counting pairs needs to be correctly implemented\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the need for a more thorough understanding of tree traversal and path configurations in binary trees.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
