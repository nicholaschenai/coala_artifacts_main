    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find two numbers in a given list of integers that, when multiplied together, produce the highest possible product. The function should return these two numbers as a tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of integers and keep track of the two largest numbers we encounter. Once we have these two largest numbers, we can return them as they will yield the highest product when multiplied together.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_Product(arr):\n       if length of arr is less than 2:\n           return None (or some indication of insufficient elements)\n       \n       initialize first_max and second_max to negative infinity\n       \n       for each number in arr:\n           if number is greater than first_max:\n               update second_max to first_max\n               update first_max to number\n           else if number is greater than second_max:\n               update second_max to number\n       \n       return (first_max, second_max)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_Product(arr):\n    # Check if the array has at least two elements\n    if len(arr) < 2:\n        return None  # Not enough elements to form a pair\n    \n    # Initialize the two largest numbers\n    first_max = float('-inf')\n    second_max = float('-inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through the array to find the two largest numbers\n    for number in arr:\n        if number > first_max:\n            # Update both first and second max\n            second_max = first_max\n            first_max = number\n        elif number > second_max:\n            # Update only the second max\n            second_max = number\n    \n    # Return the pair with the highest product\n    return (first_max, second_max)\n```",
