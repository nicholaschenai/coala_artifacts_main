INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string of brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) is balanced. A string is considered balanced if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the expression is balanced, we can use a stack data structure. We will iterate through each character in the string:
   - If we encounter an opening bracket (i.e., '(', '{', or '['), we will push it onto the stack.
   - If we encounter a closing bracket (i.e., ')', '}', or ']'), we will check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, we pop the top of the stack. If not, the expression is unbalanced.
   - At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is unbalanced.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_expression(expression):
       create an empty stack
       for each character in expression:
           if character is '(', '{', or '[':
               push character onto the stack
           else if character is ')', '}', or ']':
               if stack is empty:
                   return False
               top = pop from stack
               if character does not match top:
                   return False
       return True if stack is empty, else return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python

    # Create an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets

    Title: Balanced bracket sequences
    Part: 1/2
    # Balanced bracket sequences

    A **balanced bracket sequence** is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence, when inserted certain numbers and mathematical operations, gives a valid mathematical expression.
    Formally you can define balanced bracket sequence with:

    - $e$ (the empty string) is a balanced bracket sequence.
    - if $s$ is a balanced bracket sequence, then so is $(s)$.
    - if $s$ and $t$ are balanced bracket sequences, then so is $s t$.

    For instance $(())()$ is a balanced bracket sequence, but $())($ is not.

    Of course you can define other bracket sequences also with multiple bracket types in a similar fashion.

    In this article we discuss some classic problems involving balanced bracket sequences (for simplicity we will only call them sequences): validation, number of sequences, finding the lexicographical next sequence, generating all sequences of a certain size, finding the index of sequence, and generating the $k$-th sequences.
    We will also discuss two variations for the problems, the simpler version when only one type of brackets is allowed, and the harder case when there are multiple types.

    ## Balance validation

    We want to check if a given string is balanced or not.

    At first suppose there is only one type of bracket.
    For this case there exists a very simple algorithm.
    Let $\text{depth}$ be the current number of open brackets.
    Initially $\text{depth} = 0$.
    We iterate over all character of the string, if the current bracket character is an opening bracket, then we increment $\text{depth}$, otherwise we decrement it.
    If at any time the variable $\text{depth}$ gets negative, or at the end it is different from $0$, then the string is not a balanced sequence.
    Otherwise it is.

    If there are several bracket types involved, then the algorithm needs to be changes.
    Instead of a counter $\text{depth}$ we create a stack, in which we will store all opening brackets that we meet.
    If the current bracket character is an opening one, we put it onto the stack.
    If it is a closing one, then we check if the stack is non-empty, and if the top element of the stack is of the same type as the current closing bracket.
    If both conditions are fulfilled, then we remove the opening bracket from the stack.
    If at any time one of the conditions is not fulfilled, or at the end the stack is not empty, then the string is not balanced.
    Otherwise it is.

    ## Number of balanced sequences

    ### Formula

    The number of balanced bracket sequences with only one bracket type can be calculated using the [Catalan numbers](catalan-numbers.md).
    The number of balanced bracket sequences of length $2n$ ($n$ pairs of brackets) is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$$

    If we allow $k$ types of brackets, then each pair be of any of the $k$ types (independently of the others), thus the number of balanced bracket sequences is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} k^n$$

    ### Dynamic programming

    On the other hand these numbers can be computed using **dynamic programming**.
    Let $d[n]$ be the number of regular bracket sequences with $n$ pairs of bracket.
    Note that in the first position there is always an opening bracket.
    And somewhere later is the corresponding closing bracket of the pair.
    It is clear that inside this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence, and similarly after this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence.
    So to compute $d[n]$, we will look at how many balanced sequences of $i$ pairs of brackets are inside this first bracket pair, and how many balanced sequences with $n-1-i$ pairs are after this pair.
    Consequently the formula has the form:

    $$d[n] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d[i] \cdot d[n-1-i]$$

    The initial value for this recurrence is $d[0] = 1$.

    ## Finding the lexicographical next balanced sequence

    Here we only consider the case with one valid bracket type.

    Given a balanced sequence, we have to find the next (in lexicographical order) balanced sequence.

    It should be obvious, that we have to find the rightmost opening bracket, which we can replace by a closing bracket without violation the condition, that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets up to this position.
    After replacing this position, we can fill the remaining part of the string with the lexicographically minimal one: i.e. first with as much opening brackets as possible, and then fill up the remaining positions with closing brackets.
    In other words we try to leave a long as possible prefix unchanged, and the suffix gets replaced by the lexicographically minimal one.

    To find this position, we can iterate over the character from right to left, and maintain the balance $\text{depth}$ of open and closing brackets.
    When we meet an opening brackets, we will decrement $\text{depth}$, and when we meet a closing bracket, we increase it.
    If we are at some point meet an opening bracket, and the balance after processing this symbol is positive, then we have found the rightmost position that we can change.
    We change the symbol, compute the number of opening and closing brackets that we have to add to the right side, and arrange them in the lexicographically minimal way.

    If we find do suitable position, then this sequence is already the maximal possible one, and there is no answer.

    ```{.cpp file=next_balanced_brackets_sequence}
    bool next_balanced_sequence(string & s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '(')
                depth--;
            else
                depth++;

            if (s[i] == '(' && depth > 0) {
                depth--;
                int open = (n - i - 1 - depth) / 2;
                int close = n - i - 1 - open;
                string next = s.substr(0, i) + ')' + string(open, '(') + string(close, ')');
                s.swap(next);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

[Summary]:
    In this task, I implemented a basic calculator that evaluates simple mathematical expressions containing integers, the plus (+) and minus (-) operators, parentheses, and spaces. The core concepts involved parsing the string, managing operator precedence, and handling parentheses using a stack-based approach.

    The solution involved iterating through the characters of the input string, building numbers, and managing operations based on the last encountered operator. When encountering parentheses, I pushed the current operator onto a stack and evaluated the expression inside the parentheses when a closing parenthesis was found. The final result was computed by summing the values in the number stack.

    The implemented code successfully handled various test cases, including those with nested parentheses and different operator placements. The approach effectively utilized stacks to maintain the order of operations and ensure correct evaluation without using built-in evaluation functions. 

    Key takeaways include the importance of managing state (current number and last operator) and the utility of stacks for handling nested structures like parentheses. The solution was efficient and straightforward, demonstrating a clear understanding of basic parsing and evaluation techniques.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The problem involved decoding a string formatted with patterns like `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string`. The solution required parsing the string while managing nested structures, which is a common pattern in problems involving brackets.

    The approach utilized a stack to keep track of the current string and the repeat count. As we iterated through the string, we built numbers for repeat counts, pushed the current state onto the stack when encountering `[`, and popped from the stack to construct the final string when encountering `]`. This method effectively handled nested encodings.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. Key concepts included managing state with a stack and handling string concatenation efficiently. The solution demonstrated the importance of careful parsing and state management in problems involving nested structures. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
            stack = []
            current_string = ""
            number = 0
        
            for char in s:
                if char.isdigit():
                    number = number * 10 + int(char)
                elif char == '[':
                    stack.append((current_string, number))
                    current_string = ""
                    number = 0
                elif char == ']':
                    last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()
                    current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count
                else:
                    current_string += char
        
            return current_string
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the utility of stacks in managing nested structures and the importance of careful iteration and state management in string manipulation tasks.
