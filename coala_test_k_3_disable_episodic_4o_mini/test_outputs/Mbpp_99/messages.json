The function needed to support bases from 2 to 36 and format the output correctly as a string.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Base Conversion**: The core concept involved repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders to form the digits in the new base.\n    - **Handling Decimals**: For fractional parts, the approach involved multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting the integer part as the next digit.\n\n    ### Issues Encountered:\n    1. **Integer Conversion Logic**: The initial implementation failed to correctly convert integers to the specified base, leading to incorrect outputs for several test cases. The remainders were not being calculated or collected properly.\n    2. **Fractional Part Handling**: The logic for converting the fractional part was also flawed, resulting in incorrect decimal outputs.\n    3. **Output Formatting**: The formatting for zero and decimal places was incorrect, leading to unexpected results.\n\n    ### Strategies That Worked:\n    - The use of lists to collect digits and then reversing them for the final output was a good approach, but it needed to be applied correctly.\n    - Ensuring that the function could handle negative numbers and zero was crucial for comprehensive functionality.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    Here\u2019s the final version of the function that was intended to address the issues:\n\n    ```python\n    def converter(n, decimals=0, base=3.141592653589793):\n        if n == 0:\n            return \"0\" + (\".0\" * decimals if decimals > 0 else \"\")\n    \n        if n < 0:\n            sign = \"-\"\n            n = -n\n        else:\n            sign = \"\"\n    \n        integer_part = int(n)\n        fractional_part = n - integer_part\n    \n        digits = []\n        while integer_part > 0:\n            remainder = int(integer_part % base)\n            if remainder >= 10:\n                digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('A')))\n            else:\n                digits.append(str(remainder))\n            integer_part = int(integer_part // base)\n    \n        integer_result = ''.join(reversed(digits)) if digits else \"0\"\n    \n        if decimals > 0:\n            fractional_digits = []\n            while decimals > 0:\n                fractional_part *= base\n                fractional_digit = int(fractional_part)\n                if fractional_digit >= 10:\n                    fractional_digits.append(chr(fractional_digit - 10 + ord('A')))\n                else:\n                    fractional_digits.append(str(fractional_digit))\n                fractional_part -= fractional_digit\n                decimals -= 1\n        \n            fractional_result = ''.join(fractional_digits)\n            return sign + integer_result + \".\" + fractional_result\n    \n        return sign + integer_result\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    The experience highlighted the importance of carefully implementing base conversion logic and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts are handled correctly. Future attempts should focus on validating the conversion process with a wider range of test cases to ensure robustness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved transforming an integer `n` into zero using the minimum number of operations, specifically by manipulating its binary representation. The key operations allowed were flipping the rightmost bit and flipping a specific bit based on the state of adjacent bits.\n\n    The solution utilized a loop to repeatedly find and flip the rightmost 1 bit in the binary representation of `n`. Each operation was counted until `n` reached zero. The approach was straightforward, leveraging bitwise operations to efficiently determine the bits to manipulate.\n\n    One important aspect was ensuring that the second operation was only performed if there were still bits left to flip. The solution passed the provided test cases, including edge cases like `n = 0`, which required no operations. Overall, the experience reinforced the utility of bitwise operations in solving problems related to binary representations and operations on integers. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n            if n == 0:\n                return 0\n        \n            count = 0\n        \n            while n > 0:\n                count += 1\n                rightmost_one = n & -n\n                n ^= rightmost_one\n            \n                if n > 0:\n                    next_bit = rightmost_one << 1\n                    n ^= next_bit\n        \n            return count\n    ``` \n\n    This solution effectively captures the necessary logic to minimize operations while transforming `n` to zero.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involves reducing a positive integer `n` to `1` using a minimum number of operations, where the operations depend on whether `n` is even or odd. The core concepts tested here include recursion and decision-making based on the parity of the number. \n\n    The solution was implemented using a recursive approach, where the function checks if `n` is even or odd. If even, it divides `n` by `2` and counts that as one operation. If odd, it explores both options (adding or subtracting `1`) and takes the minimum of the two results. This approach effectively captures the necessary operations to reach `1`.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the recursive strategy is effective for this problem. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution was efficient for the given constraints. The recursive nature of the solution allows for clear logic flow, although it could be optimized further using memoization to avoid redundant calculations in larger inputs. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            if n == 1:\n                return 0\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                return 1 + self.integerReplacement(n // 2)\n            else:\n                return 1 + min(self.integerReplacement(n + 1), self.integerReplacement(n - 1))\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
