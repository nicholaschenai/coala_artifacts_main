    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a decimal (base 10) integer and converts it into its binary (base 2) representation. The output should be a string that represents the binary number without any leading zeros.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To convert a decimal number to binary, we can repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary representation is formed by reading these remainders in reverse order. If the input number is 0, the binary representation should simply be \"0\".\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function decimal_to_binary(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return \"0\"\n       initialize an empty list to store remainders\n       while n > 0:\n           remainder = n % 2\n           add remainder to the list\n           n = n // 2\n       reverse the list of remainders\n       convert the list to a string and return it\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    # Check if the input number is 0\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"  # The binary representation of 0 is \"0\"\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the binary digits\n    binary_digits = []\n    \n    # Loop until n becomes 0\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % 2  # Get the remainder when n is divided by 2\n        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))  # Store the remainder as a string\n        n = n // 2  # Update n to be the quotient of n divided by 2\n    \n    # Reverse the list of binary digits to get the correct order\n    binary_digits.reverse()\n    \n    # Join the list into a single string and return it\n    return ''.join(binary_digits)\n```",
