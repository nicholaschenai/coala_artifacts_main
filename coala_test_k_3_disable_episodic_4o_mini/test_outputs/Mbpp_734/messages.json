The key steps included generating all subarray sums, sorting them, and then summing the elements between specified indices.\n\n    The solution effectively utilized nested loops to compute the subarray sums, which were then sorted. The final sum was calculated by iterating over the specified range of indices. The implementation was straightforward and adhered to the constraints provided, ensuring that the result was returned modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n    One important takeaway is the efficiency of generating subarray sums using a cumulative approach, where the current sum is updated as we extend the subarray. This method avoids recalculating sums from scratch, making it more efficient. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def rangeSum(self, nums: list[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n            subarray_sums = []\n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n            subarray_sums.sort()\n            total_sum = 0\n            for index in range(left - 1, right):\n                total_sum += subarray_sums[index]\n            return total_sum % (10**9 + 7)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data structures to achieve the desired results.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of counting continuous subarrays whose sum equals a given integer `k`, I initially implemented a solution using a cumulative sum and a hashmap to track the frequencies of cumulative sums encountered. The core concept was to check if the difference between the current cumulative sum and `k` had been seen before, which would indicate the presence of a valid subarray.\n\n    However, the initial implementation had a flaw in the order of operations, leading to incorrect counts due to potential double counting of overlapping subarrays. The key insight was to ensure that the hashmap was updated after checking for the count of valid subarrays. This adjustment allowed the solution to correctly count only the valid subarrays that end at the current index.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def subarraySum(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n            cumulative_sum_count = {0: 1}  # To handle the case when cumulative sum equals k\n            cumulative_sum = 0\n            count = 0\n\n            for num in nums:\n                cumulative_sum += num\n            \n                if (cumulative_sum - k) in cumulative_sum_count:\n                    count += cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum - k]\n            \n                if cumulative_sum in cumulative_sum_count:\n                    cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum] += 1\n                else:\n                    cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum] = 1\n        \n            return count\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing state updates in algorithms that rely on cumulative calculations and hashmaps, particularly in avoiding double counting scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum at least \\( K \\). The solution involved using a sliding window technique combined with prefix sums to efficiently track the sums of subarrays.\n\n    The core concept was to maintain a running sum while iterating through the array. By calculating prefix sums, we could quickly determine the sum of any subarray. The strategy involved expanding the right pointer to include more elements and contracting the left pointer to minimize the length of valid subarrays when the sum condition was met.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the requirements and passed the provided test cases. The use of prefix sums allowed for efficient sum calculations, and the sliding window approach ensured that we explored all potential subarrays without unnecessary recalculations. This method proved effective for the problem constraints, demonstrating a clear pattern for solving similar problems involving subarray sums. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def shortestSubarray(self, A: list[int], K: int) -> int:\n            n = len(A)\n            min_length = float('inf')  # Initialize minimum length as infinity\n            current_sum = 0  # Initialize current sum\n            left = 0  # Initialize left pointer\n            prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)  # Create a prefix sum array\n\n            # Calculate prefix sums\n            for i in range(n):\n                prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + A[i]\n\n            # Iterate through the prefix sums\n            for right in range(1, n + 1):\n                current_sum = prefix_sums[right]  # Current sum is the prefix sum at right\n            \n                # Check if we can find a valid subarray\n                while left < right and current_sum - prefix_sums[left] >= K:\n                    min_length = min(min_length, right - left)  # Update minimum length\n                    left += 1  # Move left pointer to the right\n\n            # Return the result\n            return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding prefix sums and sliding window techniques for efficiently solving subarray problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
