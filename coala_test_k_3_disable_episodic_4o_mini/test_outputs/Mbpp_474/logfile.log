INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/474 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string and replaces all occurrences of a specified character with another character.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we will check if it matches the character we want to replace. If it does, we will add the new character to our result; if it doesn't, we will add the original character. Finally, we will join all the characters together to form the new string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function replace_char(input_string, char_to_replace, new_char):
       create an empty list to hold the result
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is equal to char_to_replace:
               append new_char to the result list
           else:
               append character to the result list
       join the result list into a string
       return the new string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def replace_char(input_string: str, char_to_replace: str, new_char: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty list to hold the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character matches the one to replace
        if char == char_to_replace:
            # Append the new character to the result list
            result.append(new_char)
        else:
            # Append the original character to the result list
            result.append(char)
    
    # Join the result list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(result)

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. 

    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach of generating all possible strings by removing and reinserting characters was effective, and the use of comparisons to track the smallest string worked as intended.

    The final implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each string, and outputting the results. The code was structured to first define the main function and then handle input/output, ensuring clarity and separation of logic. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. 

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    for i in range(N):  # Iterate through each character
        char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to move
        remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remove the character
        for j in range(N):  # Try to insert the character at every position
            new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]
            if new_string < smallest_string:  # Check if the new string is smaller
                smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of string manipulation techniques and careful iteration when solving combinatorial problems.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ```
