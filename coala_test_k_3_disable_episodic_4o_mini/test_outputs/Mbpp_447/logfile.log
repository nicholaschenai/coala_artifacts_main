[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to compute the sum of squares of specific terms in the Golomb sequence for multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \(10^{10}\)). The key was to efficiently compute the sequence using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

    The approach involved defining a function to compute the Golomb number using a memoization dictionary to store previously computed values. This significantly reduced the time complexity for repeated calls. The sum of squares was calculated by iterating through the specified range for each test case and accumulating the squares of the Golomb numbers.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output efficiently, ensuring that results were printed in bulk to minimize I/O overhead. The code passed all provided test cases, demonstrating that the memoization strategy effectively addressed the problem's constraints.

    Key code snippets:
    ```python
    def golomb(n, memo):
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        memo[n] = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1, memo), memo), memo)
        return memo[n]

    def sum_of_squares(L, R, memo):
        total = 0
        for i in range(L, R + 1):
            g_i = golomb(i, memo)
            total += g_i * g_i
        return total % (10**9 + 7)
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems and highlighted the need for efficient input/output handling in competitive programming scenarios.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to find the number of ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). The solution involved a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the valid combinations without repeating calculations.

    The core concept tested here was the use of recursion to explore combinations while ensuring uniqueness of integers. The recursive function `countWays` was designed to track the current sum and the last integer used, preventing the reuse of integers. Memoization was implemented to store previously computed results for specific states, which significantly improved performance.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, reading multiple test cases and producing the correct results. The code was structured to first define helper functions and then the main function, adhering to the specified format. Overall, the approach was effective, and the solution passed all provided test cases without errors. 

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    def countWays(N, K, current, last, memo):
        # Base case: if current sum equals N, we found a valid way
        if current == N:
            return 1
        # If current sum exceeds N, this path is invalid
        if current > N:
            return 0
        # Check if the result is already computed
        if (current, last) in memo:
            return memo[(current, last)]
    
        totalWays = 0
        # Start from the next integer after 'last'
        for i in range(last + 1, N + 1):
            totalWays += countWays(N, K, current + i**K, i, memo)
    
        # Store the result in memoization dictionary
        memo[(current, last)] = totalWays
        return totalWays
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of recursion and memoization in solving combinatorial problems efficiently.
