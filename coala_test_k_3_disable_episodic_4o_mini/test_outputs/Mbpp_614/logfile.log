INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/614 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains integers, and our goal is to calculate the total sum of all the integers present in these tuples.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, we will then iterate through its elements and add them to a cumulative total. Finally, we will return this total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function cummulative_sum(tuple_list):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for each tuple in tuple_list:
           for each number in tuple:
               add number to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def cummulative_sum(tuple_list):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for tup in tuple_list:
        # Iterate through each number in the current tuple
        for number in tup:
            # Add the number to the total sum
            total_sum += number
            
    # Return the cumulative sum
    return total_sum

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, including only every Kth Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.

    The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. 

    The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. 

    Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. 

    Here’s the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

    def S(N, K):
        sum_fib = 0
        for i in range(0, N + 1):
            if i % K == 0:
                sum_fib += fibonacci(i)
        return sum_fib
    ``` 

    Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():

            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0

        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.

                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/614 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input and calculates the total sum of all the numbers contained within those tuples.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each tuple in the list, and for each tuple, we will iterate through its elements to accumulate their sum. Finally, we will return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function cumulative_sum(tuple_list):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for each tuple in tuple_list:
           for each number in tuple:
               add number to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def cumulative_sum(tuple_list):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for tup in tuple_list:
        # Iterate through each number in the current tuple
        for num in tup:
            # Add the number to the total sum
            total_sum += num
            
    # Return the total sum
    return total_sum
```
