    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of nested lists (lists within a list) and finds the elements that are common across all these nested lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the common elements, we can start by taking the first nested list and treating it as a set of potential common elements. Then, we will iterate through the remaining nested lists, updating our set of common elements by retaining only those that are also present in each subsequent list. At the end of this process, the set will contain only the elements that are common to all nested lists.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n       if nested_lists is empty:\n           return empty set\n       \n       initialize common_elements as the set of the first list in nested_lists\n       \n       for each list in nested_lists starting from the second list:\n           update common_elements to be the intersection of common_elements and the current list\n       \n       return common_elements\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not nested_lists:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize common_elements with the first list converted to a set\n    common_elements = set(nested_lists[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through the remaining lists\n    for lst in nested_lists[1:]:\n        # Update common_elements to keep only those elements that are also in the current list\n        common_elements.intersection_update(lst)\n    \n    # Return the common elements as a list\n    return list(common_elements)\n```",
