INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/85 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the surface area of a sphere given its radius. The function should return the surface area as a floating-point number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by the equation \( A = 4 \pi r^2 \), where \( A \) is the surface area and \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. We will use this formula in our function. We will also need to use the value of \( \pi \), which can be approximated as 3.141592653589793.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `surfacearea_sphere` that takes one parameter, `radius`.
   - Calculate the surface area using the formula \( A = 4 \times \pi \times (radius^2) \).
   - Return the calculated surface area.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

    # Define the value of pi
    pi = 3.141592653589793
    # Calculate the surface area using the formula A = 4 * pi * r^2
    surface_area = 4 * pi * (radius ** 2)
    # Return the calculated surface area

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine if a right-angled triangle could be formed with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). The solution involved using the properties of right triangles, specifically the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. 

    The approach was to derive a quadratic equation based on the relationship between the sides and the area, and then solve for the lengths of the legs of the triangle. The discriminant of the quadratic equation was crucial in determining whether valid triangle sides could be found. If the discriminant was negative, it indicated that no valid triangle could be formed.

    The final implementation successfully handled multiple test cases and formatted the output correctly. Key points included ensuring that the sides were sorted and that the output precision met the requirements. The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.

    Here’s the core function used to find the triangle:

    ```python
    def find_triangle(H, S):
        area_double = 2 * S
        discriminant = H**4 - 4 * (area_double**2)
    
        if discriminant < 0:
            return -1
    
        a1 = ((H**2 + discriminant**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        a2 = ((H**2 - discriminant**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5
        b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5
    
        sides1 = sorted([a1, b1, H])
        sides2 = sorted([a2, b2, H])
    
        if sides1[0] > 0 and sides1[1] > 0:
            return sides1
        if sides2[0] > 0 and sides2[1] > 0:
            return sides2
    
        return -1
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric properties and their mathematical implications in programming challenges.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides a more concise and efficient approach to solving the problem of finding the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

    1. **Discriminant Check**: The solution first checks if the expression \( (H^4 - 16S^2) \) is negative. If it is, it immediately outputs -1, indicating that a triangle cannot be formed. This is a crucial step to avoid unnecessary calculations when the conditions for forming a triangle are not met.

    2. **Calculating the Base and Height**: The solution uses a mathematical approach to derive the lengths of the triangle's legs (base \( B \) and height \( P \)). It calculates \( B \) using the formula:
       \[
       B = \frac{\sqrt{H^2 + \sqrt{H^4 - 16S^2}}}{\sqrt{2}}
       \]
       This formula effectively derives one leg of the triangle based on the hypotenuse and area.

    3. **Calculating the Other Leg**: The height \( P \) is calculated using the area:
       \[
       P = \frac{2S}{B}
       \]
       This ensures that the area condition is satisfied.

    4. **Output Formatting**: The solution ensures that the output is formatted to six decimal places, which is important for precision in floating-point arithmetic.

    5. **Sorting the Sides**: The solution checks which of the two legs \( B \) and \( P \) is larger and prints them in non-decreasing order along with the hypotenuse \( H \).

    Overall, the official solution is efficient and leverages mathematical properties effectively, reducing the complexity of the problem. My initial approach was more verbose and involved solving a quadratic equation, which, while valid, was not as direct or efficient as the method used in the official solution. The official solution's use of direct calculations and checks for feasibility before proceeding with further calculations is a valuable lesson in optimizing problem-solving strategies.

    Chapter: Geometry
    Section: Polygon area
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Polygon area}

    A general formula for calculating the area
    of a polygon, sometimes called the \key{shoelace formula},
    is as follows: \index{shoelace formula}
    \[\frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (p_i \times p_{i+1})| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|, \]
    Here the vertices are
    $p_1=(x_1,y_1)$, $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$, $\ldots$, $p_n=(x_n,y_n)$
    in such an order that
    $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ are adjacent vertices on the boundary
    of the polygon,
    and the first and last vertex is the same, i.e., $p_1=p_n$.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is
    \[\frac{|(2\cdot5-5\cdot4)+(5\cdot3-7\cdot5)+(7\cdot1-4\cdot3)+(4\cdot3-4\cdot1)+(4\cdot4-2\cdot3)|}{2} = 17/2.\]

    The idea of the formula is to go through trapezoids
    whose one side is a side of the polygon,
    and another side lies on the horizontal line $y=0$.
    For example:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \path[draw,fill=lightgray] (5,5.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (7,0) -- (5,0) -- (5,5.4);
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \draw (0,0) -- (10,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    The area of such a trapezoid is
    \[(x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2},\]
    where the vertices of the polygon are $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$.
    If $x_{i+1}>x_{i}$, the area is positive,
    and if $x_{i+1}<x_{i}$, the area is negative.

    The area of the polygon is the sum of areas of
    all such trapezoids, which yields the formula
    \[|\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2}| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|.\]

    Note that the absolute value of the sum is taken,
    because the value of the sum may be positive or negative,
    depending on whether we walk clockwise or counterclockwise
    along the boundary of the polygon.

    \subsubsection{Pick's theorem}

    \index{Pick's theorem}

    \key{Pick's theorem} provides another way to calculate
    the area of a polygon provided that all vertices 
    of the polygon have integer coordinates.
    According to Pick's theorem, the area of the polygon is
    \[ a + b/2 -1,\]
    where $a$ is the number of integer points inside the polygon
    and $b$ is the number of integer points on the boundary of the polygon.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);

    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (3,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,4.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,2.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,2.4) circle (2pt);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is $6+7/2-1=17/2$.
