    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to write a function that takes an integer `n` and sets the leftmost unset bit (0) in its binary representation to 1. The output should be the new integer after this modification.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to identify the leftmost unset bit in the binary representation of `n`. We can do this by continuously shifting the bits of `n` to the right until we find a 0. Once we find the leftmost unset bit, we can set it to 1 by using a bitwise OR operation with a value that has only that bit set.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function set_left_most_unset_bit(n):\n       Initialize a variable position to 0\n       Initialize a variable mask to 1\n       \n       while n is not 0:\n           if (n & mask) is 0:\n               break\n           Increment position\n           Shift mask left by 1 (mask = mask << 1)\n           Shift n right by 1 (n = n >> 1)\n       \n       Set the leftmost unset bit by using (1 << position)\n       Return the result of (original n | (1 << position))\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n: int) -> int:\n    position = 0  # To track the position of the leftmost unset bit\n    mask = 1      # Start with the least significant bit\n\n    # Loop to find the leftmost unset bit\n    while n != 0:\n        if (n & mask) == 0:  # Check if the current bit is unset\n            break\n        position += 1        # Move to the next bit position\n        mask <<= 1           # Shift mask left to check the next bit\n        n >>= 1              # Shift n right to check the next bit\n\n    # Set the leftmost unset bit\n    return n | (1 << position)  # Return the new number with the bit set\n```",
