This solution correctly identifies the leftmost unset bit without modifying `n` during the process.\n\n```python\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n: int) -> int:\n    position = 0  # To track the position of the leftmost unset bit\n    mask = 1      # Start with the least significant bit\n\n    # Find the leftmost unset bit\n    while mask <= n:  # Continue until the mask exceeds n\n        if (n & mask) == 0:  # Check if the current bit is unset\n            break\n        position += 1  # Move to the next bit position\n        mask <<= 1      # Shift mask left to check the next bit\n\n    # Set the leftmost unset bit\n    return n | (1 << position)  # Return the new number with the bit set\n``` \n\nThis code will correctly find the leftmost unset bit in the binary representation of `n` and set it to 1, returning the modified integer.",
