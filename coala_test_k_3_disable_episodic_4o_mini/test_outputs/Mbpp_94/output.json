    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find the first element of a tuple that has the smallest second element from a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of a name (string) and a score (integer).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list of tuples, compare the second elements (scores) of each tuple, and keep track of the tuple with the smallest score. Once we find the tuple with the smallest score, we will return the first element (name) of that tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function index_minimum(tuples):\n       initialize min_value to infinity\n       initialize min_name to empty string\n       \n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           if the second element of the tuple is less than min_value:\n               update min_value to the second element of the tuple\n               update min_name to the first element of the tuple\n       \n       return min_name\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef index_minimum(tuples):\n    # Initialize min_value to a very large number\n    min_value = float('inf')\n    # Initialize min_name to an empty string\n    min_name = ''\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for name, score in tuples:\n        # If the current score is less than the minimum found so far\n        if score < min_value:\n            # Update the minimum score and corresponding name\n            min_value = score\n            min_name = name\n            \n    # Return the name associated with the smallest score\n    return min_name\n```",
