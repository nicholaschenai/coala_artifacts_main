    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that identifies the number that appears most frequently in a given list. If there are multiple numbers with the same highest frequency, the function should return the first one that reaches that frequency.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count how many times each number appears in the list. After counting, we will determine which number has the highest count. If there are ties, we will return the first number that reached that maximum count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_occurrences(numbers):\n       create an empty dictionary to count occurrences\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is in the dictionary:\n               increment its count\n           else:\n               set its count to 1\n       \n       initialize max_count to 0 and result_number to None\n       for each number and its count in the dictionary:\n           if count is greater than max_count:\n               update max_count to count\n               update result_number to number\n       \n       return result_number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_occurrences(numbers):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each number\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count each number's occurrences\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number in count_dict:\n            count_dict[number] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[number] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum count and the result number\n    max_count = 0\n    result_number = None\n    \n    # Determine the number with the maximum occurrences\n    for number, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count > max_count:\n            max_count = count\n            result_number = number\n    \n    # Return the number with the maximum occurrences\n    return result_number\n```",
