The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.\n\n    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.\n\n    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def largest_prime_factor(n):\n        largest_prime = 1\n        while n % 2 == 0:\n            largest_prime = 2\n            n //= 2\n        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n            while n % i == 0:\n                largest_prime = i\n                n //= i\n        if n > 2:\n            largest_prime = n\n        return largest_prime\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        index = 1\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n            index += 1\n        \n            prime_count = {}\n        \n            for number in elements:\n                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)\n                if largest_prime in prime_count:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1\n                else:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1\n        \n            max_count = -1\n            result_prime = -1\n        \n            for prime, count in prime_count.items():\n                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result_prime):\n                    max_count = count\n                    result_prime = prime\n        \n            results.append(result_prime)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead achieved by either player at the end of any round, rather than simply summing their scores. The problem required careful tracking of cumulative scores and leads after each round.\n\n    The solution involved reading the number of rounds and the scores for each player, updating cumulative scores, and calculating the lead for each round. The maximum lead and the corresponding winner were tracked throughout the rounds. The implementation was straightforward, leveraging basic arithmetic and conditional statements to determine the leader and maximum lead.\n\n    The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and it passed the provided test case without any issues. Key concepts included cumulative score tracking, lead calculation, and conditional logic to determine the winner based on maximum lead. This experience reinforced the importance of maintaining state across iterations and the need for clear logic when comparing values. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_winner():\n        N = int(input())\n        cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n        cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n        max_lead = 0\n        winner = 0\n\n        for _ in range(N):\n            S1, S2 = map(int, input().split())\n            cumulative_score_player1 += S1\n            cumulative_score_player2 += S2\n        \n            if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n                lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2\n                if lead > max_lead:\n                    max_lead = lead\n                    winner = 1\n            else:\n                lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1\n                if lead > max_lead:\n                    max_lead = lead\n                    winner = 2\n\n        print(winner, max_lead)\n\n    find_winner()\n    ``` \n\n    This solution effectively meets the problem's requirements and demonstrates a clear understanding of the necessary logic and data handling.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
