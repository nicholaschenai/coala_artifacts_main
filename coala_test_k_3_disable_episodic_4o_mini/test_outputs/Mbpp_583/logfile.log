INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/583 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the nth Catalan number. The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics. The 10th Catalan number should equal 16796.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The nth Catalan number can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   C(n) = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!}
   \]
   This means we need to compute the factorial of numbers, specifically for \(2n\), \(n+1\), and \(n\). We can create a helper function to compute the factorial, and then use it to calculate the nth Catalan number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION factorial(n):
       IF n == 0 OR n == 1:
           RETURN 1
       ELSE:
           RETURN n * factorial(n - 1)

   FUNCTION catalan_number(n):
       C_n = factorial(2 * n) / (factorial(n + 1) * factorial(n))
       RETURN C_n
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Function to calculate factorial of a number
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Function to calculate the nth Catalan number
def catalan_number(n):
    # Calculate the nth Catalan number using the formula
    C_n = factorial(2 * n) // (factorial(n + 1) * factorial(n))
    return C_n

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

    Title: Catalan Numbers
    Part: 1/1
    # Catalan Numbers
    Catalan numbers is a number sequence, which is found useful in a number of combinatorial problems, often involving recursively-defined objects.

    This sequence was named after the Belgian mathematician [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan), who lived in the 19th century. (In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).

    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):

     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \ldots$

    ### Application in some combinatorial problems

    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for

    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.
    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.
    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.
    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).
    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.
    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).
    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).
    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).
    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.
    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).


    ## Calculations

    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.

    ### Recursive formula
 
    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$

    $$C_n = \sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \geq 2$$

    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.

    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.

    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :

    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.

    #### C++ implementation 

    ```cpp
    const int MOD = ....
    const int MAX = ....
    int catalan[MAX];
    void init() {
        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;
        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {
            catalan[i] = 0;
            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {
                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;
                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {
                    catalan[i] -= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Analytical formula

    $$C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1} {\binom{2n}{n}}$$

    (here $\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).

    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \times n$ is given by $\binom{2n}{n}$.

    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \times n$.

    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$ are $\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as "bad" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above "bad" paths, obtaining the formula:

    $$C_n = \binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n + 1} \binom{2n}{n} , {n} \geq 0$$

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, including only every Kth Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.

    The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. 

    The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. 

    Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. 

    Here’s the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

    def S(N, K):
        sum_fib = 0
        for i in range(0, N + 1):
            if i % K == 0:
                sum_fib += fibonacci(i)
        return sum_fib
    ``` 

    Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.
