    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and removes all characters that are located at odd indices (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) in the string. The result should be a new string containing only the characters from even indices.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and check the index of each character. If the index is even, we will keep that character; if it is odd, we will skip it. Finally, we will join the kept characters to form the resulting string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_odd(s):\n       create an empty list to hold the result\n       for index from 0 to length of s - 1:\n           if index is even:\n               append s[index] to the result list\n       return the joined result list as a string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef remove_odd(s: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty list to hold the characters at even indices\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the string using the index\n    for index in range(len(s)):\n        # Check if the index is even\n        if index % 2 == 0:\n            # Append the character at the even index to the result list\n            result.append(s[index])\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return it\n    return ''.join(result)\n```",
