The key steps included generating all subarray sums, sorting them, and then summing the elements between specified indices.\n\n    The solution effectively utilized nested loops to compute the subarray sums, which were then sorted. The final sum was calculated by iterating over the specified range of indices. The implementation was straightforward and adhered to the constraints provided, ensuring that the result was returned modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n    One important takeaway is the efficiency of generating subarray sums using a cumulative approach, where the current sum is updated as we extend the subarray. This method avoids recalculating sums from scratch, making it more efficient. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def rangeSum(self, nums: list[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n            subarray_sums = []\n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n            subarray_sums.sort()\n            total_sum = 0\n            for index in range(left - 1, right):\n                total_sum += subarray_sums[index]\n            return total_sum % (10**9 + 7)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data structures to achieve the desired results.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays containing exactly `k` odd numbers from a given list of integers. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving subarrays and counts.\n\n    The core concept involved maintaining a count of odd numbers within a window defined by two pointers (left and right). As the right pointer expanded the window, the odd count was updated. If the count exceeded `k`, the left pointer was incremented to reduce the count back to `k`. When the count matched `k`, the number of valid subarrays was calculated by counting the even numbers to the left of the current window.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the sliding window technique is suitable for this type of problem. The key takeaway is the importance of managing two pointers to dynamically adjust the window size while keeping track of specific conditions (in this case, the count of odd numbers). \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n            result = 0\n            left = 0\n            odd_count = 0\n        \n            for right in range(len(nums)):\n                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:\n                    odd_count += 1\n            \n                while odd_count > k:\n                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:\n                        odd_count -= 1\n                    left += 1\n            \n                if odd_count == k:\n                    temp_left = left\n                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:\n                        temp_left += 1\n                    result += (temp_left - left + 1)\n        \n            return result\n    ``` \n\n    This approach effectively counts the desired subarrays while maintaining a linear time complexity, making it suitable for larger input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum at least \\( K \\). The solution involved using a sliding window technique combined with prefix sums to efficiently track the sums of subarrays.\n\n    The core concept was to maintain a running sum while iterating through the array. By calculating prefix sums, we could quickly determine the sum of any subarray. The strategy involved expanding the right pointer to include more elements and contracting the left pointer to minimize the length of valid subarrays when the sum condition was met.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the requirements and passed the provided test cases. The use of prefix sums allowed for efficient sum calculations, and the sliding window approach ensured that we explored all potential subarrays without unnecessary recalculations. This method proved effective for the problem constraints, demonstrating a clear pattern for solving similar problems involving subarray sums. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def shortestSubarray(self, A: list[int], K: int) -> int:\n            n = len(A)\n            min_length = float('inf')  # Initialize minimum length as infinity\n            current_sum = 0  # Initialize current sum\n            left = 0  # Initialize left pointer\n            prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)  # Create a prefix sum array\n\n            # Calculate prefix sums\n            for i in range(n):\n                prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + A[i]\n\n            # Iterate through the prefix sums\n            for right in range(1, n + 1):\n                current_sum = prefix_sums[right]  # Current sum is the prefix sum at right\n            \n                # Check if we can find a valid subarray\n                while left < right and current_sum - prefix_sums[left] >= K:\n                    min_length = min(min_length, right - left)  # Update minimum length\n                    left += 1  # Move left pointer to the right\n\n            # Return the result\n            return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding prefix sums and sliding window techniques for efficiently solving subarray problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
