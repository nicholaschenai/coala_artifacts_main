    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list into two parts at the `n`th index. The first part of the list should then be moved to the end of the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Identify the first part of the list, which consists of elements from the start of the list up to the `n`th index (not inclusive).\n   - Identify the second part of the list, which consists of the elements from the `n`th index to the end of the list.\n   - Concatenate the second part with the first part to form the new list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function split_Arr(arr, n):\n       first_part = arr[0:n]  // Get elements from start to n (exclusive)\n       second_part = arr[n:]   // Get elements from n to end\n       return second_part + first_part  // Concatenate second part with first part\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef split_Arr(arr, n):\n    # Get the first part of the list from index 0 to n (exclusive)\n    first_part = arr[0:n]\n    # Get the second part of the list from index n to the end\n    second_part = arr[n:]\n    # Concatenate the second part with the first part and return\n    return second_part + first_part\n```",
