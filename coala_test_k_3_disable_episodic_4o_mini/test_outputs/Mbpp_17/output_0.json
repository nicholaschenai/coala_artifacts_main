    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a square when given the length of one of its sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The perimeter of a square can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4, since a square has four equal sides. Therefore, if we have the side length, we can easily compute the perimeter.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION square_perimeter(side_length):\n       PERIMETER = side_length * 4\n       RETURN PERIMETER\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the perimeter of a square\ndef square_perimeter(side_length):\n    # Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 4\n    perimeter = side_length * 4\n    # Return the calculated perimeter\n    return perimeter\n```",
