The solution utilized a dynamic programming approach, which is a common strategy for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index, updating it based on previous elements.\n\n    The implemented algorithm iterated through the input array, comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length of the subsequence was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by taking the maximum value from the array that tracked the lengths.\n\n    The code snippet for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            d = [1] * len(nums)\n        \n            for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This approach runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem constraints. The solution was successful, passing all tests, indicating that the dynamic programming strategy was effective in this case. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.\n\n    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.\n\n    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def largest_prime_factor(n):\n        largest_prime = 1\n        while n % 2 == 0:\n            largest_prime = 2\n            n //= 2\n        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n            while n % i == 0:\n                largest_prime = i\n                n //= i\n        if n > 2:\n            largest_prime = n\n        return largest_prime\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        index = 1\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n            index += 1\n        \n            prime_count = {}\n        \n            for number in elements:\n                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)\n                if largest_prime in prime_count:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1\n                else:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1\n        \n            max_count = -1\n            result_prime = -1\n        \n            for prime, count in prime_count.items():\n                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result_prime):\n                    max_count = count\n                    result_prime = prime\n        \n            results.append(result_prime)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead achieved by either player at the end of any round, rather than simply summing their scores. The problem required careful tracking of cumulative scores and leads after each round.\n\n    The solution involved reading the number of rounds and the scores for each player, updating cumulative scores, and calculating the lead for each round. The maximum lead and the corresponding winner were tracked throughout the rounds. The implementation was straightforward, leveraging basic arithmetic and conditional statements to determine the leader and maximum lead.\n\n    The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and it passed the provided test case without any issues. Key concepts included cumulative score tracking, lead calculation, and conditional logic to determine the winner based on maximum lead. This experience reinforced the importance of maintaining state across iterations and the need for clear logic when comparing values. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_winner():\n        N = int(input())\n        cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n        cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n        max_lead = 0\n        winner = 0\n\n        for _ in range(N):\n            S1, S2 = map(int, input().split())\n            cumulative_score_player1 += S1\n            cumulative_score_player2 += S2\n        \n            if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n                lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2\n                if lead > max_lead:\n                    max_lead = lead\n                    winner = 1\n            else:\n                lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1\n                if lead > max_lead:\n                    max_lead = lead\n                    winner = 2\n\n        print(winner, max_lead)\n\n    find_winner()\n    ``` \n\n    This solution effectively meets the problem's requirements and demonstrates a clear understanding of the necessary logic and data handling.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
