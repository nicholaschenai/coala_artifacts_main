INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/261 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. Each tuple contains numbers, and we want to divide the corresponding elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple. The result should be a new tuple containing the results of these divisions.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Create a function that accepts two tuples.
   - Iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements, perform the division of the first element by the second.
   - Collect the results of these divisions into a new tuple.
   - Return the new tuple as the output.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
       create an empty list to store results
       for each index in range of length of tuple1:
           divide element at index of tuple1 by element at index of tuple2
           append the result to the results list
       convert results list to a tuple
       return the tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Create an empty list to store results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Divide the element of the first tuple by the element of the second tuple
        result = tuple1[i] // tuple2[i]  # Using integer division
        # Append the result to the results list
        results.append(result)
    
    # Convert results list to a tuple
    return tuple(results)

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of p allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers A and B. The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.

    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.

    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. 

    Key code snippet for counting divisors:
    ```python
    def count_divisors(n):
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
        return count
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.

        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.

    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.

    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def largest_prime_factor(n):
        largest_prime = 1
        while n % 2 == 0:
            largest_prime = 2
            n //= 2
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            while n % i == 0:
                largest_prime = i
                n //= i
        if n > 2:
            largest_prime = n
        return largest_prime

                if largest_prime in prime_count:
                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1
                else:
