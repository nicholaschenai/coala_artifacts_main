The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.\n\n    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. \n\n    Key code snippet for counting divisors:\n    ```python\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Continued fractions\n    Part: 8/12\n    ```\n\n        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\\frac{x+y \\sqrt{n}}{z}$.\n\n    !!! example \"[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)\"\n        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square.

The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.\n\n    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.\n\n    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design.
