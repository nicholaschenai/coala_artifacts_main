    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes two tuples of numbers and divides the corresponding elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple, returning a new tuple with the results of these divisions.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We will iterate through both tuples simultaneously, performing division for each pair of elements (the first element of the first tuple divided by the first element of the second tuple, and so on). We will store the results in a new tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n       create an empty list to store results\n       for each index in the range of the length of tuple1:\n           divide the element at index of tuple1 by the element at index of tuple2\n           append the result to the results list\n       convert the results list to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Create an empty list to store results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through both tuples simultaneously\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Perform division for each pair of elements\n        result = tuple1[i] // tuple2[i]  # Use integer division\n        # Append the result to the results list\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Convert the results list to a tuple\n    return tuple(results)\n\n# The function division_elements is declared last as per the instructions.\n```",
