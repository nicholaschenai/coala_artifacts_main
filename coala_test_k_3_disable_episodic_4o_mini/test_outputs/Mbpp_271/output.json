    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes an integer `n` and calculates the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, each raised to the fifth power.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. The first `n` even natural numbers can be generated by the formula `2 * i` where `i` ranges from `1` to `n`.\n   - Raise each of these even numbers to the fifth power.\n   - Sum all these fifth powers together to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function even_Power_Sum(n):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           even_number = 2 * i\n           fifth_power = even_number raised to the power of 5\n           total_sum += fifth_power\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef even_Power_Sum(n):\n    # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Loop through the first n even natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th even natural number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Raise the even number to the fifth power\n        fifth_power = even_number ** 5\n        # Add the fifth power to the total sum\n        total_sum += fifth_power\n    # Return the total sum of the fifth powers\n    return total_sum\n```",
