        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, each raised to the fifth power. For example, if `n` is 2, we should find the sum of the first two even natural numbers (2 and 4) raised to the fifth power.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum.\n   - Use a loop to iterate from 1 to `n` to generate the first `n` even natural numbers. The `k`-th even natural number can be calculated as `2 * k`.\n   - For each even number, raise it to the fifth power and add it to the sum.\n   - Finally, return the computed sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function even_Power_Sum(n):\n       sum = 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           even_number = 2 * i\n           sum += even_number raised to the power of 5\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef even_Power_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    sum = 0\n    # Loop through the first n natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th even natural number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Raise the even number to the fifth power and add to sum\n        sum += even_number ** 5\n    # Return the final sum\n    return sum\n```"

The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, including only every Kth Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.\n\n    The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. \n\n    The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def fibonacci(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\n    def S(N, K):\n        sum_fib = 0\n        for i in range(0, N + 1):\n            if i % K == 0:\n                sum_fib += fibonacci(i)\n        return sum_fib\n    ``` \n\n    Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to find the number of ways to express a natural number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \\( K \\). The solution involved a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the valid combinations without repeating calculations.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the use of recursion to explore combinations while ensuring uniqueness of integers. The recursive function `countWays` was designed to track the current sum and the last integer used, preventing the reuse of integers. Memoization was implemented to store previously computed results for specific states, which significantly improved performance.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, reading multiple test cases and producing the correct results. The code was structured to first define helper functions and then the main function, adhering to the specified format. Overall, the approach was effective, and the solution passed all provided test cases without errors. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countWays(N, K, current, last, memo):\n        # Base case: if current sum equals N, we found a valid way\n        if current == N:\n            return 1\n        # If current sum exceeds N, this path is invalid\n        if current > N:\n            return 0\n        # Check if the result is already computed\n        if (current, last) in memo:\n            return memo[(current, last)]\n    \n        totalWays = 0\n        # Start from the next integer after 'last'\n        for i in range(last + 1, N + 1):\n            totalWays += countWays(N, K, current + i**K, i, memo)\n    \n        # Store the result in memoization dictionary\n        memo[(current, last)] = totalWays\n        return totalWays\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recursion and memoization in solving combinatorial problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
