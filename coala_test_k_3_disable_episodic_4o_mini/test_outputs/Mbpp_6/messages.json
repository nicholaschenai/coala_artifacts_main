The key operations allowed were flipping the rightmost bit and flipping a specific bit based on the state of adjacent bits.\n\n    The solution utilized a loop to repeatedly find and flip the rightmost 1 bit in the binary representation of `n`. Each operation was counted until `n` reached zero. The approach was straightforward, leveraging bitwise operations to efficiently determine the bits to manipulate.\n\n    One important aspect was ensuring that the second operation was only performed if there were still bits left to flip. The solution passed the provided test cases, including edge cases like `n = 0`, which required no operations. Overall, the experience reinforced the utility of bitwise operations in solving problems related to binary representations and operations on integers. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n            if n == 0:\n                return 0\n        \n            count = 0\n        \n            while n > 0:\n                count += 1\n                rightmost_one = n & -n\n                n ^= rightmost_one\n            \n                if n > 0:\n                    next_bit = rightmost_one << 1\n                    n ^= next_bit\n        \n            return count\n    ``` \n\n    This solution effectively captures the necessary logic to minimize operations while transforming `n` to zero.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution provides a more efficient approach to solving the problem of transforming an integer `n` to zero using the minimum number of operations. The key insights from the official solution are as follows:\n\n    1. **Counting Bits**: The solution first counts the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of `n`. This is done using a while loop that checks the least significant bit (`m & 1`) and right shifts `m` until it becomes zero. This count (`s`) is crucial as it determines how many operations will be needed.\n\n    2. **Bit Manipulation**: The second part of the solution involves manipulating the bits of `n` based on the count of 1 bits. It uses a variable `k` to represent the current bit position being processed. The loop continues until all bits have been processed. The operations are performed by checking if the current bit in `n` is set and flipping it accordingly.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient because it directly manipulates the bits without unnecessary recursive calls or additional checks. It leverages bitwise operations, which are generally faster and more efficient than arithmetic operations.\n\n    In contrast, my initial approach involved a more complex recursive strategy that may not have effectively minimized the number of operations. The reliance on flipping bits based on conditions could lead to unnecessary operations, especially if the logic for determining which bits to flip was not optimal.\n\n    Overall, the official solution's method of counting bits and then systematically flipping them based on their positions is a clearer and more efficient way to tackle the problem. This experience highlights the importance of understanding bit manipulation techniques in solving problems related to binary representations.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Bit manipulation\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Bit manipulation\n\n    ## Binary number\n\n    A **binary number** is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, it is a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically \"0\" (zero) and \"1\" (one).\n\n    We say that a certain bit is **set**, if it is one, and **cleared** if it is zero.\n\n    The binary number $(a_k a_{k-1} \\dots a_1 a_0)_2$ represents the number:\n\n    $$(a_k a_{k-1} \\dots a_1 a_0)_2 = a_k \\cdot 2^k + a_{k-1} \\cdot 2^{k-1} + \\dots + a_1 \\cdot 2^1 + a_0 \\cdot 2^0.$$\n\n    For instance the binary number $1101_2$ represents the number $13$:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    1101_2 &= 1 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0 \\\\\n           &= 1\\cdot 8 + 1 \\cdot 4 + 0 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 13\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    Computers represent integers as binary numbers.\n    Positive integers (both signed and unsigned) are just represented with their binary digits, and negative signed numbers (which can be positive and negative) are usually represented with the [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).\n\n    ```cpp\n    unsigned int unsigned_number = 13;\n    assert(unsigned_number == 0b1101);\n\n    int positive_signed_number = 13;\n    assert(positive_signed_number == 0b1101);\n\n    int negative_signed_number = -13;\n    assert(negative_signed_number == 0b1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'0011);\n    ```\n\n    CPUs are very fast manipulating those bits with specific operations.\n    For some problems we can take these binary number representations to our advantage, and speed up the execution time.\n    And for some problems (typically in combinatorics or dynamic programming) where we want to track which objects we already picked from a given set of objects, we can just use an large enough integer where each digit represents an object and depending on if we pick or drop the object we set or clear the digit.\n\n    ## Bit operators\n\n    All those introduced operators are instant (same speed as an addition) on a CPU for fixed-length integers.\n\n    ### Bitwise operators\n\n    -   $\\&$ : The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand. \n        If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n \t\n    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.\n\n    Examples:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 01010000\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n | (n-1) = 01011111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    --------------------\n    ~n        = 10100111\n    ```\n\n    ### Shift operators\n\n    There are two operators for shifting bits.\n\n    -   $\\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.\n        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\gg 2 = 101_2 \\gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\\frac{5}{2^2} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1$.\n        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.\n\n    -   $\\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.\n        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\ll 3 = 101_2 \\ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \\cdot 2^3 = 5 \\cdot 8 = 40$.\n\n        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.\n\n\n    ## Useful tricks\n\n    ### Set/flip/clear a bit\n\n    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.\n    $1 \\ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\\sim(1 \\ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.\n\n    - $n ~|~ (1 \\ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\wedge~ (1 \\ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\&~ \\sim(1 \\ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n\n    ### Check if a bit is set\n\n    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {\n        return (number >> x) & 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2\n\n    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).\n    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.\n    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {\n        return n && !(n & (n - 1));\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Clear the most-right set bit\n\n    The expression $n ~\\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.\n    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.\n    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.\n\n    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 00110100\n    n-1       = 00110011\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 00110000\n    ```\n\n    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm\n\n    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.\n\n    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    int countSetBits(int n)\n    {\n        int count = 0;\n        while (n)\n        {\n            n = n & (n - 1);\n            count++;\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
