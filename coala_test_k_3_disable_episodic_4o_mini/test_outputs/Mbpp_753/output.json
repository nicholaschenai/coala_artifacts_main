    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a score. The function should return the minimum `k` records (tuples) based on the score, sorted in ascending order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Sort the list of tuples based on the score (the second element of each tuple).\n   - Select the first `k` tuples from the sorted list, as these will represent the minimum scores.\n   - Return this selection as the output.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_k(records, k):\n       sort records by the second element of each tuple (the score)\n       return the first k elements of the sorted list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_k(records, k):\n    # Step 1: Sort the records based on the score (second element of each tuple)\n    sorted_records = sorted(records, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    \n    # Step 2: Return the first k records from the sorted list\n    return sorted_records[:k]\n\n# The function min_k is declared last as per the instructions.\n```",
