    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that counts how many pairs of strings in a given list are reverse of each other. For example, if the list contains \"julia\" and \"ailuj\", they are considered a pair because one is the reverse of the other.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a set to keep track of the strings we have seen so far. For each string in the list, we will check if its reverse is already in the set. If it is, we have found a pair. We will also add the current string to the set for future checks. Finally, we will return the count of unique pairs found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_reverse_pairs(string_list):\n       create an empty set called seen\n       create a variable count and set it to 0\n       \n       for each string in string_list:\n           reverse_string = reverse the current string\n           if reverse_string is in seen:\n               increment count by 1\n           add the current string to seen\n       \n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_reverse_pairs(string_list):\n    # Create a set to keep track of seen strings\n    seen = set()\n    # Initialize the count of reverse pairs\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each string in the provided list\n    for string in string_list:\n        # Reverse the current string\n        reverse_string = string[::-1]\n        # Check if the reversed string is already in the seen set\n        if reverse_string in seen:\n            # If it is, we found a reverse pair, increment the count\n            count += 1\n        # Add the current string to the seen set\n        seen.add(string)\n    \n    # Return the total count of reverse pairs found\n    return count\n```",
