INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/757 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that counts how many pairs of strings in a given list are reverse of each other. For example, if one string is "abc", we should check if "cba" is also in the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will iterate through each string in the list.
   - For each string, we will check if its reverse exists in the list.
   - We need to ensure that we do not count the same pair twice, so we can keep track of the strings we have already counted.
   - We will maintain a count of the pairs found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function count_reverse_pairs(string_list):
       initialize a set to keep track of counted strings
       initialize a counter to zero
       for each string in string_list:
           if the string is not in counted strings:
               reverse the string
               if the reversed string is in string_list:
                   increment the counter
                   add both the string and its reverse to counted strings
       return the counter
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def count_reverse_pairs(string_list):
    # Initialize a set to keep track of counted strings
    counted = set()
    # Initialize a counter to zero
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each string in the list
    for string in string_list:
        # Check if the string has already been counted
        if string not in counted:
            # Reverse the string
            reversed_string = string[::-1]
            # Check if the reversed string is in the list
            if reversed_string in string_list:
                # Increment the counter
                count += 1
                # Add both the string and its reverse to counted
                counted.add(string)
                counted.add(reversed_string)

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.

    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of "abacaba". The logic needed to ensure that after placing "abacaba", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. Checking how many times "abacaba" already appeared in the string.
    2. Attempting to place "abacaba" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.
    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.
    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.

    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]
            s = case[1]
            modified_string = list(s)

            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            placed = False
            for i in range(n - 6):
                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):
                    temp_string = modified_string[:]
                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)
                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:
                        modified_string = temp_string
                        placed = True
                        break

            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)

            if final_count != 1:
                print("No")
            else:
                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)
                print("Yes")
                print("".join(modified_string))

    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != "abacaba"[j]:
                return False
        return True

    def place_abacaba(s, index):
        for j in range(7):
            s[index + j] = "abacaba"[j]

    def count_abacaba(s):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 6):
            if "".join(s[i:i + 7]) == "abacaba":
                count += 1
        return count

    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                s[i] = 'z'

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, s))

    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)
    ```

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the number of ways to remove a non-empty contiguous subsequence from a given sequence of integers such that the remaining sequence is non-empty and strictly increasing. The solution involved iterating through all possible contiguous subsequences to remove and checking if the remaining sequence met the strictly increasing condition.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate and evaluate subsequences efficiently. The approach involved two nested loops to consider all possible starting and ending indices for the subsequence to be removed. After forming the remaining sequence, a helper function was used to check if it was strictly increasing.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was straightforward. The helper function `is_strictly_increasing` was crucial for validating the remaining sequence. The solution was efficient enough given the constraints, but it could be optimized further for larger inputs by avoiding the creation of new lists for the remaining sequence.

    Here’s the key code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def is_strictly_increasing(sequence):
        for i in range(1, len(sequence)):
            if sequence[i] <= sequence[i - 1]:
                return False
        return True

    def count_ways_to_remove_subsequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
            count = 0
        
            for start in range(N):
                for end in range(start, N):
                    remaining_sequence = A[0:start] + A[end + 1:N]
                    if remaining_sequence and is_strictly_increasing(remaining_sequence):
                        count += 1
        
            print(count)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding subsequences and their properties, as well as the need for efficient checks when dealing with potentially large datasets.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/757 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that counts how many pairs of strings in a given list are reverse of each other. For example, if the list contains "julia" and "ailuj", they are considered a pair because one is the reverse of the other.
