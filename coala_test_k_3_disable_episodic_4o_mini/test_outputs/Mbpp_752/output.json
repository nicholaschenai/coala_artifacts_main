    "raw_msg": "Given the previous analysis and the insights from the memories, it seems that I have been incorrectly calculating the Jacobsthal numbers. The correct approach to compute the Jacobsthal sequence is to ensure that the recursive relationship is accurately implemented.\n\nThe Jacobsthal sequence is defined as follows:\n- Jacobsthal(0) = 0\n- Jacobsthal(1) = 1\n- For n >= 2: Jacobsthal(n) = Jacobsthal(n-2) + 2 * Jacobsthal(n-1)\n\nThe sequence starts as: 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171, 341, 683, 1365, 2731, ...\n\nThe previous implementations were not correctly following this recursive relationship. \n\n### Corrected Code\nHere\u2019s the corrected code that accurately computes the nth Jacobsthal number:\n\n```python\ndef jacobsthal_num(n):\n    # Base cases for the first two Jacobsthal numbers\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two Jacobsthal numbers\n    previous = 0  # Jacobsthal(0)\n    current = 1   # Jacobsthal(1)\n    \n    # Iteratively calculate the Jacobsthal numbers up to n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        next_value = previous + 2 * current  # Jacobsthal(n) = Jacobsthal(n-2) + 2 * Jacobsthal(n-1)\n        previous = current  # Move to the next number in the sequence\n        current = next_value  # Update current to the newly calculated value\n    \n    return current  # Return the nth Jacobsthal number\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n1. **Base Cases**: The function first checks for the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning the corresponding Jacobsthal numbers.\n2. **Initialization**: It initializes `previous` and `current` to represent the first two Jacobsthal numbers.\n3. **Iteration**: The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, calculating the next Jacobsthal number using the formula `next_value = previous + 2 * current`.\n4. **Updating Values**: After calculating the next value, it updates `previous` and `current` for the next iteration.\n5. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the `current` value, which represents the nth Jacobsthal number.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly compute the Jacobsthal numbers and pass the assertion `assert jacobsthal_num(5) == 11`.",
