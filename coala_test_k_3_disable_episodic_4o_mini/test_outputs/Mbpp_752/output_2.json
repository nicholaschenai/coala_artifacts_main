    "raw_msg": "Based on the previous analysis and the insights gained, it appears that the implementation of the Jacobsthal number calculation was incorrect. The Jacobsthal sequence is defined as follows:\n\n- Jacobsthal(0) = 0\n- Jacobsthal(1) = 1\n- For n >= 2: Jacobsthal(n) = Jacobsthal(n-2) + 2 * Jacobsthal(n-1)\n\nThe sequence starts as: 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171, 341, 683, 1365, 2731, ...\n\nThe previous implementation incorrectly calculated the Jacobsthal numbers. I will revise the code to ensure that it correctly follows the sequence definition.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef jacobsthal_num(n):\n    # Base cases for the first two Jacobsthal numbers\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two Jacobsthal numbers\n    previous = 0  # Jacobsthal(0)\n    current = 1   # Jacobsthal(1)\n    \n    # Iteratively calculate the Jacobsthal numbers up to n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        next_value = previous + 2 * current  # Jacobsthal(n) = Jacobsthal(n-2) + 2 * Jacobsthal(n-1)\n        previous = current  # Move to the next number in the sequence\n        current = next_value  # Update current to the newly calculated value\n    \n    return current  # Return the nth Jacobsthal number\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the Jacobsthal sequence by maintaining the last two computed values and updating them according to the sequence's definition. The loop iterates from 2 to n, calculating each Jacobsthal number based on the previous two values. \n\nNow, I will ensure that the logic correctly follows the sequence definition and returns the expected results.",
