    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to find the nth number in the Jacobsthal sequence, which starts with 0, 1, and continues with each subsequent number being the sum of the number two places before it and the number one place before it. The sequence looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171, 341, 683, 1365, 2731, ...\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the nth Jacobsthal number, we can use a recursive approach where each number is defined as:\n   - Jacobsthal(0) = 0\n   - Jacobsthal(1) = 1\n   - For n >= 2: Jacobsthal(n) = Jacobsthal(n-2) + 2 * Jacobsthal(n-1)\n   We can implement this using a loop to avoid deep recursion and to efficiently compute the value iteratively.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function jacobsthal_num(n):\n       if n == 0:\n           return 0\n       if n == 1:\n           return 1\n       previous = 0\n       current = 1\n       for i from 2 to n:\n           next_value = previous + 2 * current\n           previous = current\n           current = next_value\n       return current\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef jacobsthal_num(n):\n    # Base cases for the first two Jacobsthal numbers\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two Jacobsthal numbers\n    previous = 0  # Jacobsthal(0)\n    current = 1   # Jacobsthal(1)\n    \n    # Iteratively calculate the Jacobsthal numbers up to n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        next_value = previous + 2 * current  # Jacobsthal(n) = Jacobsthal(n-2) + 2 * Jacobsthal(n-1)\n        previous = current  # Move to the next number in the sequence\n        current = next_value  # Update current to the newly calculated value\n    \n    return current  # Return the nth Jacobsthal number\n```",
