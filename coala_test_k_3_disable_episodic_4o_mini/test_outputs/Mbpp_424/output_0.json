    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string in that tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each string in the given tuple, extract the last character of each string, and store these characters in a list. Finally, we will return this list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function extract_rear(input_tuple):\n       create an empty list to hold the last characters\n       for each string in input_tuple:\n           get the last character of the string\n           append the last character to the list\n       return the list of last characters\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef extract_rear(input_tuple):\n    # Create an empty list to hold the last characters\n    last_characters = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each string in the input tuple\n    for string in input_tuple:\n        # Get the last character of the string\n        last_character = string[-1]\n        # Append the last character to the list\n        last_characters.append(last_character)\n    \n    # Return the list of last characters\n    return last_characters\n```",
