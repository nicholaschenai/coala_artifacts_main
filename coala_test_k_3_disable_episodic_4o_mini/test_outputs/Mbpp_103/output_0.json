    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to compute the Eulerian number \\( a(n, m) \\), which represents the number of permutations of \\( n \\) elements in which exactly \\( m \\) elements are greater than the previous element. The function should return the value of \\( a(n, m) \\) for given inputs \\( n \\) and \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the Eulerian number, we can use a recursive relationship. The Eulerian number can be computed using the following recurrence relation:\n   - \\( a(n, m) = (n - m) \\cdot a(n - 1, m - 1) + (m + 1) \\cdot a(n - 1, m) \\)\n   This means that the number of permutations can be derived from the permutations of \\( n-1 \\) elements, either by adding a new element that is greater than the last or one that is less than or equal to the last.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function eulerian_num(n, m):\n       if m == 0:\n           return 1\n       if n == 0:\n           return 0\n       return (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1) + (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef eulerian_num(n, m):\n    # Base case: if m is 0, there's exactly one permutation (the identity)\n    if m == 0:\n        return 1\n    # Base case: if n is 0, there are no permutations\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    # Recursive case: use the recurrence relation to compute the Eulerian number\n    return (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1) + (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m)\n```",
