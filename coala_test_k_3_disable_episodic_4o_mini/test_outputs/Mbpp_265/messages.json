The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved calculating the sum of specific elements from a sorted list of all possible sums of continuous subarrays derived from a given list of positive integers. The key steps included generating all subarray sums, sorting them, and then summing the elements between specified indices.\n\n    The solution effectively utilized nested loops to compute the subarray sums, which were then sorted. The final sum was calculated by iterating over the specified range of indices. The implementation was straightforward and adhered to the constraints provided, ensuring that the result was returned modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n    One important takeaway is the efficiency of generating subarray sums using a cumulative approach, where the current sum is updated as we extend the subarray. This method avoids recalculating sums from scratch, making it more efficient. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def rangeSum(self, nums: list[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n            subarray_sums = []\n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n            subarray_sums.sort()\n            total_sum = 0\n            for index in range(left - 1, right):\n                total_sum += subarray_sums[index]\n            return total_sum % (10**9 + 7)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data structures to achieve the desired results.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In attempting to solve the problem of unflattening a list based on specific rules, I encountered several challenges related to correctly managing the direction of processing and handling sub-arrays. The core concept involved alternating the direction of processing (left to right, then right to left) and determining how many elements to take based on the remainder of the current number divided by the count of remaining elements.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a function that attempted to toggle the direction after processing the entire array. However, this approach led to incorrect handling of indices and sub-arrays, resulting in runtime errors and failure to produce the expected output. The main issues were related to not properly skipping over elements that were included in sub-arrays and incorrectly resetting the index for the next run.\n\n    The key strategies that did not work included:\n    - Incorrectly managing the index after processing sub-arrays, which caused the function to either miss elements or exceed the bounds of the list.\n    - Failing to correctly toggle the direction and set the index for the next run based on the direction of processing.\n\n    To fix these issues, I needed to ensure that the index was adjusted correctly after processing each element or sub-array, and that the direction was toggled appropriately without losing track of the current position in the list. \n\n    The final implementation should focus on:\n    - Correctly calculating the remainder and determining when to create sub-arrays.\n    - Properly managing the index and direction to ensure all elements are processed as required.\n\n    Here is the last attempted code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n        if depth == 0:\n            return flat_array\n    \n        new_array = []\n        direction = 1  # Start with left to right\n        index = 0  # Starting index for left to right\n    \n        while index < len(flat_array):\n            current_number = flat_array[index]\n            remaining_elements = len(flat_array) - index\n            remainder = current_number % remaining_elements\n        \n            if remainder < 3:\n                new_array.append(current_number)\n                index += 1\n            else:\n                sub_array = flat_array[index:index + remainder]\n                new_array.append(unflatten(sub_array, depth - 1))\n                index += remainder\n        \n            # Direction handling logic needs to be revisited for correctness\n    \n        return new_array\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing indices and understanding the flow of recursive functions, especially when dealing with nested structures.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
