    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that checks if there is no profit and no loss when comparing two amounts of money. Specifically, if the first amount is equal to the second amount, the function should return `True`, indicating no profit or loss. If the amounts are different, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if there is no profit and no loss, we simply need to compare the two amounts. If they are equal, we return `True`. If they are not equal, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION noprofit_noloss(amount1, amount2):\n       IF amount1 is equal to amount2 THEN\n           RETURN True\n       ELSE\n           RETURN False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef noprofit_noloss(amount1, amount2):\n    # Check if the two amounts are equal\n    if amount1 == amount2:\n        return True  # No profit, no loss\n    else:\n        return False  # There is profit or loss\n```",
