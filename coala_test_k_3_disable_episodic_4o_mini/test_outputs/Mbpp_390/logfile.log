INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/390 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and a format string. The function should apply the format string to each number in the list, replacing the placeholder in the format string with the number itself. The result should be a new list containing the formatted strings.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will define a function that takes two parameters: a list of numbers and a format string.
   - We will iterate over each number in the list.
   - For each number, we will use the format string to create a new string by replacing the placeholder with the current number.
   - We will collect all the formatted strings in a new list and return that list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function add_string(numbers, format_string):
       create an empty list called result
       for each number in numbers:
           formatted_string = format_string with number inserted
           append formatted_string to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def add_string(numbers, format_string):
    # Create an empty list to hold the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # Format the string by replacing the placeholder with the current number
        formatted_string = format_string.format(number)
        
        # Append the formatted string to the result list
        result.append(formatted_string)
    
    # Return the list of formatted strings
    return result

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to create a function that converts a number to a specified base, including handling both integer and fractional parts. The function needed to support bases from 2 to 36 and format the output correctly as a string.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Base Conversion**: The core concept involved repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders to form the digits in the new base.
    - **Handling Decimals**: For fractional parts, the approach involved multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting the integer part as the next digit.

    ### Issues Encountered:
    1. **Integer Conversion Logic**: The initial implementation failed to correctly convert integers to the specified base, leading to incorrect outputs for several test cases. The remainders were not being calculated or collected properly.
    2. **Fractional Part Handling**: The logic for converting the fractional part was also flawed, resulting in incorrect decimal outputs.
    3. **Output Formatting**: The formatting for zero and decimal places was incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

    ### Strategies That Worked:
    - The use of lists to collect digits and then reversing them for the final output was a good approach, but it needed to be applied correctly.
    - Ensuring that the function could handle negative numbers and zero was crucial for comprehensive functionality.

    ### Code Snippet:
    Hereâ€™s the final version of the function that was intended to address the issues:

    ```python
    def converter(n, decimals=0, base=3.141592653589793):
        if n == 0:
            return "0" + (".0" * decimals if decimals > 0 else "")
    
        if n < 0:
            sign = "-"
            n = -n
        else:
            sign = ""
    
        integer_part = int(n)
        fractional_part = n - integer_part
    
        digits = []
        while integer_part > 0:
            remainder = int(integer_part % base)
            if remainder >= 10:
                digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('A')))
            else:
                digits.append(str(remainder))
            integer_part = int(integer_part // base)
    
        integer_result = ''.join(reversed(digits)) if digits else "0"
    
        if decimals > 0:
            fractional_digits = []
            while decimals > 0:
                fractional_part *= base
                fractional_digit = int(fractional_part)
                if fractional_digit >= 10:
                    fractional_digits.append(chr(fractional_digit - 10 + ord('A')))
                else:
                    fractional_digits.append(str(fractional_digit))
                fractional_part -= fractional_digit
                decimals -= 1
        
            fractional_result = ''.join(fractional_digits)
            return sign + integer_result + "." + fractional_result
    
        return sign + integer_result
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    The experience highlighted the importance of carefully implementing base conversion logic and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts are handled correctly. Future attempts should focus on validating the conversion process with a wider range of test cases to ensure robustness.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

    The official solution provided a more efficient and concise approach to converting a number to a specified base, particularly with the handling of both integer and fractional parts. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

    1. **Use of Mathematical Functions**: The official solution utilizes the `log` function to determine the maximum power of the base that fits into the number. This is a more efficient way to handle the conversion compared to repeatedly dividing the number.

    2. **Handling of Digits**: The solution uses a predefined string `DIGS` to map numeric values to their corresponding characters for bases greater than 10. This simplifies the conversion process and avoids the need for conditional checks during digit conversion.

    3. **Efficient Looping**: The loop iterates over a range that includes both the fractional and integer parts, allowing for a single pass to build the result string. This contrasts with my approach, which separated the integer and fractional conversions into different sections.

    4. **Negative Numbers**: The solution handles negative numbers by prepending a '-' sign based on the condition of `n`, which is a clean and effective way to manage the sign.

    5. **Output Formatting**: The official solution constructs the output string in a single list and joins it at the end, which is generally more efficient than concatenating strings directly.

    ### Key Takeaways
    - Using mathematical properties (like logarithms) can simplify the problem and improve performance.
    - Predefined mappings for digits can streamline the conversion process.
    - Combining the handling of integer and fractional parts into a single loop can reduce complexity and improve readability.
    - Efficient string construction techniques (like using lists) can enhance performance in Python.

    Overall, the official solution is more elegant and efficient than my initial attempts, highlighting the importance of leveraging mathematical insights and efficient data structures in programming challenges.
