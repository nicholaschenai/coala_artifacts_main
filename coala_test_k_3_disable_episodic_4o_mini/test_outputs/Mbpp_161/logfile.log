Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/161 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two lists as input. The first list contains a series of numbers, and the second list contains numbers that we want to remove from the first list. The function should return a new list that contains only the numbers from the first list that are not present in the second list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the first list and check if each element is present in the second list. If an element from the first list is not found in the second list, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function remove_elements(list1, list2):
       create an empty list called result
       for each element in list1:
           if element is not in list2:
               add element to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    # Create an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each element in the first list
    for element in list1:
        # Check if the element is not in the second list
        if element not in list2:
            # If not, add it to the result list
            result.append(element)
    
    # Return the final result list
    return result

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the number of ways to remove a non-empty contiguous subsequence from a given sequence of integers such that the remaining sequence is non-empty and strictly increasing. The solution involved iterating through all possible contiguous subsequences to remove and checking if the remaining sequence met the strictly increasing condition.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate and evaluate subsequences efficiently. The approach involved two nested loops to consider all possible starting and ending indices for the subsequence to be removed. After forming the remaining sequence, a helper function was used to check if it was strictly increasing.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was straightforward. The helper function `is_strictly_increasing` was crucial for validating the remaining sequence. The solution was efficient enough given the constraints, but it could be optimized further for larger inputs by avoiding the creation of new lists for the remaining sequence.

    Here’s the key code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def is_strictly_increasing(sequence):
        for i in range(1, len(sequence)):
            if sequence[i] <= sequence[i - 1]:
                return False
        return True

    def count_ways_to_remove_subsequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
            count = 0
        
            for start in range(N):
                for end in range(start, N):
                    remaining_sequence = A[0:start] + A[end + 1:N]
                    if remaining_sequence and is_strictly_increasing(remaining_sequence):
                        count += 1
        
            print(count)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding subsequences and their properties, as well as the need for efficient checks when dealing with potentially large datasets.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The problem involved finding the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, specifically after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements. The key insight was recognizing that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to the Pisano period. This allowed for efficient computation even for very large values of N (up to 10^18).

    The solution was structured into three main functions: one to compute the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using the Pisano period, another to determine the last remaining number after the removal process, and a final function to handle input and output. The approach of reducing N by half in each iteration of the removal process was effective, as it directly correlated with the position in the last digits array.

    The final implementation passed the provided test cases successfully, demonstrating that the strategy of leveraging the periodicity of Fibonacci last digits was both efficient and effective. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The solution is useful for similar problems involving sequences and periodicity. 

    Key code snippets:
    ```python
    def last_digit_fibonacci(n):
        # Calculate the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using Pisano period
        ...

    def find_last_remaining_number(n):
        # Find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements
        ...

    def solve():
        # Handle input and output
        ...
    ```
