    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its width and height. The area is determined by multiplying these two dimensions together.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the area of a rectangle, we need to take two inputs: the width and the height. The area can be calculated using the formula: Area = Width \u00d7 Height. We will then return the calculated area.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION rectangle_area(width, height):\n       area = width * height\n       RETURN area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the area of a rectangle\ndef rectangle_area(width, height):\n    # Calculate the area by multiplying width and height\n    area = width * height\n    # Return the calculated area\n    return area\n```",
