The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, including only every Kth Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.\n\n    The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. \n\n    The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def fibonacci(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\n    def S(N, K):\n        sum_fib = 0\n        for i in range(0, N + 1):\n            if i % K == 0:\n                sum_fib += fibonacci(i)\n        return sum_fib\n    ``` \n\n    Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution provides a more efficient approach to solving the problem of reducing a positive integer `n` to `1` through a series of operations. While my initial recursive solution was conceptually sound, it could lead to excessive function calls and potential stack overflow for larger values of `n`. The official solution, on the other hand, employs an iterative approach, which is generally more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.\n\n    Key insights from the official solution include:\n\n    1. **Iterative Approach**: Instead of using recursion, the official solution uses a `while` loop to continuously modify `n` until it reaches `1`. This avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and stack management.\n\n    2. **Handling Odd Numbers**: The official solution optimizes the handling of odd numbers by checking specific conditions:\n       - If `n % 4 == 1` or `n == 3`, it decrements `n` by `1`. This is because reducing `n` in these cases leads to a quicker path to an even number, which can then be halved.\n       - For other odd numbers, it increments `n` by `1`, which also leads to an even number.\n\n    3. **Counting Operations**: The solution maintains a counter (`ans`) to track the number of operations performed, which is incremented in each iteration.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is more efficient and avoids the pitfalls of recursion, making it a better choice for larger inputs. This experience highlights the importance of considering both iterative and recursive approaches when solving problems, especially in terms of performance and resource management.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
