    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the first two odd natural numbers are 1 and 3, and their fourth powers are 1^4 and 3^4. The function should return the sum of these values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Identify the first `n` odd natural numbers. The `k`-th odd number can be calculated using the formula `2*k - 1`.\n   - Compute the fourth power of each of these odd numbers.\n   - Sum all the fourth powers together and return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function odd_num_sum(n):\n       total_sum = 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           odd_number = 2 * i - 1  // Calculate the i-th odd number\n           fourth_power = odd_number ** 4  // Calculate the fourth power\n           total_sum += fourth_power  // Add to the total sum\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef odd_num_sum(n):\n    total_sum = 0  # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Loop through the first n odd numbers\n        odd_number = 2 * i - 1  # Calculate the i-th odd number\n        fourth_power = odd_number ** 4  # Calculate the fourth power of the odd number\n        total_sum += fourth_power  # Add the fourth power to the total sum\n    return total_sum  # Return the total sum of fourth powers\n```",
