INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/733 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a sorted list of numbers and a target number. The function should return the index of the first occurrence of the target number in the list. If the target number is not found, the function should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   Since the array is sorted, we can use a linear search to find the first occurrence of the target number. We will iterate through the list, and as soon as we find the target number, we will return its index. If we reach the end of the list without finding the target, we will return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_first_occurrence(array, target):
       for index from 0 to length of array - 1:
           if array[index] is equal to target:
               return index
       return -1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_first_occurrence(array, target):
    # Iterate through the array using an index
    for index in range(len(array)):
        # Check if the current element is equal to the target
        if array[index] == target:
            # Return the index of the first occurrence
            return index
    # If the target is not found, return -1
    return -1

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum at least \( K \). The solution involved using a sliding window technique combined with prefix sums to efficiently track the sums of subarrays.

    The core concept was to maintain a running sum while iterating through the array. By calculating prefix sums, we could quickly determine the sum of any subarray. The strategy involved expanding the right pointer to include more elements and contracting the left pointer to minimize the length of valid subarrays when the sum condition was met.

    The final implementation successfully handled the requirements and passed the provided test cases. The use of prefix sums allowed for efficient sum calculations, and the sliding window approach ensured that we explored all potential subarrays without unnecessary recalculations. This method proved effective for the problem constraints, demonstrating a clear pattern for solving similar problems involving subarray sums. 

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def shortestSubarray(self, A: list[int], K: int) -> int:
            n = len(A)
            min_length = float('inf')  # Initialize minimum length as infinity
            current_sum = 0  # Initialize current sum
            left = 0  # Initialize left pointer
            prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)  # Create a prefix sum array

            # Calculate prefix sums
            for i in range(n):
                prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + A[i]

            # Iterate through the prefix sums
            for right in range(1, n + 1):
                current_sum = prefix_sums[right]  # Current sum is the prefix sum at right
            
                # Check if we can find a valid subarray
                while left < right and current_sum - prefix_sums[left] >= K:
                    min_length = min(min_length, right - left)  # Update minimum length
                    left += 1  # Move left pointer to the right

            # Return the result
            return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding prefix sums and sliding window techniques for efficiently solving subarray problems.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.
