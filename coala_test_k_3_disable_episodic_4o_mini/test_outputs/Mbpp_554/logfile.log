INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/554 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each integer in the input list. For each integer, we will check if it is odd (an integer is odd if it is not divisible by 2). If it is odd, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing only the odd integers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function Split(input_list):
       create an empty list called odd_numbers
       for each number in input_list:
           if number is odd:
               add number to odd_numbers
       return odd_numbers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def Split(input_list):
    # Create an empty list to store odd numbers
    odd_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in input_list:
        # Check if the number is odd
        if number % 2 != 0:
            # If it is odd, add it to the odd_numbers list
            odd_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the list of odd numbers
    return odd_numbers

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays containing exactly `k` odd numbers from a given list of integers. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving subarrays and counts.

    The core concept involved maintaining a count of odd numbers within a window defined by two pointers (left and right). As the right pointer expanded the window, the odd count was updated. If the count exceeded `k`, the left pointer was incremented to reduce the count back to `k`. When the count matched `k`, the number of valid subarrays was calculated by counting the even numbers to the left of the current window.

    The implemented solution was efficient and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the sliding window technique is suitable for this type of problem. The key takeaway is the importance of managing two pointers to dynamically adjust the window size while keeping track of specific conditions (in this case, the count of odd numbers). 

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
            result = 0
            left = 0
            odd_count = 0
        
            for right in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                    odd_count += 1
            
                while odd_count > k:
                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                        odd_count -= 1
                    left += 1
            
                if odd_count == k:
                    temp_left = left
                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:
                        temp_left += 1
                    result += (temp_left - left + 1)
        
            return result
    ``` 

    This approach effectively counts the desired subarrays while maintaining a linear time complexity, making it suitable for larger input sizes.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input \( K \) for multiple test cases. The expected output required alternating lines of numbers, where even-indexed lines counted up from `0` to the line index, and odd-indexed lines counted down from the line index to `0`.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Pattern Recognition**: The output pattern alternates between counting up and counting down based on the line index. This was a crucial aspect that needed to be correctly implemented to match the expected output.
    2. **Logic Implementation**: The initial attempts incorrectly generated lines by not adhering to the specified counting logic. The correct approach involved checking if the line index was even or odd and generating the line accordingly.

    ### Code Snippet:
    The final corrected code that adheres to the requirements is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
        for K in test_cases:
            for i in range(K):
                line = ""
                if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index: count up from 0 to i
                    for j in range(i + 1):
                        line += str(j)
                else:  # Odd index: count down from i to 0
                    for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                        line += str(j)
                print(line)

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]
    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
    ```

    ### Lessons Learned:
    - It is essential to carefully analyze the output requirements and ensure that the logic implemented matches those requirements.
    - Alternating patterns can often lead to confusion; clear separation of logic for different cases (even vs. odd) is necessary to avoid errors.
    - Testing with various inputs can help identify edge cases and ensure the robustness of the solution.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
