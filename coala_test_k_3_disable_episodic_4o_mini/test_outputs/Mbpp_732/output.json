    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every occurrence of spaces, commas, or dots with a colon. \n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: We will iterate through each character in the string. If the character is a space, comma, or dot, we will replace it with a colon. If it is any other character, we will keep it unchanged. Finally, we will return the modified string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `replace_specialchar` that takes a string as input.\n   - Initialize an empty result string.\n   - Loop through each character in the input string:\n     - If the character is a space, comma, or dot, append a colon to the result string.\n     - Otherwise, append the character itself to the result string.\n   - Return the result string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef replace_specialchar(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty result string\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is a space, comma, or dot\n        if char in [' ', ',', '.']:\n            result += ':'  # Replace with a colon\n        else:\n            result += char  # Keep the character unchanged\n    \n    return result  # Return the modified string\n```",
