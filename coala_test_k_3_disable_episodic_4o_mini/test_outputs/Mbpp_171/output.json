    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of one of its sides. A regular pentagon has all sides of equal length, so the perimeter can be found by multiplying the length of one side by five.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the perimeter of a regular pentagon, we simply need to take the length of one side and multiply it by 5. This is because a pentagon has five equal sides. The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a regular pentagon with side length \\( s \\) is:\n   \\[\n   P = 5 \\times s\n   \\]\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n       RETURN 5 * side_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n    # Calculate the perimeter of a regular pentagon\n    # The perimeter is 5 times the length of one side\n    return 5 * side_length\n```",
