2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/600 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given number is even. If the number is even, the function should return `True`, and if it is odd, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if a number is even, we can use the modulus operator `%`. If a number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0, then it is even. Otherwise, it is odd. We will implement a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value based on this check.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function is_Even(number):
       If number % 2 == 0:
           Return True
       Else:
           Return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to check if a number is even
def is_Even(number):
    # Check if the number is divisible by 2
    if number % 2 == 0:
        # If true, return True (the number is even)
        return True
    else:
        # If false, return False (the number is odd)
        return False

[Summary]:
    The problem involves reducing a positive integer `n` to `1` using a minimum number of operations, where the operations depend on whether `n` is even or odd. The core concepts tested here include recursion and decision-making based on the parity of the number. 

    The solution was implemented using a recursive approach, where the function checks if `n` is even or odd. If even, it divides `n` by `2` and counts that as one operation. If odd, it explores both options (adding or subtracting `1`) and takes the minimum of the two results. This approach effectively captures the necessary operations to reach `1`.

    The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the recursive strategy is effective for this problem. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution was efficient for the given constraints. The recursive nature of the solution allows for clear logic flow, although it could be optimized further using memoization to avoid redundant calculations in larger inputs. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
            if n == 1:
                return 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                return 1 + self.integerReplacement(n // 2)
            else:
                return 1 + min(self.integerReplacement(n + 1), self.integerReplacement(n - 1))
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of p allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers A and B. The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.

    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.

    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. 

    Key code snippet for counting divisors:
    ```python
    def count_divisors(n):
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
        return count
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.

    The official solution provides a more efficient approach to solving the problem of reducing a positive integer `n` to `1` through a series of operations. While my initial recursive solution was conceptually sound, it could lead to excessive function calls and potential stack overflow for larger values of `n`. The official solution, on the other hand, employs an iterative approach, which is generally more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.

    Key insights from the official solution include:

    1. **Iterative Approach**: Instead of using recursion, the official solution uses a `while` loop to continuously modify `n` until it reaches `1`. This avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and stack management.

    2. **Handling Odd Numbers**: The official solution optimizes the handling of odd numbers by checking specific conditions:
       - If `n % 4 == 1` or `n == 3`, it decrements `n` by `1`. This is because reducing `n` in these cases leads to a quicker path to an even number, which can then be halved.
       - For other odd numbers, it increments `n` by `1`, which also leads to an even number.

    3. **Counting Operations**: The solution maintains a counter (`ans`) to track the number of operations performed, which is incremented in each iteration.

    Overall, the official solution is more efficient and avoids the pitfalls of recursion, making it a better choice for larger inputs. This experience highlights the importance of considering both iterative and recursive approaches when solving problems, especially in terms of performance and resource management.
