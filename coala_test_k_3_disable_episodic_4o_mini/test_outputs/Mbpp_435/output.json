    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a number as input and returns the last digit of that number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the last digit of a number, we can use the modulus operator. Specifically, we can take the number and perform a modulus operation with 10. This will give us the remainder when the number is divided by 10, which is effectively the last digit of the number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION last_Digit(number):\n       RETURN number MOD 10\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef last_Digit(number):\n    # Use the modulus operator to find the last digit\n    return number % 10  # The last digit is the remainder when divided by 10\n```",
