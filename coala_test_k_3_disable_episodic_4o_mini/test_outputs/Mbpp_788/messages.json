The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.\n\n    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of \"abacaba\". The logic needed to ensure that after placing \"abacaba\", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. Checking how many times \"abacaba\" already appeared in the string.\n    2. Attempting to place \"abacaba\" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.\n    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.\n    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.\n\n    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            n = case[0]\n            s = case[1]\n            modified_string = list(s)\n\n            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            placed = False\n            for i in range(n - 6):\n                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):\n                    temp_string = modified_string[:]\n                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)\n                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:\n                        modified_string = temp_string\n                        placed = True\n                        break\n\n            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            if final_count != 1:\n                print(\"No\")\n            else:\n                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)\n                print(\"Yes\")\n                print(\"\".join(modified_string))\n\n    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != \"abacaba\"[j]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            s[index + j] = \"abacaba\"[j]\n\n    def count_abacaba(s):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n            if \"\".join(s[i:i + 7]) == \"abacaba\":\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\n    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i] == '?':\n                s[i] = 'z'\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(input())\n        s = input().strip()\n        test_cases.append((n, s))\n\n    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\n    In tackling the problem of accumulating scores for programming competition teams with scrambled names, my initial approach involved normalizing team names by sorting their characters and using a dictionary to store scores. While this method was fundamentally sound, it had a few shortcomings that I learned from.\n\n    The official solution effectively uses a similar normalization strategy but optimizes the process by maintaining a list of tuples that directly associates the original team names with their scores. This allows for efficient updates and retrievals without losing the original names. The key steps in the official solution include:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and the number of submissions efficiently.\n    2. **Score Accumulation**: It uses a list to store scores and normalized names, allowing for direct access and updates when processing submissions.\n    3. **Sorting and Output**: After accumulating scores, it sorts the list based on scores and outputs the results in the required format.\n\n    One of the main insights from the official solution is the use of a list to store both the score and the original team name, which simplifies the process of updating scores and ensures that the original names are preserved for output. This contrasts with my initial implementation, where I lost track of the original names by using normalized names as dictionary keys.\n\n    Additionally, the official solution's approach to sorting and outputting results is straightforward and efficient, ensuring that the final output meets the problem's requirements without unnecessary complexity.\n\n    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of maintaining data integrity (in this case, preserving original names) while processing and accumulating results, as well as the value of efficient data structures for managing updates and retrievals.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\n    In my attempts to solve the problem of finding the shortest superstring, I learned several key insights that highlight the differences between my approach and the official solution.\n\n    1. **Handling Overlaps**: My initial implementation focused on merging strings based on maximum overlaps but did not effectively explore all possible combinations of string arrangements. The official solution uses a more systematic approach by defining a `merge` function that checks for overlaps in a more comprehensive manner, ensuring that the best possible merge is achieved.\n\n    2. **Memoization**: The official solution employs memoization to optimize the recursive function that finds the shortest superstring. This technique significantly reduces redundant calculations by storing previously computed results, which I did not implement in my solution. This is crucial for improving performance, especially given the potential exponential number of combinations.\n\n    3. **Tuple Representation**: The official solution uses tuples to represent the indices of the strings being processed, which simplifies the management of remaining strings during recursion. This contrasts with my approach, which directly manipulated lists, leading to more complex logic and potential inefficiencies.\n\n    4. **Final Selection**: The official solution efficiently finds the minimum length superstring by evaluating all possible starting points and using the `min` function to select the shortest result. My approach did not adequately ensure that all permutations were considered in a way that guaranteed the shortest output.\n\n    ### Key Code Snippets from the Official Solution\n    - **Merge Function**:\n        ```python\n        def merge(w1, w2):\n            for k in range(len(w2), -1, -1):\n                if w1.endswith(w2[:k]):\n                    return w1 + w2[k:]\n        ```\n\n    - **Memoization Decorator**:\n        ```python\n        def memo(f):\n            dic = {}\n            def f_alt(*args):\n                if args not in dic:\n                    dic[args] = f(*args)\n                return dic[args]\n            return f_alt\n        ```\n\n    - **Recursive Function**:\n        ```python\n        @memo\n        def find_short(tup, last):\n            if len(tup) == 1:\n                return A[tup[0]]\n            mtup = tuple(t for t in tup if t != last)\n            return min((merge(find_short(mtup, t), A[last]) for t in mtup), key=len)\n        ```\n\n    Overall, the official solution's use of memoization, efficient merging, and tuple management provides a more effective and optimized approach to solving the problem, highlighting areas for improvement in my own coding strategies.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
