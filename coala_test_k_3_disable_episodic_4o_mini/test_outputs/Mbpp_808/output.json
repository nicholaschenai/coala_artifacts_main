    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that checks if a specific number (k) is present in a given tuple of numbers. The function should return `True` if the number is found in the tuple and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach where we check if the number k exists in the tuple. We can do this by iterating through the elements of the tuple and comparing each element with k. If we find a match, we return `True`. If we finish checking all elements without finding a match, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_K(tup, k):\n       for each element in tup:\n           if element is equal to k:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_K(tup, k):\n    # Iterate through each element in the tuple\n    for element in tup:\n        # Check if the current element is equal to k\n        if element == k:\n            return True  # Return True if k is found\n    return False  # Return False if k is not found in the tuple\n```",
