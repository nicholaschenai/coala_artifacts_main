The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.\n\n    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            if K == N:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In my attempts to solve the permutation problem, I learned several key insights about the approach and logic required to derive a valid permutation that meets the specified conditions. \n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\). This understanding is crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a specific \\( K \\).\n\n    2. **Feasibility Conditions**: The official solution checks specific conditions to determine if \\( K \\) is achievable:\n       - For even \\( N \\), \\( K \\) must be within the bounds of \\( (N(N+1)/2 - 1) \\) and \\( 3((N/2)^2) - 1 \\).\n       - For odd \\( N \\), similar bounds apply, but with adjustments for the odd case.\n\n    3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution constructs the permutation by:\n       - Starting with a descending order.\n       - Adjusting elements based on the difference between the desired \\( K \\) and the maximum possible sum.\n       - Using a systematic approach to fill in the permutation while ensuring that the conditions for \\( K \\) are met.\n\n    4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution employs an iterative method to adjust the permutation based on the remaining value of \\( K \\) after accounting for the maximum possible sum. This involves incrementally modifying the permutation to reach the desired sum.\n\n    ### Code Snippet from Official Solution:\n    The official solution uses a structured approach to handle both even and odd cases, ensuring that the permutation is constructed correctly based on the conditions derived from \\( K \\).\n\n    ```python\n    if(n%2==0):\n        if(k<(n*(n+1))//2 - 1  or  k>3*((n//2)**2) - 1): print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    else:\n        if(n==1): print(1) if(k==0) else print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    The official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. My previous attempts failed primarily due to not fully accounting for the bounds of \\( K \\) and the systematic construction of the permutation. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and the need for a structured approach to constructing solutions in combinatorial problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
