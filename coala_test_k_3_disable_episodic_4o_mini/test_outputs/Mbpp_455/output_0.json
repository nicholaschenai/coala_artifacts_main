    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that checks if a given month number (from 1 to 12) has 31 days. The function should return `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We need to identify which months have 31 days. The months that have 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). We can create a list of these month numbers and check if the input month number is in that list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `check_monthnumb_number(month: int) -> bool`.\n   - Create a list of month numbers that have 31 days: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`.\n   - Check if the input month is in this list.\n   - Return `True` if it is, otherwise return `False`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_monthnumb_number(month: int) -> bool:\n    # List of months that have 31 days\n    months_with_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]\n    # Check if the given month is in the list\n    return month in months_with_31_days\n\n```",
