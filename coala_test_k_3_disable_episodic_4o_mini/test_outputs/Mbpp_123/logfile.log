INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/123 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 up to a given number (in this case, 999). Amicable numbers are two different numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Define a function to find the sum of proper divisors of a number.
   - Iterate through all numbers from 1 to the specified limit.
   - For each number, check if it forms an amicable pair with another number.
   - If it does, add both numbers to a set to avoid duplicates.
   - Finally, return the sum of all unique amicable numbers found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_of_proper_divisors(n):
       sum = 0
       for i from 1 to n/2:
           if n is divisible by i:
               sum += i
       return sum

   function amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
       amicable_numbers = set()
       for num from 1 to limit:
           partner = sum_of_proper_divisors(num)
           if partner != num and sum_of_proper_divisors(partner) == num:
               amicable_numbers.add(num)
               amicable_numbers.add(partner)
       return sum(amicable_numbers)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sum_of_proper_divisors(n):
    # This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of n
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            total += i
    return total

def amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
    # This function finds all amicable numbers up to the specified limit and returns their sum
    amicable_numbers = set()  # Use a set to avoid duplicates
    for num in range(1, limit + 1):
        partner = sum_of_proper_divisors(num)  # Find the sum of proper divisors
        # Check if the partner is different and forms an amicable pair
        if partner != num and sum_of_proper_divisors(partner) == num:
            amicable_numbers.add(num)  # Add the first number
            amicable_numbers.add(partner)  # Add the partner number
    return sum(amicable_numbers)  # Return the sum of all unique amicable numbers

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, including only every Kth Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.

    The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. 

    The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. 

    Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. 

    Here’s the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

    def S(N, K):
        sum_fib = 0
        for i in range(0, N + 1):
            if i % K == 0:
                sum_fib += fibonacci(i)
        return sum_fib
    ``` 

    Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The problem involved calculating the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The solution required understanding arithmetic series and efficiently calculating the sum without iterating through all multiples, which is crucial given the constraints (N can be as large as 1 billion).

    The approach used was to determine the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, then calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10 up to that point. The sum was computed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. This method is efficient and avoids potential performance issues with large inputs.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway is the importance of leveraging mathematical formulas for series to optimize calculations, especially when dealing with large ranges. 

    Here’s the core function used:

    ```python
    def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
        largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
        number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10
        sum_multiples = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2
        return sum_multiples
    ```

    This function efficiently computes the desired sum, demonstrating the effectiveness of using arithmetic properties in programming challenges.
