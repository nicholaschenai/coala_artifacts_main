    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes an IP address as a string and removes any leading zeroes from each of the four octets (the numbers separated by dots) in the IP address.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can split the IP address string into its four components using the dot as a delimiter. Then, for each component, we will convert it to an integer to automatically remove any leading zeroes. Finally, we will join these components back together with dots to form the cleaned-up IP address.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `removezero_ip(ip: str) -> str`.\n   - Split the input string `ip` by the dot character to get a list of octets.\n   - For each octet in the list:\n     - Convert the octet to an integer to remove leading zeroes.\n     - Convert it back to a string.\n   - Join the list of cleaned octets back into a single string with dots.\n   - Return the resulting string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip: str) -> str:\n    # Split the IP address into its four octets\n    octets = ip.split('.')\n    \n    # Remove leading zeroes by converting each octet to an integer and back to string\n    cleaned_octets = [str(int(octet)) for octet in octets]\n    \n    # Join the cleaned octets back into a single string with dots\n    return '.'.join(cleaned_octets)\n```",
