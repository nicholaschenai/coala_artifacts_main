    "raw_msg": "Given the previous analysis and the need to ensure the surface area calculation for the square pyramid is correct, let's revisit the code. The goal is to ensure that the calculations yield the expected output of 33 for the input `surface_Area(3, 4)`.\n\n### Key Points to Address:\n1. **Base Area Calculation**: This part is correct as it is simply the square of the base edge.\n2. **Slant Height Calculation**: This is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and should be accurate.\n3. **Lateral Area Calculation**: The lateral area should be calculated as the total area of the four triangular faces, which is \\( 2 \\times \\text{base\\_edge} \\times \\text{slant\\_height} \\).\n4. **Final Surface Area Calculation**: The total surface area should be the sum of the base area and the lateral area.\n\n### Revised Code:\nAfter reviewing the calculations, I will ensure that the values are computed correctly and that the final output matches the expected result. Here\u2019s the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef surface_Area(base_edge: float, height: float) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of the base (square)\n    base_area = base_edge * base_edge\n    \n    # Calculate the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem\n    slant_height = ((base_edge / 2) ** 2 + height ** 2) ** 0.5\n    \n    # Calculate the lateral area (4 triangular faces)\n    lateral_area = 2 * base_edge * slant_height  # This is for two triangles, so we need to multiply by 2\n    \n    # Total surface area is the sum of base area and lateral area\n    total_surface_area = base_area + lateral_area\n    \n    # Return the total surface area as an integer\n    return int(total_surface_area)  # Ensure we are rounding down to the nearest integer\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Base Area**: Calculated as \\( \\text{base\\_edge}^2 \\).\n- **Slant Height**: Calculated using the formula derived from the Pythagorean theorem.\n- **Lateral Area**: Correctly calculated as \\( 2 \\times \\text{base\\_edge} \\times \\text{slant\\_height} \\).\n- **Total Surface Area**: The sum of the base area and lateral area, returned as an integer.\n\nThis code should now yield the correct output for the given test case.",
