    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the surface area of a square pyramid given the length of one side of its square base and its height. The function should return the surface area as an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The surface area of a square pyramid can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Surface Area} = \\text{Base Area} + \\text{Lateral Area}\n   \\]\n   The base area of the pyramid is simply the area of the square base, which is the side length squared. The lateral area consists of the area of the four triangular faces. Each triangular face has a base equal to the side length and a height that can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. The height of each triangle can be found by calculating the slant height of the pyramid.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function surface_Area(base_edge: float, height: float) -> int:\n       base_area = base_edge * base_edge\n       slant_height = sqrt((base_edge / 2) ** 2 + height ** 2)\n       lateral_area = 2 * base_edge * slant_height\n       total_surface_area = base_area + lateral_area\n       return int(total_surface_area)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef surface_Area(base_edge: float, height: float) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of the base (square)\n    base_area = base_edge * base_edge\n    \n    # Calculate the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem\n    slant_height = ((base_edge / 2) ** 2 + height ** 2) ** 0.5\n    \n    # Calculate the lateral area (4 triangular faces)\n    lateral_area = 2 * base_edge * slant_height\n    \n    # Total surface area is the sum of base area and lateral area\n    total_surface_area = base_area + lateral_area\n    \n    # Return the total surface area as an integer\n    return int(total_surface_area)\n```",
