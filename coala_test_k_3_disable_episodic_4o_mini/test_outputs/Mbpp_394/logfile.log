1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/394 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given tuple contains any duplicate elements. If there are duplicates, the function should return `False`; if all elements are unique, it should return `True`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if a tuple has duplicates, we can use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. As we iterate through the tuple, we will check if each element is already in the set. If it is, we have found a duplicate and can return `False`. If we finish checking all elements without finding duplicates, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_distinct(tup):
       create an empty set called seen
       for each element in tup:
           if element is in seen:
               return False
           add element to seen
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def check_distinct(tup):
    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen elements
    seen = set()
    
    # Iterate through each element in the tuple
    for element in tup:
        # If the element is already in the seen set, return False
        if element in seen:
            return False
        # Add the element to the seen set
        seen.add(element)
    
    # If no duplicates were found, return True
    return True

    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

    In tackling the problem of determining if three adjacent sides of a cube are painted the same color, my initial approach was logically sound and correctly identified the necessary combinations of sides to check. However, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient implementation.

    **Key Insights from the Official Solution:**
    1. **Use of Indexing**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides directly. This approach simplifies the checking process by avoiding multiple conditional statements and instead iterating through predefined combinations.
  
    2. **Set for Uniqueness**: The official solution leverages the `set` data structure to check if all three colors are the same. By converting the list of colors to a set, it effectively checks for uniqueness in a single line, which is both elegant and efficient.

    3. **Control Flow**: The use of a counter (`c`) to track whether a match was found is straightforward, but the official solution could be further simplified by directly printing "YES" or "NO" based on the condition without needing an additional variable.

    **Comparison with My Approach**:
    - My solution explicitly checked each combination with multiple `or` conditions, which, while clear, could be seen as verbose compared to the official solution's use of a loop over a predefined list of combinations.
    - The official solution's use of `set` for checking color equality is a more Pythonic approach, reducing the complexity of the condition checks.

    ### Conclusion
    The official solution is more efficient in terms of readability and maintainability. It highlights the importance of leveraging built-in data structures and concise control flow in Python. In future problems, I will aim to adopt similar strategies to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.

    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the number of ways to remove a non-empty contiguous subsequence from a given sequence of integers such that the remaining sequence is non-empty and strictly increasing. The solution involved iterating through all possible contiguous subsequences to remove and checking if the remaining sequence met the strictly increasing condition.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate and evaluate subsequences efficiently. The approach involved two nested loops to consider all possible starting and ending indices for the subsequence to be removed. After forming the remaining sequence, a helper function was used to check if it was strictly increasing.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was straightforward. The helper function `is_strictly_increasing` was crucial for validating the remaining sequence. The solution was efficient enough given the constraints, but it could be optimized further for larger inputs by avoiding the creation of new lists for the remaining sequence.

    Here’s the key code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def is_strictly_increasing(sequence):
        for i in range(1, len(sequence)):
            if sequence[i] <= sequence[i - 1]:
                return False
        return True

    def count_ways_to_remove_subsequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
            count = 0
        
            for start in range(N):
                for end in range(start, N):
                    remaining_sequence = A[0:start] + A[end + 1:N]
                    if remaining_sequence and is_strictly_increasing(remaining_sequence):
                        count += 1
        
            print(count)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding subsequences and their properties, as well as the need for efficient checks when dealing with potentially large datasets.
