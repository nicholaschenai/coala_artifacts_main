For example, if the input is \"python programming\", the output should be a list containing the words ['python', 'programming'].\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in string method `split()`, which splits a string into a list where each word is a separate element. By default, `split()` will use any whitespace as the delimiter, which is exactly what we need for this task.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `string_to_list` that takes a single string parameter.\n   - Use the `split()` method on the input string to divide it into a list of words.\n   - Return the resulting list.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function named string_to_list that takes a string as input\ndef string_to_list(input_string: str) -> list:\n    # Use the split method to divide the string into a list of words\n    words_list = input_string.split()\n    # Return the list of words\n    return words_list\n```"

Initially, I incorrectly checked for the substring \"not\" in the quotes, which led to misclassifications when \"not\" appeared as part of other words (e.g., \"nothing\"). \n\n    The key concept was to ensure that \"not\" was treated as a standalone word. The solution required splitting each quote into individual words and checking for the presence of \"not\" in that list. This approach effectively resolved the issue.\n\n    The final working code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def classify_quotes():\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n    \n        # Process each quote\n        for _ in range(T):\n            # Read the quote\n            S = input()\n        \n            # Split the quote into words\n            words = S.split()\n        \n            # Check if the word \"not\" is in the list of words\n            if \"not\" in words:\n                print(\"Real Fancy\")  # Classify as Real Fancy\n            else:\n                print(\"regularly fancy\")  # Classify as regularly fancy\n\n    # Call the function to execute the solution\n    classify_quotes()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and ensuring that checks for specific words are done correctly, especially in string manipulation tasks.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In this experience, I learned the importance of checking for standalone words rather than just substrings when classifying text. My initial solution incorrectly identified quotes containing \"not\" as part of other words (like \"nothing\") as \"Real Fancy\". The official solution effectively addresses this by splitting the input string into a list of words and checking for the presence of \"not\" in that list.\n\n    The official solution uses the `split()` method to break the quote into words, which is similar to my approach. However, it also utilizes a while loop to manage the number of test cases, which is a straightforward way to handle multiple inputs. This method ensures that each quote is processed correctly and efficiently.\n\n    Key insights from the official solution:\n    - Always ensure that checks for specific words account for word boundaries to avoid false positives.\n    - Using a list to store words from the input string allows for easy membership testing with the `in` operator.\n    - Managing multiple test cases can be done effectively with a loop that decrements a counter.\n\n    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of careful string manipulation and the need to consider edge cases in text processing tasks.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring \"abc\" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of \"abc\" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of \"abc\". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
