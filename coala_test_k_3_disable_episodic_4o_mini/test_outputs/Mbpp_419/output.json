    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, and then calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers. Finally, this sum should be multiplied by the number of elements in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - First, we need to iterate through each number in the list.\n   - For each number, we will round it to the nearest integer using Python's built-in `round()` function.\n   - We will keep a running total of these rounded numbers.\n   - After processing all numbers, we will multiply the total sum by the length of the list.\n   - Finally, we will return this final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function round_and_sum(numbers):\n       total_sum = 0\n       for each number in numbers:\n           rounded_number = round(number)\n           total_sum += rounded_number\n       result = total_sum * length of numbers\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef round_and_sum(numbers):\n    total_sum = 0  # Initialize total sum to 0\n    for number in numbers:  # Iterate through each number in the list\n        rounded_number = round(number)  # Round the number to the nearest integer\n        total_sum += rounded_number  # Add the rounded number to the total sum\n    result = total_sum * len(numbers)  # Multiply the total sum by the length of the list\n    return result  # Return the final result\n```",
