    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find common tuples from two lists of tuples, where the order of elements in the tuples does not matter. The output should be a set of these common tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through both lists of tuples and check for common elements. Since the order of elements in the tuples does not matter, we can sort each tuple before checking for intersections. We will use a set to store the common tuples to ensure uniqueness.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `tuple_intersection` that takes two lists of tuples as input.\n   - Create an empty set to store the intersection results.\n   - For each tuple in the first list:\n     - Sort the tuple to normalize its order.\n     - Check if the sorted tuple exists in the second list (after sorting the tuples in the second list).\n     - If it exists, add the original tuple (from the first list) to the intersection set.\n   - Return the intersection set.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef tuple_intersection(list1, list2):\n    # Create a set to store the intersection results\n    intersection = set()\n    \n    # Normalize the second list by sorting each tuple\n    normalized_list2 = {tuple(sorted(tup)) for tup in list2}\n    \n    # Iterate through the first list\n    for tup in list1:\n        # Sort the current tuple to normalize its order\n        sorted_tup = tuple(sorted(tup))\n        # Check if the sorted tuple exists in the normalized second list\n        if sorted_tup in normalized_list2:\n            # If it exists, add the original tuple to the intersection set\n            intersection.add(tup)\n    \n    # Return the set of intersecting tuples\n    return intersection\n\n# The function is declared last as per the instructions\n```",
