    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that identifies the first character in a given string that appears more than once. If a character is repeated, we should return that character; if no characters are repeated, we should return None.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a set to keep track of characters we have already seen as we iterate through the string. For each character, we check if it is already in the set. If it is, we return that character as it is the first repeated one. If we finish checking all characters without finding a repeat, we return None.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function first_repeated_char(string):\n       create an empty set called seen\n       for each character in string:\n           if character is in seen:\n               return character\n           add character to seen\n       return None\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(string: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen characters\n    seen = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for char in string:\n        # If the character is already in the seen set, return it\n        if char in seen:\n            return char\n        # Add the character to the seen set\n        seen.add(char)\n    \n    # If no character is repeated, return None\n    return None\n```",
