Initially, I incorrectly checked for the substring \"not\" in the quotes, which led to misclassifications when \"not\" appeared as part of other words (e.g., \"nothing\"). \n\n    The key concept was to ensure that \"not\" was treated as a standalone word. The solution required splitting each quote into individual words and checking for the presence of \"not\" in that list. This approach effectively resolved the issue.\n\n    The final working code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def classify_quotes():\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n    \n        # Process each quote\n        for _ in range(T):\n            # Read the quote\n            S = input()\n        \n            # Split the quote into words\n            words = S.split()\n        \n            # Check if the word \"not\" is in the list of words\n            if \"not\" in words:\n                print(\"Real Fancy\")  # Classify as Real Fancy\n            else:\n                print(\"regularly fancy\")  # Classify as regularly fancy\n\n    # Call the function to execute the solution\n    classify_quotes()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and ensuring that checks for specific words are done correctly, especially in string manipulation tasks.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring \"abc\" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of \"abc\" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of \"abc\". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. \n\n    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach of generating all possible strings by removing and reinserting characters was effective, and the use of comparisons to track the smallest string worked as intended.\n\n    The final implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each string, and outputting the results. The code was structured to first define the main function and then handle input/output, ensuring clarity and separation of logic. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    for i in range(N):  # Iterate through each character\n        char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to move\n        remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remove the character\n        for j in range(N):  # Try to insert the character at every position\n            new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]\n            if new_string < smallest_string:  # Check if the new string is smaller\n                smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of string manipulation techniques and careful iteration when solving combinatorial problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
