    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and splits it into a list of its individual characters.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach where we iterate through each character in the string and collect them into a list. This can be done using a loop or by utilizing Python's built-in capabilities to convert the string into a list of characters.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Function split(string):\n       Initialize an empty list to hold characters\n       For each character in the string:\n           Append the character to the list\n       Return the list of characters\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef split(string: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to hold characters\n    characters = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for char in string:\n        # Append the character to the list\n        characters.append(char)\n    \n    # Return the list of characters\n    return characters\n```",
