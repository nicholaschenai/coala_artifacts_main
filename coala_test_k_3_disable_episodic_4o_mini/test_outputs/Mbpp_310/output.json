The goal is to match the expected output exactly.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef string_to_tuple(s: str) -> tuple:\n    # Initialize an empty list to hold characters\n    char_list = []\n    \n    # Loop through each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # Append each character to the list\n        char_list.append(char)\n    \n    # Convert the list to a tuple\n    result_tuple = tuple(char_list)\n    \n    # Return the tuple\n    return result_tuple\n``` \n\nThis implementation will now include all characters from the input string, including spaces, and will produce the expected output for the test case provided.",
