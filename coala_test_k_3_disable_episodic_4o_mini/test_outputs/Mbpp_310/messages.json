The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.\n\n    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of \"abacaba\". The logic needed to ensure that after placing \"abacaba\", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. Checking how many times \"abacaba\" already appeared in the string.\n    2. Attempting to place \"abacaba\" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.\n    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.\n    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.\n\n    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            n = case[0]\n            s = case[1]\n            modified_string = list(s)\n\n            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            placed = False\n            for i in range(n - 6):\n                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):\n                    temp_string = modified_string[:]\n                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)\n                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:\n                        modified_string = temp_string\n                        placed = True\n                        break\n\n            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            if final_count != 1:\n                print(\"No\")\n            else:\n                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)\n                print(\"Yes\")\n                print(\"\".join(modified_string))\n\n    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != \"abacaba\"[j]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            s[index + j] = \"abacaba\"[j]\n\n    def count_abacaba(s):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n            if \"\".join(s[i:i + 7]) == \"abacaba\":\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\n    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i] == '?':\n                s[i] = 'z'\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(input())\n        s = input().strip()\n        test_cases.append((n, s))\n\n    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved decoding a string formatted with patterns like `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string`. The solution required parsing the string while managing nested structures, which is a common pattern in problems involving brackets.\n\n    The approach utilized a stack to keep track of the current string and the repeat count. As we iterated through the string, we built numbers for repeat counts, pushed the current state onto the stack when encountering `[`, and popped from the stack to construct the final string when encountering `]`. This method effectively handled nested encodings.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. Key concepts included managing state with a stack and handling string concatenation efficiently. The solution demonstrated the importance of careful parsing and state management in problems involving nested structures. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n            stack = []\n            current_string = \"\"\n            number = 0\n        \n            for char in s:\n                if char.isdigit():\n                    number = number * 10 + int(char)\n                elif char == '[':\n                    stack.append((current_string, number))\n                    current_string = \"\"\n                    number = 0\n                elif char == ']':\n                    last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                    current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n                else:\n                    current_string += char\n        \n            return current_string\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the utility of stacks in managing nested structures and the importance of careful iteration and state management in string manipulation tasks.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the minimum window substring in a string `S` that contains all characters from another string `T`. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is efficient for this type of problem. The key concepts involved were maintaining character counts and dynamically adjusting the window size using two pointers.\n\n    The implementation involved creating two dictionaries: one for counting characters in `T` and another for the current window in `S`. The algorithm expanded the right pointer to include characters until all required characters were present, then contracted the left pointer to minimize the window size while still containing all characters from `T`. This approach ensured that the solution operated in O(n) time complexity.\n\n    The final code snippet effectively captured this logic:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n            # Character counting and sliding window logic\n            ...\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the sliding window technique proved to be a robust strategy for solving the problem, and the implementation was successful without any unexpected errors.

The solution demonstrated the importance of careful parsing and state management in problems involving nested structures. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n            stack = []\n            current_string = \"\"\n            number = 0\n        \n            for char in s:\n                if char.isdigit():\n                    number = number * 10 + int(char)\n                elif char == '[':\n                    stack.append((current_string, number))\n                    current_string = \"\"\n                    number = 0\n                elif char == ']':\n                    last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                    current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n                else:\n                    current_string += char\n        \n            return current_string\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the utility of stacks in managing nested structures and the importance of careful iteration and state management in string manipulation tasks.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to classify quotes based on the presence of the word \"not\". Initially, I incorrectly checked for the substring \"not\" in the quotes, which led to misclassifications when \"not\" appeared as part of other words (e.g., \"nothing\"). \n\n    The key concept was to ensure that \"not\" was treated as a standalone word. The solution required splitting each quote into individual words and checking for the presence of \"not\" in that list. This approach effectively resolved the issue.\n\n    The final working code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def classify_quotes():\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n    \n        # Process each quote\n        for _ in range(T):\n            # Read the quote\n            S = input()\n        \n            # Split the quote into words\n            words = S.split()\n        \n            # Check if the word \"not\" is in the list of words\n            if \"not\" in words:\n                print(\"Real Fancy\")  # Classify as Real Fancy\n            else:\n                print(\"regularly fancy\")  # Classify as regularly fancy\n\n    # Call the function to execute the solution\n    classify_quotes()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and ensuring that checks for specific words are done correctly, especially in string manipulation tasks.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is efficient for this type of problem. The key concepts involved were maintaining character counts and dynamically adjusting the window size using two pointers.\n\n    The implementation involved creating two dictionaries: one for counting characters in `T` and another for the current window in `S`. The algorithm expanded the right pointer to include characters until all required characters were present, then contracted the left pointer to minimize the window size while still containing all characters from `T`. This approach ensured that the solution operated in O(n) time complexity.\n\n    The final code snippet effectively captured this logic:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n            # Character counting and sliding window logic\n            ...\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the sliding window technique proved to be a robust strategy for solving the problem, and the implementation was successful without any unexpected errors. The solution was efficient and met the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring \"abacaba\" appears exactly once. The key concepts involved string manipulation, substring searching, and careful handling of character replacements.\n\n    Initially, the approach involved checking for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" and attempting to place it in the string. However, the first implementation failed to correctly count occurrences after modifications and did not adequately prevent multiple placements of \"abacaba\". The logic needed to ensure that after placing \"abacaba\", the final count of occurrences was exactly one.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. Checking how many times \"abacaba\" already appeared in the string.\n    2. Attempting to place \"abacaba\" in valid positions while ensuring that it would not create additional occurrences.\n    3. Counting occurrences after modifications to confirm that only one instance remained.\n    4. Replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not interfere with the substring.\n\n    The final code effectively handled all test cases by implementing these strategies, ensuring that the output was correct for both valid and invalid scenarios. The solution demonstrated the importance of thorough checks and careful string manipulation in solving substring-related problems. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            n = case[0]\n            s = case[1]\n            modified_string = list(s)\n\n            initial_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            placed = False\n            for i in range(n - 6):\n                if can_place_abacaba(modified_string, i):\n                    temp_string = modified_string[:]\n                    place_abacaba(temp_string, i)\n                    if count_abacaba(temp_string) == 1:\n                        modified_string = temp_string\n                        placed = True\n                        break\n\n            final_count = count_abacaba(modified_string)\n\n            if final_count != 1:\n                print(\"No\")\n            else:\n                replace_remaining_question_marks(modified_string)\n                print(\"Yes\")\n                print(\"\".join(modified_string))\n\n    def can_place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if s[index + j] != '?' and s[index + j] != \"abacaba\"[j]:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def place_abacaba(s, index):\n        for j in range(7):\n            s[index + j] = \"abacaba\"[j]\n\n    def count_abacaba(s):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(s) - 6):\n            if \"\".join(s[i:i + 7]) == \"abacaba\":\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\n    def replace_remaining_question_marks(s):\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            if s[i] == '?':\n                s[i] = 'z'\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(input())\n        s = input().strip()\n        test_cases.append((n, s))\n\n    can_form_abacaba(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies that worked, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
