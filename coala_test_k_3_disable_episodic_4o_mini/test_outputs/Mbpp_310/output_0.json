    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and converts it into a tuple where each character of the string is an individual element in the tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each character in the input string and collect them into a tuple. Since tuples are immutable, we can use a list to gather the characters first and then convert that list into a tuple before returning it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `string_to_tuple` that takes a string as an argument.\n   - Initialize an empty list to hold the characters.\n   - Loop through each character in the string:\n     - Append each character to the list.\n   - Convert the list to a tuple.\n   - Return the tuple.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef string_to_tuple(s: str) -> tuple:\n    # Initialize an empty list to hold characters\n    char_list = []\n    \n    # Loop through each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # Append each character to the list\n        char_list.append(char)\n    \n    # Convert the list to a tuple\n    result_tuple = tuple(char_list)\n    \n    # Return the tuple\n    return result_tuple\n```",
