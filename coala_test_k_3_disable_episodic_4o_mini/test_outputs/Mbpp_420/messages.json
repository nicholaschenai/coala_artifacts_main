The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, including only every Kth Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.\n\n    The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. \n\n    The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def fibonacci(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\n    def S(N, K):\n        sum_fib = 0\n        for i in range(0, N + 1):\n            if i % K == 0:\n                sum_fib += fibonacci(i)\n        return sum_fib\n    ``` \n\n    Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I learned that the series can be derived from a mathematical formula rather than through iterative summation. The official solution uses a direct formula to compute the N'th term efficiently, which is more optimal than my initial approach of summing squares.\n\n    The key insight from the official solution is the use of the formula:\n    - For N > 1, the N'th term can be calculated as:\n      \\[\n      T(N) = \\frac{(N-2 + 1)(2(N-2) + 3)(N-2 + 2)}{6}\n      \\]\n    This formula allows for constant time computation of the N'th term, significantly improving performance, especially for larger values of N (up to 10,000) and multiple test cases (up to 10,000).\n\n    My approach, which involved iterating through the first (N-1) natural numbers to compute the sum of squares, was less efficient and could lead to longer execution times for larger inputs. The official solution's method is not only more concise but also avoids unnecessary loops, making it a better choice for this problem.\n\n    In future problems, I should consider looking for mathematical patterns or formulas that can simplify calculations, especially when dealing with series or sequences. This experience reinforces the importance of analyzing the problem for potential mathematical solutions rather than relying solely on iterative methods.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
