    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to find the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within a given list of integers. This means we need to identify a sequence of numbers in the list that, when multiplied together, gives the highest possible product.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array while keeping track of two values: the maximum product ending at the current position and the minimum product ending at the current position. The reason for tracking the minimum product is that a negative number can turn a small product into a large product when multiplied. At each step, we will update the maximum product found so far.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize max_product to the first element of the array\n   Initialize current_max to the first element of the array\n   Initialize current_min to the first element of the array\n\n   For each element in the array starting from the second element:\n       If the current element is negative:\n           Swap current_max and current_min\n       Update current_max to be the maximum of (current element, current_max * current element)\n       Update current_min to be the minimum of (current element, current_min * current element)\n       Update max_product to be the maximum of (max_product, current_max)\n\n   Return max_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_subarray_product(arr):\n    # Initialize max_product to the first element of the array\n    max_product = arr[0]\n    # Initialize current_max and current_min to the first element of the array\n    current_max = arr[0]\n    current_min = arr[0]\n\n    # Iterate through the array starting from the second element\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] < 0:\n            # If the current element is negative, swap current_max and current_min\n            current_max, current_min = current_min, current_max\n        \n        # Update current_max to be the maximum of the current element or current_max * current element\n        current_max = max(arr[i], current_max * arr[i])\n        # Update current_min to be the minimum of the current element or current_min * current element\n        current_min = min(arr[i], current_min * arr[i])\n        \n        # Update max_product to be the maximum of itself and current_max\n        max_product = max(max_product, current_max)\n\n    # Return the maximum product found\n    return max_product\n```",
