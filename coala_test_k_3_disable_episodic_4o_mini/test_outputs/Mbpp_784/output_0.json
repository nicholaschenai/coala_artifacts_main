    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of integers and finds the product of the first even number and the first odd number in that list. If either an even or an odd number is not present, the function should handle that appropriately.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the list of integers.\n   - We will keep track of the first even number we encounter and the first odd number we encounter.\n   - Once we find both an even and an odd number, we will multiply them together and return the result.\n   - If we finish iterating through the list without finding either an even or an odd number, we will return a default value (like 0) or handle it as needed.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function mul_even_odd(numbers):\n       initialize first_even to None\n       initialize first_odd to None\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even and first_even is None:\n               set first_even to number\n           if number is odd and first_odd is None:\n               set first_odd to number\n           \n           if both first_even and first_odd are found:\n               return first_even * first_odd\n       \n       return 0  # or some indication that one of them was not found\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef mul_even_odd(numbers):\n    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers\n    first_even = None\n    first_odd = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of numbers\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0 and first_even is None:\n            first_even = number  # Store the first even number\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0 and first_odd is None:\n            first_odd = number  # Store the first odd number\n        \n        # If both even and odd numbers have been found, return their product\n        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n            return first_even * first_odd\n    \n    # If we finish the loop without finding both, return 0\n    return 0\n```",
