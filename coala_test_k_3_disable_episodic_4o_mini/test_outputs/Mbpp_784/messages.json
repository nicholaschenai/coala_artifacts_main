The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.\n\n    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.\n\n    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def largest_prime_factor(n):\n        largest_prime = 1\n        while n % 2 == 0:\n            largest_prime = 2\n            n //= 2\n        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n            while n % i == 0:\n                largest_prime = i\n                n //= i\n        if n > 2:\n            largest_prime = n\n        return largest_prime\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        index = 1\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n            index += 1\n        \n            prime_count = {}\n        \n            for number in elements:\n                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)\n                if largest_prime in prime_count:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1\n                else:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1\n        \n            max_count = -1\n            result_prime = -1\n        \n            for prime, count in prime_count.items():\n                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result_prime):\n                    max_count = count\n                    result_prime = prime\n        \n            results.append(result_prime)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of p allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers A and B. The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.\n\n    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. \n\n    Key code snippet for counting divisors:\n    ```python\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
