    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of integers and removes all the odd numbers from that list, returning a new list that contains only the even numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given list and check each number. If a number is even (i.e., divisible by 2), we will add it to a new list. At the end of the iteration, we will return the new list that contains only the even numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_odd(numbers):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even:\n               add number to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef remove_odd(numbers):\n    # Create an empty list to store even numbers\n    result = []\n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If it is even, add it to the result list\n            result.append(number)\n    # Return the list of even numbers\n    return result\n```",
