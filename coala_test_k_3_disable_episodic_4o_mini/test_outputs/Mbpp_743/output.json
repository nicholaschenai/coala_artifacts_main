    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of items and a number indicating how many positions to rotate the list to the right. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the number is `2`, the result should be `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To rotate the list to the right, we can determine the effective number of rotations needed by using the modulo operation with the length of the list. This is because rotating a list by its length results in the same list. After determining the effective rotations, we can slice the list into two parts: the last `k` elements and the rest of the list. We then concatenate these two parts to form the rotated list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function rotate_right(lst, k):\n       n = length of lst\n       if n is 0:\n           return lst\n       k = k % n  // effective rotations\n       return lst[-k:] + lst[:-k]  // concatenate last k elements with the rest\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef rotate_right(lst, k):\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(lst)\n    \n    # If the list is empty, return it as is\n    if n == 0:\n        return lst\n    \n    # Calculate effective rotations needed\n    k = k % n\n    \n    # Return the rotated list by slicing\n    return lst[-k:] + lst[:-k]\n\n```",
