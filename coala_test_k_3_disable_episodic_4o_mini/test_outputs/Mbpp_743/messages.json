The function should rotate the elements of the list to the right by the specified number of positions. For example, if we have a list of numbers and we want to rotate it by 3 positions to the right, the last three elements of the list should move to the front, and the rest of the elements should shift to the right.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To rotate the list to the right, we can use the following approach:\n   - First, determine the effective number of rotations needed. If the number of rotations is greater than the length of the list, we can use the modulus operator to find the equivalent smaller number of rotations.\n   - Next, we can split the list into two parts: the last 'n' elements (where 'n' is the number of rotations) and the rest of the list.\n   - Finally, we concatenate these two parts to form the rotated list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function rotate_right(lst, n):\n       length = length of lst\n       if length is 0:\n           return lst\n       n = n % length  // effective rotations\n       if n is 0:\n           return lst\n       part1 = last n elements of lst\n       part2 = first (length - n) elements of lst\n       return part1 + part2\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef rotate_right(lst, n):\n    # Get the length of the list\n    length = len(lst)\n    \n    # If the list is empty, return it as is\n    if length == 0:\n        return lst\n    \n    # Calculate effective rotations needed\n    n = n % length\n    \n    # If no rotations are needed, return the original list\n    if n == 0:\n        return lst\n    \n    # Split the list into two parts\n    part1 = lst[-n:]  # Last n elements\n    part2 = lst[:-n]  # All elements except the last n\n    \n    # Concatenate the two parts and return the result\n    return part1 + part2\n```"

The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved calculating the sum of specific elements from a sorted list of all possible sums of continuous subarrays derived from a given list of positive integers. The key steps included generating all subarray sums, sorting them, and then summing the elements between specified indices.\n\n    The solution effectively utilized nested loops to compute the subarray sums, which were then sorted. The final sum was calculated by iterating over the specified range of indices. The implementation was straightforward and adhered to the constraints provided, ensuring that the result was returned modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n    One important takeaway is the efficiency of generating subarray sums using a cumulative approach, where the current sum is updated as we extend the subarray. This method avoids recalculating sums from scratch, making it more efficient. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def rangeSum(self, nums: list[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n            subarray_sums = []\n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n            subarray_sums.sort()\n            total_sum = 0\n            for index in range(left - 1, right):\n                total_sum += subarray_sums[index]\n            return total_sum % (10**9 + 7)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data structures to achieve the desired results.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, specifically after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements. The key insight was recognizing that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to the Pisano period. This allowed for efficient computation even for very large values of N (up to 10^18).\n\n    The solution was structured into three main functions: one to compute the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using the Pisano period, another to determine the last remaining number after the removal process, and a final function to handle input and output. The approach of reducing N by half in each iteration of the removal process was effective, as it directly correlated with the position in the last digits array.\n\n    The final implementation passed the provided test cases successfully, demonstrating that the strategy of leveraging the periodicity of Fibonacci last digits was both efficient and effective. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The solution is useful for similar problems involving sequences and periodicity. \n\n    Key code snippets:\n    ```python\n    def last_digit_fibonacci(n):\n        # Calculate the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using Pisano period\n        ...\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(n):\n        # Find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements\n        ...\n\n    def solve():\n        # Handle input and output\n        ...\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is because rotating a list by its length results in the same list.
