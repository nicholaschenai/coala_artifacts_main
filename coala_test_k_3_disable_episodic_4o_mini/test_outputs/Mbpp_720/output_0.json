    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a tuple and a dictionary as inputs. The function should return a new tuple that includes all the elements of the original tuple followed by the dictionary.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to combine the elements of the input tuple with the dictionary. We can achieve this by converting the dictionary into a single element (which is the dictionary itself) and then creating a new tuple that includes all the elements from the original tuple followed by this dictionary.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `add_dict_to_tuple` that takes two parameters: a tuple and a dictionary.\n   - Create a new tuple that consists of the original tuple elements followed by the dictionary.\n   - Return the new tuple.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef add_dict_to_tuple(input_tuple, input_dict):\n    # Create a new tuple that includes all elements from the input tuple\n    # followed by the input dictionary\n    new_tuple = input_tuple + (input_dict,)\n    # Return the new tuple\n    return new_tuple\n```",
