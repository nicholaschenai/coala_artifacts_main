The goal is to sum all unique elements, meaning that each distinct number should be counted once, regardless of how many times it appears in the list.\n\nHere\u2019s the final Python code that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    unique_elements = set(lst)  # Create a set of unique elements\n    total_sum = sum(unique_elements)  # Sum all unique elements\n    return total_sum\n```",
