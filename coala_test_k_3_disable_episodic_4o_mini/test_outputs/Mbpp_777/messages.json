The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2.

The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.\n\n    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.\n\n    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design.

The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.\n\n    The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. \n\n    The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def fibonacci(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\n    def S(N, K):\n        sum_fib = 0\n        for i in range(0, N + 1):\n            if i % K == 0:\n                sum_fib += fibonacci(i)\n        return sum_fib\n    ``` \n\n    Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
