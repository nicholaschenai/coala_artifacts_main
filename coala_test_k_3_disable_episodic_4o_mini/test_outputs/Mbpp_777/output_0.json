    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the sum of all unique elements in a list, meaning that if an element appears more than once, it should only be counted once in the sum.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the list. After counting, we can iterate through the dictionary and sum only those elements that appear exactly once.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to keep track of the counts of each element.\n   - Loop through each element in the input list and update the count in the dictionary.\n   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum of non-repeated elements.\n   - Loop through the dictionary and for each element that has a count of 1, add it to the sum.\n   - Return the final sum.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(lst):\n    count_dict = {}\n    for num in lst:\n        if num in count_dict:\n            count_dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[num] = 1\n    return count_dict\n\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    count_dict = count_occurrences(lst)  # Count occurrences of each element\n    total_sum = 0\n    for num, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count == 1:  # Only add non-repeated elements\n            total_sum += num\n    return total_sum\n```",
