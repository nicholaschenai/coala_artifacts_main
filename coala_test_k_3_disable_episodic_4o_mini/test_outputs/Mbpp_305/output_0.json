If there are fewer than two such words, the function should not return anything.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the list of words.\n   - For each word, we will check if it starts with the letter 'p'.\n   - We will collect the words that start with 'p' in a separate list.\n   - Once we have collected the words, we will return the first two words from this list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function start_withp(words):\n       create an empty list called p_words\n       for each word in words:\n           if word starts with 'p':\n               add word to p_words\n           if length of p_words is 2:\n               return the first two words from p_words\n       return nothing if fewer than two words found\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef start_withp(words):\n    # Create an empty list to store words starting with 'p'\n    p_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each word in the input list\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word starts with the letter 'p'\n        if word.startswith('p'):\n            # Add the word to the p_words list\n            p_words.append(word)\n        \n        # If we have found two words, return them\n        if len(p_words) == 2:\n            return (p_words[0], p_words[1])\n    \n    # If fewer than two words starting with 'p' are found, return nothing\n```",
