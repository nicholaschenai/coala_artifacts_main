    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that counts how many of the three given integers are equal to each other. If all three integers are the same, the function should return 3. If two are the same and one is different, it should return 2. If all three are different, it should return 0.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can compare the three integers. We will check if all three are equal, if two are equal, or if none are equal. Based on these comparisons, we will return the appropriate count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function test_three_equal(a, b, c):\n       if a == b and b == c:\n           return 3\n       else if a == b or b == c or a == c:\n           return 2\n       else:\n           return 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef test_three_equal(a, b, c):\n    # Check if all three numbers are equal\n    if a == b and b == c:\n        return 3\n    # Check if any two numbers are equal\n    elif a == b or b == c or a == c:\n        return 2\n    # If none are equal\n    else:\n        return 0\n```",
