INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/801 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes three integers as input and counts how many of those integers are equal to each other. If all three integers are the same, the function should return 3. If two are the same and one is different, it should return 2. If all three are different, it should return 0.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We can compare the three integers using simple conditional statements. We will check:
   - If all three integers are equal, return 3.
   - If two integers are equal and one is different, return 2.
   - If all three integers are different, return 0.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function test_three_equal(a, b, c):
       if a == b and b == c:
           return 3
       else if a == b or a == c or b == c:
           return 2
       else:
           return 0
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to count equal numbers among three integers
def test_three_equal(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    # Check if all three numbers are equal
    if a == b and b == c:
        return 3  # All three are equal
    # Check if any two numbers are equal
    elif a == b or a == c or b == c:
        return 2  # Two are equal
    else:
        return 0  # All three are different

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of p allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers A and B. The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.

    The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.

    The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. 

    Key code snippet for counting divisors:
    ```python
    def count_divisors(n):
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
        return count
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.

    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

    In tackling the problem of determining if three adjacent sides of a cube are painted the same color, my initial approach was logically sound and correctly identified the necessary combinations of sides to check. However, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient implementation.

    **Key Insights from the Official Solution:**
    1. **Use of Indexing**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides directly. This approach simplifies the checking process by avoiding multiple conditional statements and instead iterating through predefined combinations.
  
    2. **Set for Uniqueness**: The official solution leverages the `set` data structure to check if all three colors are the same. By converting the list of colors to a set, it effectively checks for uniqueness in a single line, which is both elegant and efficient.

    3. **Control Flow**: The use of a counter (`c`) to track whether a match was found is straightforward, but the official solution could be further simplified by directly printing "YES" or "NO" based on the condition without needing an additional variable.

    **Comparison with My Approach**:
    - My solution explicitly checked each combination with multiple `or` conditions, which, while clear, could be seen as verbose compared to the official solution's use of a loop over a predefined list of combinations.
    - The official solution's use of `set` for checking color equality is a more Pythonic approach, reducing the complexity of the condition checks.

    ### Conclusion
    The official solution is more efficient in terms of readability and maintainability. It highlights the importance of leveraging built-in data structures and concise control flow in Python. In future problems, I will aim to adopt similar strategies to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective attendance frequencies. The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.

    The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.

    Key code snippets included:
    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            temp = b
            b = a % b
            a = temp
        return a

    def lcm(a, b):
        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

    def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):
        total_hours = N * 24
        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        return total_hours // lcm_value
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.
