For each substring, we will count the number of '0's and '1's, then calculate the difference between these counts. We will keep track of the maximum difference found during this process.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_length(binary_string):\n       max_difference = 0\n       for start_index from 0 to length of binary_string - 1:\n           for end_index from start_index to length of binary_string - 1:\n               substring = binary_string[start_index:end_index + 1]\n               count_0 = count of '0's in substring\n               count_1 = count of '1's in substring\n               difference = abs(count_0 - count_1)\n               if difference > max_difference:\n                   max_difference = difference\n       return max_difference\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_zeros_and_ones(s: str):\n    count_0 = 0\n    count_1 = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            count_0 += 1\n        else:\n            count_1 += 1\n    return count_0, count_1\n\ndef find_length(binary_string: str) -> int:\n    max_difference = 0\n    n = len(binary_string)\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible substrings\n    for start_index in range(n):\n        for end_index in range(start_index, n):\n            substring = binary_string[start_index:end_index + 1]\n            count_0, count_1 = count_zeros_and_ones(substring)\n            difference = abs(count_0 - count_1)\n            if difference > max_difference:\n                max_difference = difference\n                \n    return max_difference\n```",
