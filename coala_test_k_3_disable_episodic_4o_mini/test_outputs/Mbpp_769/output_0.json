    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list. This is essentially finding the difference between the two lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the first list and check if each element is present in the second list. If an element from the first list is not found in the second list, we will add it to the result list. Finally, we will return the result list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function Diff(list1, list2):\n       create an empty result list\n       for each element in list1:\n           if element is not in list2:\n               add element to result list\n       return result list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    # Create an empty result list to store the difference\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not, add it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the result list containing the difference\n    return result\n```",
