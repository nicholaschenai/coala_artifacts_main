    "raw_msg": "Given the previous insights and the requirement to return the elements from the first list that are not present in the second list while maintaining the order of their appearance, I will revise the solution accordingly.\n\nThe expected output for the test case indicates that the elements should be returned in the order they appear in the first list, but also in a way that respects the order of elements that are not in the second list.\n\nTo achieve this, I will:\n- Collect elements from `list1` that are not in `list2`.\n- Ensure that the order of elements in the output matches the order of their first appearance in `list1`.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    # Create an empty result list to store the difference\n    result = []\n    \n    # Create a set for faster lookup of elements in list2\n    set_list2 = set(list2)\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not in the second list\n        if element not in set_list2:\n            # If not, add it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the result list containing the difference\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a set for `list2` to improve the lookup time when checking if an element from `list1` is present in `list2`. It should now correctly return the elements from `list1` that are not in `list2`, while maintaining the expected order.",
