INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/605 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that determines whether a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To check if a number is prime, we can follow these steps:
   - If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
   - If the number is 2, it is prime (the only even prime number).
   - For numbers greater than 2, we can check for factors from 2 up to the square root of the number. If we find any factors in this range, the number is not prime; otherwise, it is prime.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function prime_num(n):
       if n <= 1:
           return False
       if n == 2:
           return True
       if n is even:
           return False
       for i from 3 to sqrt(n) step 2:
           if n is divisible by i:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

def is_divisible(n, i):
    return n % i == 0

def prime_num(n):
    # Check if the number is less than or equal to 1
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    # Check if the number is 2
    if n == 2:
        return True
    # Check if the number is even
    if is_even(n):
        return False
    # Check for factors from 3 to the square root of n
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if is_divisible(n, i):
            return False
    # If no factors were found, the number is prime
    return True

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.

    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.

    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def largest_prime_factor(n):
        largest_prime = 1
        while n % 2 == 0:
            largest_prime = 2
            n //= 2
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            while n % i == 0:
                largest_prime = i
                n //= i
        if n > 2:
            largest_prime = n
        return largest_prime

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        index = 1
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))
            index += 1
        
            prime_count = {}
        
            for number in elements:
                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)
                if largest_prime in prime_count:
                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1
                else:
                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1
        
            max_count = -1
            result_prime = -1
        
            for prime, count in prime_count.items():
                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result_prime):
                    max_count = count
                    result_prime = prime
        
            results.append(result_prime)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

    Title: Primality tests
    Part: 1/2
    # Primality tests

    This article describes multiple algorithms to determine if a number is prime or not.

    ## Trial division

    By definition a prime number doesn't have any divisors other than $1$ and itself.
    A composite number has at least one additional divisor, let's call it $d$.
    Naturally $\frac{n}{d}$ is also a divisor of $n$.
    It's easy to see, that either $d \le \sqrt{n}$ or $\frac{n}{d} \le \sqrt{n}$, therefore one of the divisors $d$ and $\frac{n}{d}$ is $\le \sqrt{n}$.
    We can use this information to check for primality.

    We try to find a non-trivial divisor, by checking if any of the numbers between $2$ and $\sqrt{n}$ is a divisor of $n$.
    If it is a divisor, than $n$ is definitely not prime, otherwise it is.

    ```cpp
    bool isPrime(int x) {
        for (int d = 2; d * d <= x; d++) {
            if (x % d == 0)
                return false;
        }
        return x >= 2;
    }
    ```

    This is the simplest form of a prime check.
    You can optimize this function quite a bit, for instance by only checking all odd numbers in the loop, since the only even prime number is 2.
    Multiple such optimizations are described in the article about [integer factorization](factorization.md).

    ## Fermat primality test

    This is a probabilistic test.

    Fermat's little theorem (see also [Euler's totient function](phi-function.md)) states, that for a prime number $p$ and a coprime integer $a$ the following equation holds:

    $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p$$

    In general this theorem doesn't hold for composite numbers.

    This can be used to create a primality test.
    We pick an integer $2 \le a \le p - 2$, and check if the equation holds or not.
    If it doesn't hold, e.g. $a^{p-1} \not\equiv 1 \bmod p$, we know that $p$ cannot be a prime number.
    In this case we call the base $a$ a *Fermat witness* for the compositeness of $p$.

    However it is also possible, that the equation holds for a composite number.
    So if the equation holds, we don't have a proof for primality.
    We only can say that $p$ is *probably prime*.
    If it turns out that the number is actually composite, we call the base $a$ a *Fermat liar*.

    By running the test for all possible bases $a$, we can actually prove that a number is prime.
    However this is not done in practice, since this is a lot more effort that just doing *trial division*.
    Instead the test will be repeated multiple times with random choices for $a$.
    If we find no witness for the compositeness, it is very likely that the number is in fact prime.

    ```cpp
    bool probablyPrimeFermat(int n, int iter=5) {
        if (n < 4)
            return n == 2 || n == 3;

        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {
            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);
            if (binpower(a, n - 1, n) != 1)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    ```

    We use [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md) to efficiently compute the power $a^{p-1}$.

    There is one bad news though:
    there exist some composite numbers where $a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \bmod n$ holds for all $a$ coprime to $n$, for instance for the number $561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17$.
    Such numbers are called *Carmichael numbers*.
    The Fermat primality test can identify these numbers only, if we have immense luck and choose a base $a$ with $\gcd(a, n) \ne 1$.

    The Fermat test is still be used in practice, as it is very fast and Carmichael numbers are very rare.
    E.g. there only exist 646 such numbers below $10^9$.

    ## Miller-Rabin primality test

    The Miller-Rabin test extends the ideas from the Fermat test.

    For an odd number $n$, $n-1$ is even and we can factor out all powers of 2.
    We can write:

    $$n - 1 = 2^s \cdot d,~\text{with}~d~\text{odd}.$$

    This allows us to factorize the equation of Fermat's little theorem:

    $$\begin{array}{rl}
    a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \bmod n &\Longleftrightarrow a^{2^s d} - 1 \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-1} d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\quad\vdots \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) \cdots (a^{d} + 1) (a^{d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    \end{array}$$

    If $n$ is prime, then $n$ has to divide one of these factors.
    And in the Miller-Rabin primality test we check exactly that statement, which is a more stricter version of the statement of the Fermat test.
    For a base $2 \le a \le n-2$ we check if either

    $$a^d \equiv 1 \bmod n$$

    holds or

    $$a^{2^r d} \equiv -1 \bmod n$$

    holds for some $0 \le r \le s - 1$.

    If we found a base $a$ which doesn't satisfy any of the above equalities, than we found a *witness* for the compositeness of $n$.
    In this case we have proven that $n$ is not a prime number.

    Similar to the Fermat test, it is also possible that the set of equations is satisfied for a composite number.
    In that case the base $a$ is called a *strong liar*.
    If a base $a$ satisfies the equations (one of them), $n$ is only *strong probable prime*.
    However, there are no numbers like the Carmichael numbers, where all non-trivial bases lie.
    In fact it is possible to show, that at most $\frac{1}{4}$ of the bases can be strong liars.
    If $n$ is composite, we have a probability of $\ge 75\%$ that a random base will tell us that it is composite.
    By doing multiple iterations, choosing different random bases, we can tell with very high probability if the number is truly prime or if it is composite.

    Here is an implementation for 64 bit integer.

    ```cpp
    using u64 = uint64_t;
    using u128 = __uint128_t;

    u64 binpower(u64 base, u64 e, u64 mod) {
        u64 result = 1;
        base %= mod;
        while (e) {
            if (e & 1)
                result = (u128)result * base % mod;
            base = (u128)base * base % mod;
            e >>= 1;
        }
        return result;
    }

    bool check_composite(u64 n, u64 a, u64 d, int s) {
        u64 x = binpower(a, d, n);
        if (x == 1 || x == n - 1)
            return false;
        for (int r = 1; r < s; r++) {
            x = (u128)x * x % n;
            if (x == n - 1)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    };

    bool MillerRabin(u64 n, int iter=5) { // returns true if n is probably prime, else returns false.
        if (n < 4)
            return n == 2 || n == 3;

        int s = 0;
        u64 d = n - 1;
        while ((d & 1) == 0) {
            d >>= 1;
            s++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {
            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);
            if (check_composite(n, a, d, s))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    ```

    Before the Miller-Rabin test you can test additionally if one of the first few prime numbers is a divisor.
    This can speed up the test by a lot, since most composite numbers have very small prime divisors.
    E.g. $88\%$ of all numbers have a prime factors smaller than $100$.

    ### Deterministic version

    Miller showed that it is possible to make the algorithm deterministic by only checking all bases $\le O((\ln n)^2)$.
    Bach later gave a concrete bound, it is only necessary to test all bases $a \le 2 \ln(n)^2$.

    This is still a pretty large number of bases.
    So people have invested quite a lot of computation power into finding lower bounds.
    It turns out, for testing a 32 bit integer it is only necessary to check the first 4 prime bases: 2, 3, 5 and 7.
    The smallest composite number that fails this test is $3,215,031,751 = 151 \cdot 751 \cdot 28351$.
    And for testing 64 bit integer it is enough to check the first 12 prime bases: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.

    This results in the following deterministic implementation:

    ```cpp
    bool MillerRabin(u64 n) { // returns true if n is prime, else returns false.
        if (n < 2)
            return false;

        int r = 0;
        u64 d = n - 1;
        while ((d & 1) == 0) {
            d >>= 1;
            r++;
        }

        for (int a : {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37}) {
            if (n == a)
                return true;
            if (check_composite(n, a, d, r))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/605 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that checks whether a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if a number is prime, we can check for divisibility by all integers starting from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these integers, it is not prime. If it is not divisible by any of them, then it is prime.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function is_prime(n):
       if n <= 1:
           return False
       for i from 2 to sqrt(n):
           if n % i == 0:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    # Check if n is less than or equal to 1
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    # Check for factors from 2 to the square root of n
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:  # If n is divisible by i, it's not prime
            return False
