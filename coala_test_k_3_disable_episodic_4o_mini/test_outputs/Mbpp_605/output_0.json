    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that checks whether a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if a number is prime, we can check for divisibility by all integers starting from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these integers, it is not prime. If it is not divisible by any of them, then it is prime.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_prime(n):\n       if n <= 1:\n           return False\n       for i from 2 to sqrt(n):\n           if n % i == 0:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    # Check if n is less than or equal to 1\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    # Check for factors from 2 to the square root of n\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:  # If n is divisible by i, it's not prime\n            return False\n    return True  # If no divisors were found, n is prime\n\ndef prime_num(n: int) -> bool:\n    return is_prime(n)  # Call the helper function to check for primality\n```",
