    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence from a list of integers. This subsequence must include a specific element located at index `k`, which comes after a given index `i`. \n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list up to index `i` to find all increasing subsequences that can be formed. We will then check if we can include the element at index `k` in these subsequences. The goal is to find the maximum sum of these valid subsequences.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n       max_sum = 0\n       for j from 0 to i-1:\n           if arr[j] < arr[k]:  // Check if we can include arr[k]\n               current_sum = arr[j] + arr[k]\n               for m from 0 to j-1:\n                   if arr[m] < arr[j]:  // Check for increasing condition\n                       current_sum += arr[m]\n               max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n       return max_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n    # Initialize the maximum sum to 0\n    max_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the elements from the start to index i-1\n    for j in range(i):\n        # Check if the current element can be part of the increasing subsequence with arr[k]\n        if arr[j] < arr[k]:\n            # Start the current sum with arr[j] and arr[k]\n            current_sum = arr[j] + arr[k]\n            \n            # Check for other elements before j to form an increasing subsequence\n            for m in range(j):\n                if arr[m] < arr[j]:  # Ensure increasing condition\n                    current_sum += arr[m]\n            \n            # Update the maximum sum found\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n    \n    return max_sum\n```",
