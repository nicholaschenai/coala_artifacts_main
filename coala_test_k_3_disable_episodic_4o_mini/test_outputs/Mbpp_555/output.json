    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the difference between two values: the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. This can be done using the formula \\( \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\).\n   - Calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. This can be done using the formula \\( \\text{Sum of cubes} = \\left(\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\\right)^2 \\).\n   - Finally, we will find the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function difference(n):\n       sum_n = n * (n + 1) / 2  // Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers\n       sum_cubes = sum_n * sum_n  // Calculate the sum of cubes using the square of the sum_n\n       return sum_cubes - sum_n  // Return the difference\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sum_of_natural_numbers(n):\n    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\ndef sum_of_cubes(n):\n    # Calculate the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers\n    sum_n = sum_of_natural_numbers(n)\n    return sum_n * sum_n  # Square of the sum of the first n natural numbers\n\ndef difference(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first n natural numbers\n    sum_n = sum_of_natural_numbers(n)  # Get the sum of the first n natural numbers\n    sum_cubes = sum_of_cubes(n)  # Get the sum of cubes\n    return sum_cubes - sum_n  # Return the difference\n```",
