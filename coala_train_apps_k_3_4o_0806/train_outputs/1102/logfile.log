[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----EXPLANATION:-----

Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   Miu has a phone keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 maps to a set of letters. She types a string of digits, and we need to determine how many possible letter combinations can be formed from this string. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters:
     - 2: 3 letters (A, B, C)
     - 3: 3 letters (D, E, F)
     - 4: 3 letters (G, H, I)
     - 5: 3 letters (J, K, L)
     - 6: 3 letters (M, N, O)
     - 7: 4 letters (P, Q, R, S)
     - 8: 3 letters (T, U, V)
     - 9: 4 letters (W, X, Y, Z)
   - For each test case, calculate the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the number of letters for each digit in the string.
   - Use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the result is manageable.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function to map digits to the number of letters:
     Create a dictionary with keys as digits and values as the number of letters

   For each test case:
     Initialize a variable `result` to 1
     For each digit in the string S:
       Multiply `result` by the number of letters corresponding to the digit
       Take modulo 1000000007 of `result`
     Print the `result`
   ```

### Python Code

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def countPossibleStrings(T, test_cases):
    # Define the mapping of digits to the number of letters
    digit_to_letters_count = {
        '2': 3,  # ABC
        '3': 3,  # DEF
        '4': 3,  # GHI
        '5': 3,  # JKL
        '6': 3,  # MNO
        '7': 4,  # PQRS
        '8': 3,  # TUV
        '9': 4   # WXYZ
    }
    
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    # Process each test case
    for S in test_cases:
        result = 1
        # Calculate the number of possible strings for the given S
        for digit in S:
            result *= digit_to_letters_count[digit]
            result %= MOD  # Take modulo to keep the number manageable
        print(result)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# First line is the number of test cases
T = int(data[0])

# The following lines are the test cases
test_cases = data[1:T+1]

# Call the function with the input data
countPossibleStrings(T, test_cases)
```

This code reads input from standard input, processes each test case to calculate the number of possible strings, and prints the result for each test case. The results are computed using the mapping of digits to the number of letters and are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure they remain within a manageable range.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        ### Step-by-Step Analysis

        1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.

        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.

        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.

        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.

        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.

        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.

        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.

        ### Potential Issues

        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.

        ### Correction

        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.

        ### Corrected Code

        ```python
        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod
            return factorials, inverses

        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's correct the solution by ensuring that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This will allow the program to execute and produce the expected output. Here is the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod
            return factorials, inverses

        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod

        def solve_queries():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            MOD = 10**9 + 7
            max_n = 4000
            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, MOD)
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                Q = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                for _ in range(Q):
                    I = int(data[index])
                    K = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)
                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD

        # Call the function to execute the solution
        solve_queries()
        ```

        This code should now correctly read input, process each test case, and output the results as expected. The main issue was that the function `solve_queries()` was not being called, which has now been fixed.

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(I-1, K-1)\).

        3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \(2^{N-I}\) possible combinations.

        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            for i from 2 to max_n:
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod-2, mod)
            for i from max_n-1 down to 1:
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod
            return factorials, inverses

        function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod

        function solve_queries(T, queries, mod):
            max_n = 4000
            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod)
            results = []
            for each test case:
                read N and Q
                for each query:
                    read I and K
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverses, mod)
                        count_greater = pow(2, N-I, mod)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % mod
                        results.append(result)
            return results

                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD

            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")
        ```

        This code efficiently handles the problem by precomputing factorials and their inverses, allowing for quick computation of binomial coefficients and powers of 2, which are essential for solving each query.

Miu has a smartphone with a keypad where each digit corresponds to a set of letters. She typed a string of digits, and we need to determine how many possible strings of letters can be formed from this sequence of digits. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Mapping Digits to Letters**: Each digit from 2 to 9 maps to a set of letters:
   - 2 -> ABC (3 letters)
   - 3 -> DEF (3 letters)
   - 4 -> GHI (3 letters)
   - 5 -> JKL (3 letters)
   - 6 -> MNO (3 letters)
   - 7 -> PQRS (4 letters)
   - 8 -> TUV (3 letters)
   - 9 -> WXYZ (4 letters)

2. **Calculate Possible Combinations**: For each digit in the string, determine the number of possible letters it can represent. Multiply these numbers together to get the total number of possible strings.

3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Explanation

- **Mapping**: We map each digit to the number of possible letters it can represent.

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Miu has a smartphone with a keypad where each digit corresponds to a set of letters. She typed a string of digits, and we need to determine how many possible strings of letters can be formed from this sequence of digits. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Mapping Digits to Letters**: Each digit from 2 to 9 maps to a set of letters:
   - 2 -> ABC (3 letters)
   - 3 -> DEF (3 letters)
   - 4 -> GHI (3 letters)
   - 5 -> JKL (3 letters)
   - 6 -> MNO (3 letters)
   - 7 -> PQRS (4 letters)
   - 8 -> TUV (3 letters)
   - 9 -> WXYZ (4 letters)

2. **Calculate Possible Combinations**: For each digit in the string, determine the number of possible letters it can represent. Multiply these numbers together to get the total number of possible strings.

3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Pseudocode

```
function count_possible_strings(T, test_cases):
    MOD = 1000000007
    digit_to_count = {
        '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3,
        '7': 4, '8': 3, '9': 4
    }
    results = []
    for each test case S in test_cases:
        count = 1
        for each digit in S:
            count = (count * digit_to_count[digit]) % MOD
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

### Final Python Code

```python
def count_possible_strings(T, test_cases):
    MOD = 1000000007
    digit_to_count = {
        '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3,
        '7': 4, '8': 3, '9': 4
    }
    results = []
    for S in test_cases:
        count = 1
        for digit in S:
            count = (count * digit_to_count[digit]) % MOD
        results.append(count)
    return results

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    test_cases = data[1:T + 1]
    
    results = count_possible_strings(T, test_cases)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Mapping**: We map each digit to the number of possible letters it can represent.
- **Computation**: For each test case, we iterate over the string of digits, multiplying the number of possibilities for each digit, and take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- **Output**: We print the result for each test case.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was mapping digits on a phone keypad to their corresponding letters and calculating the number of possible letter combinations for a given sequence of digits. The main challenge was efficiently computing the total number of combinations for potentially large input sizes, while ensuring the result is within the bounds of typical integer operations by using modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The strategy that worked was straightforward: use a dictionary to map each digit to the number of letters it represents, then iterate over each digit in the input string, multiplying the number of possibilities for each digit. This approach leverages the fact that the number of combinations is the product of the possibilities for each digit.

The solution was implemented efficiently by reading input, processing each test case, and outputting the results. The use of modulo operation ensured that the results remained manageable even for large inputs. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding how to map inputs to outputs and the utility of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers.

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution was effective in addressing the requirements. However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights:

1. **Digit Mapping**: Both solutions correctly map each digit to the number of possible letters. My solution used a dictionary for this mapping, which is clear and easy to maintain. The official solution uses conditional checks to determine the number of letters, which is less intuitive but still functional.

2. **Iterative Calculation**: The official solution processes the digits from right to left by repeatedly taking the modulus and dividing by 10. This approach is more manual compared to iterating over a string, but it achieves the same result.

3. **Modulo Operation**: Both solutions correctly apply the modulo operation to handle large numbers, ensuring the result stays within the bounds of typical integer operations.

4. **Edge Cases**: The official solution includes a check for when the result is 1, printing "0" instead. This seems to handle a specific edge case where no valid string can be formed, which wasn't explicitly addressed in my solution. However, given the constraints, this situation should not occur with valid input.

Overall, the official solution is more manual in its approach, using basic arithmetic operations to process the input. My solution, using a dictionary and string iteration, is more readable and maintainable. Both approaches are valid, but the choice depends on the preference for clarity versus manual control.
