If the weights of the rocks are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If the weights are different, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. We need to determine the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock, or 0 if no rocks are left.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nThe problem is similar to a partition problem where we want to split the stones into two groups such that the difference between the sums of the two groups is minimized. This is because smashing two stones is equivalent to reducing the total weight by twice the weight of the smaller group.\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.\n2. Use dynamic programming to find the maximum possible sum of a subset of stones that does not exceed half of the total weight.\n3. The smallest possible weight of the last stone is the difference between the total weight and twice this maximum subset sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.\n2. Initialize a boolean DP array `dp` of size `total_weight // 2 + 1` with `dp[0] = True`.\n3. For each stone weight:\n   - Iterate backwards through the DP array from `total_weight // 2` to the stone weight.\n   - Update `dp[j]` to `True` if `dp[j - stone]` is `True`.\n4. Find the largest `j` for which `dp[j]` is `True`.\n5. Return `total_weight - 2 * j`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Calculate the total weight of all stones\n        total_weight = sum(stones)\n        \n        # The target is to find the maximum weight we can achieve that is <= total_weight // 2\n        target = total_weight // 2\n        \n        # Initialize a DP array where dp[i] means whether a sum of i can be achieved\n        dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # Base case: a sum of 0 is always achievable\n        \n        # Process each stone\n        for stone in stones:\n            # Update the dp array from back to front\n            for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n        \n        # Find the largest j for which dp[j] is True\n        for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n            if dp[j]:\n                # The smallest possible weight of the last stone\n                return total_weight - 2 * j\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the optimal way to partition the stones into two groups with minimal difference in their total weights. The time complexity is O(n * total_weight), where n is the number of stones."

programming}\n\n    \\key{Dynamic programming}\n    is a technique that combines the correctness\n    of complete search and the efficiency\n    of greedy algorithms.\n    Dynamic programming can be applied if the\n    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems\n    that can be solved independently.\n\n    There are two uses for dynamic programming:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item\n

to calculate the total number of\n    possible solutions.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    We will first see how dynamic programming can\n    be used to find an optimal solution,\n    and then we will use the same idea for\n    counting the solutions.\n\n    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone\n    in every competitive programmer's career.\n    While the basic idea is simple,\n    the challenge is how to apply\n    dynamic programming to different problems.\n    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems\n    that are a good starting point.\n\n    \\section{Coin problem}\n\n    We first focus on a problem that we\n    have already seen in Chapter 6:\n    Given a set of coin values $\\texttt{coins} = \\{c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_k\\}$\n    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to\n    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.\n\n    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a\n    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest\n    possible coin.\n    The greedy algorithm works, for example,\n    when the coins are the euro coins,\n    but in the general case the greedy algorithm\n    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.\n\n    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently\n    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm\n    works for any coin set.\n    The dynamic programming\n    algorithm is based on a recursive function\n    that goes through all possibilities how to\n    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.\n    However, the dynamic programming\n    algorithm is efficient because\n    it uses \\emph{memoization} and\n    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Recursive formulation}\n\n    The idea in dynamic programming is to\n    formulate the problem recursively so\n    that the solution to the problem can be\n    calculated from solutions to smaller\n    subproblems.\n    In the coin problem, a natural recursive\n    problem is as follows:\n    what is the smallest number of coins\n    required to form a sum $x$?\n\n    Let $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    denote the minimum\n    number of coins required for a sum $x$.\n    The values of the function depend on the\n    values of the coins.\n    For example, if $\\texttt{coins} = \\{1,3,4\\}$,\n    the first values of the function are as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    \\texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    For example, $\\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,\n    because at least 3 coins are needed\n    to form the sum 10.\n    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.\n\n    The essential property of $\\texttt{solve}$ is\n    that its values can be\n    recursively calculated from its smaller values.\n    The idea is to focus on the \\emph{first}\n    coin that we choose for the sum.\n    For example, in the above scenario,\n    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.\n    If we first choose coin 1,\n    the remaining task is to form the sum 9\n    using the minimum number of coins,\n    which is a subproblem of the original problem.\n    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.\n    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula\n    to calculate the minimum number of coins:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\min( & \\texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).\n    \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case of the recursion is $\\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    For example,\n    \\[ \\texttt{solve}(10) = \\texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \\texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \\texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\\]\n\n    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function\n    that calculates the minimum number of\n    coins needed to form a sum $x$:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n                   \\infty               & x < 0\\\\\n                   0               & x = 0\\\\\n                   \\min_{c \\in \\texttt{coins}} \\texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n\n    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\\infty$,\n    because it is impossible to form a negative\n    sum of money.\n    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through\n    all possibilities how to choose the first coin\n    of the sum.\n\n    Once a recursive function that solves the problem\n    has been found,\n    we can directly implement a solution in C++\n    (the constant \\texttt{INF} denotes infinity):\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Still, this function is not efficient,\n    because there may be an exponential number of ways\n    to construct the sum.\n    However, next we will see how to make the\n    function efficient using a technique called memoization.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Using memoization}\n\n    \\index{memoization}\n\n    The idea of dynamic programming is to use\n    \\key{memoization} to efficiently calculate\n    values of a recursive function.\n    This means that the values of the function\n    are stored in an array after calculating them.\n    For each parameter, the value of the function\n    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,\n    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.\n\n    In this problem, we use arrays\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    bool ready[N];\n    int value[N];\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    where $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates\n    whether the value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,\n    and if it is, $\\texttt{value}[x]$\n    contains this value.\n    The constant $N$ has been chosen so\n    that all required values fit in the arrays.\n\n    Now the function can be efficiently\n    implemented as follows:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        if (ready[x]) return value[x];\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        value[x] = best;\n        ready[x] = true;\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function handles the base cases\n    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.\n    Then the function checks from\n    $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ if\n    $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored\n    in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    and if it is, the function directly returns it.\n    Otherwise the function calculates the value\n    of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    recursively and stores it in $\\texttt{value}[x]$.\n\n    This function works efficiently,\n    because the answer for each parameter $x$\n    is calculated recursively only once.\n    After a value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the\n    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.\n    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(nk)$,\n    where $n$ is the target sum and $k$ is the number of coins.\n\n    Note that we can also \\emph{iteratively}\n    construct the array \\texttt{value} using\n    a loop that simply calculates all the values\n    of $\\texttt{solve}$ for parameters $0 \\ldots n\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Divide and Conquer DP\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Divide and Conquer DP\n\n    Divide and Conquer is a dynamic programming optimization.\n\n    ### Preconditions\n    Some dynamic programming problems have a recurrence of this form: \n\n    $$\n    dp(i, j) = \\min_{0 \\leq k \\leq j} \\\\{ dp(i - 1, k - 1) + C(k, j) \\\\}\n    $$\n\n    where $C(k, j)$ is a cost function and $dp(i, j) = 0$ when $j \\lt 0$. \n\n    Say $0 \\leq i \\lt m$ and $0 \\leq j \\lt n$, and evaluating $C$ takes $O(1)$\n    time. Then the straightforward evaluation of the above recurrence is $O(m n^2)$. There\n    are $m \\times n$ states, and $n$ transitions for each state.\n\n    Let $opt(i, j)$ be the value of $k$ that minimizes the above expression. Assuming that the \n    cost function satisfies the quadrangle inequality, we can show that \n    $opt(i, j) \\leq opt(i, j + 1)$ for all $i, j$. This is known as the _monotonicity condition_. \n    Then, we can apply divide and conquer DP. The optimal\n    \"splitting point\" for a fixed $i$ increases as $j$ increases.\n\n    This lets us solve for all states more efficiently. Say we compute $opt(i, j)$\n    for some fixed $i$ and $j$. Then for any $j' < j$ we know that $opt(i, j') \\leq opt(i, j)$.\n    This means when computing $opt(i, j')$, we don't have to consider as many\n    splitting points!\n\n    To minimize the runtime, we apply the idea behind divide and conquer. First,\n    compute $opt(i, n / 2)$. Then, compute $opt(i, n / 4)$, knowing that it is less\n    than or equal to $opt(i, n / 2)$ and $opt(i, 3 n / 4)$ knowing that it is\n    greater than or equal to $opt(i, n / 2)$. By recursively keeping track of the\n    lower and upper bounds on $opt$, we reach a $O(m n \\log n)$ runtime. Each\n    possible value of $opt(i, j)$ only appears in $\\log n$ different nodes.\n\n    Note that it doesn't matter how \"balanced\" $opt(i, j)$ is. Across a fixed\n    level, each value of $k$ is used at most twice, and there are at most $\\log n$\n    levels.\n\n    ## Generic implementation\n\n    Even though implementation varies based on problem, here's a fairly generic\n    template.\n    The function `compute` computes one row $i$ of states `dp_cur`, given the previous row $i-1$ of states `dp_before`.\n    It has to be called with `compute(0, n-1, 0, n-1)`.

We can smash two rocks together, and the result depends on their weights. If the weights are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If they are different, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the lighter rock's weight. We repeat this process until at most one rock is left. Our task is to find the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock, which could be zero if all rocks are destroyed.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   This problem is similar to a partition problem where we want to split the stones into two groups with the smallest possible difference in their total weights. The idea is to use dynamic programming to find the closest possible sum to half of the total weight of all stones. This is because if we can partition the stones into two groups with equal or nearly equal weights, the difference (or the weight of the last stone) will be minimized.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.\n   2. Initialize a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates if a sum `i` is possible with the given stones.\n   3.

Find the largest possible sum `s1` that is less than or equal to half of the total weight and is achievable.\n   6.

The challenge is akin to a partition problem where we aim to split the stones into two groups with the smallest possible difference in their total weights. This is a classic dynamic programming problem that involves finding the closest possible sum to half of the total weight of all stones.\n\nThe successful strategy involved using a dynamic programming approach to track which sums are possible with the given stones. By iterating over each stone and updating a boolean array (`dp`) that represents achievable sums, we can determine the largest sum `s1` that is less than or equal to half of the total weight. The final result is derived from the formula `total_weight - 2 * s1`, which gives the smallest possible weight of the last stone.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that we explore all possible combinations of stone weights to find the optimal solution. The key takeaway is the use of dynamic programming to solve partition-like problems by tracking achievable sums and leveraging the properties of the problem to minimize the final result."

        "content": "The problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after smashing them together is essentially a partition problem. The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. My initial approach used a dynamic programming array to track possible sums, which is a common technique for partition problems.\n\nThe official solution, however, uses a set to track possible sums, which is a more elegant and concise approach. Here's a breakdown of the official solution:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with a set `dp` containing only the sum `0`. This set will be used to track all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones.\n\n2. **Iterate through stones**: For each stone, update the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in `dp`. This is done using set comprehension, which efficiently updates the set with new possible sums.\n\n3. **Calculate the result**: After processing all stones, the set `dp` contains all possible sums. The goal is to find the sum that, when doubled and subtracted from the total weight, gives the smallest possible result. This is achieved by iterating through the set and calculating the minimum of `abs(total - 2 * _sum)` for each `_sum` in `dp`.\n\nThe official solution is insightful because it leverages Python's set operations to efficiently manage and update possible sums, resulting in a more concise and potentially faster implementation compared to the traditional dynamic programming array approach. This solution is particularly elegant in its use of set comprehension to handle the sum updates in a single line, making the code both compact and easy to understand."

It first computes the total weight of all stones and initializes a boolean array to track possible sums of stone weights. The function then iterates over each stone, updating the array to reflect which sums can be achieved by including each stone. It searches for the largest possible sum that is less than or equal to half of the total weight, which represents the closest balance of two groups of stones. Finally, it returns the difference between the total weight and twice this balanced sum, representing the minimal possible weight of the last stone.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to minimize the remaining weight after a series of pairwise operations that reduce weights, such as in optimization problems involving weights or capacities. It is particularly applicable in problems that can be modeled as a variation of the subset sum problem, where you need to partition a set into two subsets with minimal difference in their sums. This approach can be used in logistics, resource allocation, or any situation where balancing or minimizing the difference between two groups is required."
