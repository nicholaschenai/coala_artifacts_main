    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. We can smash two rocks together, and the result depends on their weights. If the weights are equal, both rocks are destroyed. If they are different, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the lighter rock's weight. We repeat this process until at most one rock is left. Our task is to find the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock, which could be zero if all rocks are destroyed.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   This problem is similar to a partition problem where we want to split the stones into two groups with the smallest possible difference in their total weights. The idea is to use dynamic programming to find the closest possible sum to half of the total weight of all stones. This is because if we can partition the stones into two groups with equal or nearly equal weights, the difference (or the weight of the last stone) will be minimized.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   1. Calculate the total weight of all stones.\n   2. Initialize a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates if a sum `i` is possible with the given stones.\n   3. Set `dp[0]` to True because a sum of 0 is always possible.\n   4. For each stone weight, update the `dp` array from back to front:\n      - For each possible sum from total_weight down to the stone's weight:\n        - If `dp[sum - stone]` is True, set `dp[sum]` to True.\n   5. Find the largest possible sum `s1` that is less than or equal to half of the total weight and is achievable.\n   6. The answer is `total_weight - 2 * s1`.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Calculate the total weight of all stones\n        total_weight = sum(stones)\n        \n        # Initialize a boolean array to track possible sums\n        dp = [False] * (total_weight + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # A sum of 0 is always possible\n        \n        # Update the dp array for each stone\n        for stone in stones:\n            # Update from back to front to avoid overwriting results\n            for weight in range(total_weight, stone - 1, -1):\n                if dp[weight - stone]:\n                    dp[weight] = True\n        \n        # Find the largest possible sum s1 that is <= total_weight // 2\n        s1 = 0\n        for i in range(total_weight // 2, -1, -1):\n            if dp[i]:\n                s1 = i\n                break\n        \n        # The smallest possible weight of the last stone\n        return total_weight - 2 * s1\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the smallest possible weight of the last stone by considering all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones.",
