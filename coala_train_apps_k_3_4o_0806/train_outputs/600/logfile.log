## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of Fibonacci numbers and need to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of their last decimal digits. For each test case, we are given an integer \( N \), which represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to consider. The task is to determine the last remaining number after performing the described process.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

2. **Last Decimal Digit**: For each Fibonacci number, we are interested in its last decimal digit, which is the number modulo 10.

3. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly remove all odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last decimal digits until only one element remains.

4. **Pattern Recognition**: The sequence of last decimal digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a cycle length of 60. This means that the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

5. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the periodicity, for any \( N \), we only need to consider the first 60 Fibonacci numbers to determine the sequence of last digits. We can then simulate the reduction process on this sequence.

6. **Reduction Process**: For a sequence of length \( l \), the new sequence \( E \) is formed by taking every second element starting from the second element. This process is repeated until the sequence has only one element.

## Pseudocode

1. Precompute the last decimal digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. For each test case:
   - Determine the effective length \( N \% 60 \) to use the precomputed sequence.
   - Simulate the reduction process on the sequence of last digits until one element remains.
   - Output the last remaining element.

## Python Solution

```python
def last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(T, test_cases):
    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    
    results = []
    for N in test_cases:
        # Find the effective length using the periodicity of 60
        effective_length = N % 60
        if effective_length == 0:
            effective_length = 60
        
        # Start with the sequence of last digits up to the effective length
        D = last_digits[:effective_length]
        
        # Reduce the sequence until one element remains
        while len(D) > 1:
            D = D[1::2]  # Take every second element starting from the second
        
        # The last remaining element
        results.append(D[0])
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# T = number of test cases
# test_cases = list of N values for each test case
# results = last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(T, test_cases)
# for result in results:
#     print(result)
```

This solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, allowing us to reduce the problem size significantly and perform the reduction process quickly.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer N, and we need to output the N'th number in the series.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
           - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
           - The differences between consecutive terms are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
           - These differences are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

        2. **Formulate the Series**:
           - The N'th term can be expressed as a sum of squares: 
             - \( S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + (N-1)^2 \)
           - This is a known mathematical series where the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers is given by:
             - \( S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \)

        3. **Plan the Solution**:
           - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula for the sum of squares.
           - Output the result for each test case.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_nth_term(N):
            return (N-1) * N * (2*N-1) // 6

        function main():
            read T
            for each test case:
                read N
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                print result
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def calculate_nth_term(N):
            # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **calculate_nth_term**: This function computes the N'th term in the series using the formula for the sum of squares.
        - **main**: This function handles input and output. It reads all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints, and processes each test case to compute and print the result.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum of a subsequence of PokÃ©mon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.

    #### Strategies and Mistakes
    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.

    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.

    ### Code Snippet

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            n, strengths = test_case
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
            alternating_sum = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]
                else:
                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]
            results.append(alternating_sum)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
            test_cases.append((n, strengths))
    
        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The current solution checks if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices. However, this approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that each element can be reduced by a multiple of its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted in a more flexible manner than just checking divisibility.

        ### Where the Solution Went Wrong

        1. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The solution assumed that the sum of the sequence needs to be divisible by the sum of indices, which is not a correct interpretation of the operations allowed. The operations allow for more flexibility in adjusting the sequence.

        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic of checking divisibility does not correctly capture the ability to adjust each element by its index, which can lead to a variety of possible sums, not just those divisible by the sum of indices.

        ### Correct Approach

        1. **Cumulative Adjustment**: We need to consider the cumulative effect of adjusting each element by its index. This means we should simulate the process of adjusting the sequence to see if we can reach a sum of zero.

        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

        ### Revised Solution

        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:

        - Start with the sum of the sequence.
        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.
        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return "NO".
        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return "YES".

        ### Revised Pseudocode

        function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N = test_case[0]
                A = test_case[1]
        
                sum_A = sum(A)
                required_sum = 0
        
                for i from 1 to N:
                    required_sum += i
                    if sum_A < required_sum:

        ### Explanation of the Revised Code

        - **Iterative Adjustment**: The code iteratively checks if the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero by simulating the process of reducing each element by its index.
        - **Feasibility Check**: If at any point the sum of the sequence cannot be adjusted to meet the required sum, it returns "NO".
        - **Final Check**: If the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, it returns "YES".
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's correct the solution by properly simulating the process of adjusting the sequence to make it sum to zero. The key is to ensure that we can adjust each element by its index in a way that allows the total sum to reach zero.

        Here's the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                N = test_case[0]
                A = test_case[1]
        
                sum_A = sum(A)
                required_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
                # We need to check if we can make the sum of A equal to zero
                # by reducing it by multiples of the sum of indices (1 to N)
                if sum_A % required_sum == 0:
                    # Calculate how many times we need to perform the operation
                    k = sum_A // required_sum
                    # Check if we can distribute k operations across the sequence
                    possible = True
                    for i in range(N):
                        # Calculate the required change for A[i]
                        change = A[i] - (k * (i + 1))
                        if change < 0:
                            possible = False
                            break
            
                    if possible:
                        results.append("YES")
                    else:
                        results.append("NO")
                else:
                    results.append("NO")
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code

        - **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices (1 to N).
        - **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices. If not, it's impossible to make the sequence sum to zero.
        - **Operation Count**: If divisible, calculate how many times we need to perform the operation (`k`).
        - **Feasibility Check**: For each element, check if it can be adjusted by `k` operations without going negative. If any element cannot be adjusted properly, it's impossible to make the sequence sum to zero.
        - **Output**: Append "YES" or "NO" to the results based on the feasibility check and print the results.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the last remaining number in a sequence derived from the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The sequence is repeatedly halved by removing all odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Last Digits**:
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
   - We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).

2. **Sequence Reduction**:
   - Start with the sequence \( D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10) \).
   - Repeatedly create a new sequence \( E \) by taking every second element from \( D \) (i.e., \( D_2, D_4, \ldots \)) until only one element remains.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Directly calculating Fibonacci numbers up to \( N \) is infeasible for large \( N \) due to time complexity.
   - The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This means the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

4. **Solution Strategy**:
   - For each test case, determine the position in the periodic sequence using \( N \% 60 \).
   - Simulate the sequence reduction process using the periodic sequence to find the last remaining number.

    if n == 0:
        return 0

        a, b = 0, 1
        for i from 2 to n:
            a, b = b, (a + b) % 10
        return b

function find_last_remaining_number(N):
    # Find the position in the periodic sequence
    position = (N - 1) % 60
    # Get the last digit of the Fibonacci number at this position
    last_digit = last_digit_of_fibonacci(position)
    # Simulate the sequence reduction

    read T

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (20 points):
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^7$

-----Example Output-----
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the last remaining number in a sequence derived from the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The sequence is repeatedly halved by removing all odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Last Digits**:
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
   - We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).

2. **Sequence Reduction**:
   - Start with the sequence \( D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10) \).
   - Repeatedly create a new sequence \( E \) by taking every second element from \( D \) (i.e., \( D_2, D_4, \ldots \)) until only one element remains.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Directly calculating Fibonacci numbers up to \( N \) is infeasible for large \( N \) due to time complexity.
   - The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This means the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

4. **Solution Strategy**:
   - For each test case, determine the position in the periodic sequence using \( N \% 60 \).
   - Simulate the sequence reduction process using the periodic sequence to find the last remaining number.

### Pseudocode

```
function last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

        a, b = 0, 1
        for i from 2 to n:
            a, b = b, (a + b) % 10
        return b

    # Find the position in the periodic sequence
    position = (N - 1) % 60
    # Get the last digit of the Fibonacci number at this position
    last_digit = last_digit_of_fibonacci(position)
    # Simulate the sequence reduction

        position = position // 2

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
2. **Last Digit Sequence**: We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).
3. **Periodic Nature**: The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60.
4. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly create a new sequence by taking every second element from the current sequence until only one element remains.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodic Sequence**: The solution correctly identifies the periodic nature of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Reduction Process**: The solution attempts to simulate the reduction process by halving the position index, but it seems to be incorrect in how it determines the last remaining number.

### Mistake Identification

- The mistake lies in the reduction process. The code attempts to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, but it does not correctly simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements.
- The function `find_last_remaining_number` should correctly simulate the sequence reduction by iteratively removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last digits.

### Correct Approach

1. **Generate the Periodic Sequence**: Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Simulate the Reduction**: Use the periodic sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i from 2 to 59:
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

function find_last_remaining_number(N):
    last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()
    position = (N - 1) % 60
    while position > 0:
        position = position // 2
    return last_digits[position]

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
        print result
```

### Revised Python Solution

```python
def generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def find_last_remaining_number(N):
    last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()
    position = (N - 1) % 60
    while position > 0:
        position = position // 2
    return last_digits[position]

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read

### Explanation

1. **Generate the Periodic Sequence**: Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Simulate the Reduction**: Use the periodic sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i from 2 to 59:
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

function find_last_remaining_number(N):
    last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()
    position = (N - 1) % 60
    while position > 0:
        position = position // 2
    return last_digits[position]

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
        print result
```

### Revised Python Solution

```python
def generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def find_last_remaining_number(N):
    last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()
    position = (N - 1) % 60
    while position > 0:
        position = position // 2
    return last_digits[position]

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer N, and we need to output the N'th number in the series.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
           - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
           - The differences between consecutive terms are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
           - These differences are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

        2. **Formulate the Series**:
           - The N'th term can be expressed as a sum of squares: 
             - \( S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + (N-1)^2 \)
           - This is a known mathematical series where the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers is given by:
             - \( S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \)

        3. **Plan the Solution**:
           - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula for the sum of squares.
           - Output the result for each test case.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_nth_term(N):
            return (N-1) * N * (2*N-1) // 6

        function main():
            read T
            for each test case:
                read N
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                print result
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def calculate_nth_term(N):
            # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

        def main():
            import sys

                print(result)

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    **Initial Strategy:**
    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \( N \).

    **Correct Strategy:**
    The correct formula is:
    \[ \text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \]
    This formula:
    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.
    - Uses \( 3^{(N-2)} \) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.
    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.

    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution aim to find the N'th term in a series defined by a specific pattern. The series is generated by summing the squares of integers starting from 1. My approach used a direct mathematical formula for the sum of squares, which is efficient and straightforward.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Mathematical Formula**: Both solutions rely on the mathematical formula for the sum of squares, which is a well-known formula: \( S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \). This formula allows us to compute the N'th term in constant time, \( O(1) \).

    2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes a specific check for when \( N = 1 \), directly returning 0. This is a simple but important step to handle the base case of the series.

    3. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient in terms of time complexity, as they compute the result in constant time for each test case. This is crucial given the constraints, where \( T \) and \( N \) can be as large as 10,000.

    4. **Differences in Implementation**: The official solution uses a slightly different approach by adjusting \( N \) before applying the formula. It subtracts 2 from \( N \) and then applies a modified version of the formula. This approach works because it effectively shifts the series to start from the second term, aligning with the series' pattern.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively leverage the mathematical properties of the series to compute the desired terms efficiently. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding and applying mathematical formulas to solve problems involving series or sequences.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the last remaining number in a sequence derived from the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The sequence is repeatedly halved by removing all odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Last Digits**:
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
   - We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).

2. **Sequence Reduction**:
   - Start with the sequence \( D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10) \).
   - Repeatedly create a new sequence \( E \) by taking every second element from \( D \) (i.e., \( D_2, D_4, \ldots \)) until only one element remains.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Directly calculating Fibonacci numbers up to \( N \) is infeasible for large \( N \) due to time complexity.
   - The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This means the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

4. **Solution Strategy**:
   - For each test case, determine the position in the periodic sequence using \( N \% 60 \).
   - Simulate the sequence reduction process using the periodic sequence to find the last remaining number.

### Pseudocode

        a, b = 0, 1
        for i from 2 to n:
            a, b = b, (a + b) % 10
        return b

function find_last_remaining_number(N):
    # Find the position in the periodic sequence

    # Simulate the sequence reduction

    return last_digit

    read T
    for each test case:

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
2. **Last Digit Sequence**: We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).
3. **Periodic Nature**: The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60.
4. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly create a new sequence by taking every second element from the current sequence until only one element remains.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodic Sequence**: The solution correctly identifies the periodic nature of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Reduction Process**: The solution attempts to simulate the reduction process by halving the position index, but it seems to be incorrect in how it determines the last remaining number.

### Mistake Identification

- The mistake lies in the reduction process. The code attempts to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, but it does not correctly simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements.
- The function `find_last_remaining_number` should correctly simulate the sequence reduction by iteratively removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last digits.

### Correct Approach

1. **Generate the Periodic Sequence**: Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Simulate the Reduction**: Use the periodic sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (20 points):

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the last remaining number in a sequence derived from the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The sequence is repeatedly halved by removing all odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Last Digits**:
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
   - We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).

2. **Sequence Reduction**:
   - Start with the sequence \( D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10) \).
   - Repeatedly create a new sequence \( E \) by taking every second element from \( D \) (i.e., \( D_2, D_4, \ldots \)) until only one element remains.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Directly calculating Fibonacci numbers up to \( N \) is infeasible for large \( N \) due to time complexity.
   - The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This means the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

4. **Solution Strategy**:
   - For each test case, determine the position in the periodic sequence using \( N \% 60 \).
   - Simulate the sequence reduction process using the periodic sequence to find the last remaining number.

### Pseudocode

```
function last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i from 2 to n:
            a, b = b, (a + b) % 10
        return b

function find_last_remaining_number(N):
    # Find the position in the periodic sequence
    position = (N - 1) % 60
    # Get the last digit of the Fibonacci number at this position
    last_digit = last_digit_of_fibonacci(position)
    # Simulate the sequence reduction
    while position > 0:
        position = position // 2
        last_digit = last_digit_of_fibonacci(position)
    return last_digit

    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = find_last_remaining_number(N)

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
2. **Last Digit Sequence**: We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).
3. **Periodic Nature**: The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60.
4. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly create a new sequence by taking every second element from the current sequence until only one element remains.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodic Sequence**: The solution correctly identifies the periodic nature of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Reduction Process**: The solution attempts to simulate the reduction process by halving the position index, but it seems to be incorrect in how it determines the last remaining number.

### Mistake Identification

- The mistake lies in the reduction process. The code attempts to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, but it does not correctly simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements.
- The function `find_last_remaining_number` should correctly simulate the sequence reduction by iteratively removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last digits.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] Let's carefully analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
2. **Last Digit Sequence**: We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).
3. **Periodic Nature**: The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60.
4. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly create a new sequence by taking every second element from the current sequence until only one element remains.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodic Sequence**: The solution correctly identifies the periodic nature of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Reduction Process**: The solution attempts to simulate the reduction process by halving the position index, but it seems to be incorrect in how it determines the last remaining number.

### Mistake Identification

- The mistake lies in the reduction process. The code attempts to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, but it does not correctly simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements.
- The function `find_last_remaining_number` should correctly simulate the sequence reduction by iteratively removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last digits.

### Correct Approach

1. **Generate the Periodic Sequence**: Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Simulate the Reduction**: Use the periodic sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer N, and we need to output the N'th number in the series.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
           - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
           - The differences between consecutive terms are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
           - These differences are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

        2. **Formulate the Series**:
           - The N'th term can be expressed as a sum of squares: 
             - \( S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + (N-1)^2 \)
           - This is a known mathematical series where the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers is given by:
             - \( S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \)

        3. **Plan the Solution**:
           - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula for the sum of squares.
           - Output the result for each test case.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_nth_term(N):
            return (N-1) * N * (2*N-1) // 6

        function main():
            read T
            for each test case:
                read N
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                print result
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def calculate_nth_term(N):
            # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                results.append(result)

                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    **Initial Strategy:**
    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \( N \).

    **Correct Strategy:**
    The correct formula is:
    \[ \text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \]
    This formula:
    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.
    - Uses \( 3^{(N-2)} \) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.
    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.

    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution aim to find the N'th term in a series defined by a specific pattern. The series is generated by summing the squares of integers starting from 1. My approach used a direct mathematical formula for the sum of squares, which is efficient and straightforward.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Mathematical Formula**: Both solutions rely on the mathematical formula for the sum of squares, which is a well-known formula: \( S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \). This formula allows us to compute the N'th term in constant time, \( O(1) \).

    2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes a specific check for when \( N = 1 \), directly returning 0. This is a simple but important step to handle the base case of the series.

    3. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient in terms of time complexity, as they compute the result in constant time for each test case. This is crucial given the constraints, where \( T \) and \( N \) can be as large as 10,000.

    4. **Differences in Implementation**: The official solution uses a slightly different approach by adjusting \( N \) before applying the formula. It subtracts 2 from \( N \) and then applies a modified version of the formula. This approach works because it effectively shifts the series to start from the second term, aligning with the series' pattern.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively leverage the mathematical properties of the series to compute the desired terms efficiently. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding and applying mathematical formulas to solve problems involving series or sequences.

Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (20 points):
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^7$
Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
1
9

-----Example Output-----
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the last remaining number in a sequence derived from the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The sequence is repeatedly halved by removing all odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Last Digits**:
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
   - We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).

2. **Sequence Reduction**:
   - Start with the sequence \( D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10) \).
   - Repeatedly create a new sequence \( E \) by taking every second element from \( D \) (i.e., \( D_2, D_4, \ldots \)) until only one element remains.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Directly calculating Fibonacci numbers up to \( N \) is infeasible for large \( N \) due to time complexity.
   - The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This means the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

4. **Solution Strategy**:
   - For each test case, determine the position in the periodic sequence using \( N \% 60 \).
   - Simulate the sequence reduction process using the periodic sequence to find the last remaining number.

### Pseudocode

```
function last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i from 2 to n:
            a, b = b, (a + b) % 10
        return b

function find_last_remaining_number(N):
    # Find the position in the periodic sequence
    position = (N - 1) % 60
    # Get the last digit of the Fibonacci number at this position
    last_digit = last_digit_of_fibonacci(position)
    # Simulate the sequence reduction
    while position > 0:
        position = position // 2
        last_digit = last_digit_of_fibonacci(position)
    return last_digit

    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
        print result
```

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
2. **Last Digit Sequence**: We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).
3. **Periodic Nature**: The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60.
4. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly create a new sequence by taking every second element from the current sequence until only one element remains.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodic Sequence**: The solution correctly identifies the periodic nature of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Reduction Process**: The solution attempts to simulate the reduction process by halving the position index, but it seems to be incorrect in how it determines the last remaining number.

### Mistake Identification

- The mistake lies in the reduction process. The code attempts to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, but it does not correctly simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements.
- The function `find_last_remaining_number` should correctly simulate the sequence reduction by iteratively removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last digits.

### Correct Approach

1. **Generate the Periodic Sequence**: Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Simulate the Reduction**: Use the periodic sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i from 2 to 59:
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (20 points):
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^7$
Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
1
9

-----Example Output-----
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the last remaining number in a sequence derived from the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The sequence is repeatedly halved by removing all odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Last Digits**:
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
   - We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).

2. **Sequence Reduction**:
   - Start with the sequence \( D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10) \).
   - Repeatedly create a new sequence \( E \) by taking every second element from \( D \) (i.e., \( D_2, D_4, \ldots \)) until only one element remains.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Directly calculating Fibonacci numbers up to \( N \) is infeasible for large \( N \) due to time complexity.
   - The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This means the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

4. **Solution Strategy**:
   - For each test case, determine the position in the periodic sequence using \( N \% 60 \).
   - Simulate the sequence reduction process using the periodic sequence to find the last remaining number.

### Pseudocode

```
function last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i from 2 to n:
            a, b = b, (a + b) % 10
        return b

function find_last_remaining_number(N):
    # Find the position in the periodic sequence
    position = (N - 1) % 60
    # Get the last digit of the Fibonacci number at this position
    last_digit = last_digit_of_fibonacci(position)
    # Simulate the sequence reduction
    while position > 0:
        position = position // 2
        last_digit = last_digit_of_fibonacci(position)
    return last_digit

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
        print result
```

### Final Python Solution

def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
2. **Last Digit Sequence**: We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).
3. **Periodic Nature**: The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60.
4. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly create a new sequence by taking every second element from the current sequence until only one element remains.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodic Sequence**: The solution correctly identifies the periodic nature of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Reduction Process**: The solution attempts to simulate the reduction process by halving the position index, but it seems to be incorrect in how it determines the last remaining number.

### Mistake Identification

- The mistake lies in the reduction process. The code attempts to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, but it does not correctly simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements.
- The function `find_last_remaining_number` should correctly simulate the sequence reduction by iteratively removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last digits.

### Correct Approach

1. **Generate the Periodic Sequence**: Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Simulate the Reduction**: Use the periodic sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i from 2 to 59:
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)

    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
        print result
```

### Explanation

- **generate_fibonacci_last_digits**: Precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
- **find_last_remaining_number**: Uses the precomputed sequence to simulate the reduction process by halving the position index until it reaches zero.
- **main**: Handles input and output efficiently, especially given the constraints, by reading all input at once and processing each test case. 

This solution should now correctly simulate the sequence reduction process and provide the correct last remaining number for each test case.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer N, and we need to output the N'th number in the series.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
           - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
           - The differences between consecutive terms are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
           - These differences are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

        2. **Formulate the Series**:
           - The N'th term can be expressed as a sum of squares: 
             - \( S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + (N-1)^2 \)
           - This is a known mathematical series where the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers is given by:
             - \( S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \)

        3. **Plan the Solution**:
           - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula for the sum of squares.
           - Output the result for each test case.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_nth_term(N):
            return (N-1) * N * (2*N-1) // 6

        function main():
            read T
            for each test case:
                read N
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                print result
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def calculate_nth_term(N):
            # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

        def main():
            import sys

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    **Initial Strategy:**
    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \( N \).

    **Correct Strategy:**
    The correct formula is:
    \[ \text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \]
    This formula:
    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.
    - Uses \( 3^{(N-2)} \) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.
    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.

    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution aim to find the N'th term in a series defined by a specific pattern. The series is generated by summing the squares of integers starting from 1. My approach used a direct mathematical formula for the sum of squares, which is efficient and straightforward.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Mathematical Formula**: Both solutions rely on the mathematical formula for the sum of squares, which is a well-known formula: \( S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \). This formula allows us to compute the N'th term in constant time, \( O(1) \).

    2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes a specific check for when \( N = 1 \), directly returning 0. This is a simple but important step to handle the base case of the series.

    3. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient in terms of time complexity, as they compute the result in constant time for each test case. This is crucial given the constraints, where \( T \) and \( N \) can be as large as 10,000.

    4. **Differences in Implementation**: The official solution uses a slightly different approach by adjusting \( N \) before applying the formula. It subtracts 2 from \( N \) and then applies a modified version of the formula. This approach works because it effectively shifts the series to start from the second term, aligning with the series' pattern.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively leverage the mathematical properties of the series to compute the desired terms efficiently. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding and applying mathematical formulas to solve problems involving series or sequences.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the last remaining number in a sequence derived from the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The sequence is repeatedly halved by removing all odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Last Digits**:
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
   - We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).

2. **Sequence Reduction**:
   - Start with the sequence \( D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10) \).
   - Repeatedly create a new sequence \( E \) by taking every second element from \( D \) (i.e., \( D_2, D_4, \ldots \)) until only one element remains.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Directly calculating Fibonacci numbers up to \( N \) is infeasible for large \( N \) due to time complexity.
   - The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This means the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

4. **Solution Strategy**:
   - For each test case, determine the position in the periodic sequence using \( N \% 60 \).
   - Simulate the sequence reduction process using the periodic sequence to find the last remaining number.

### Pseudocode

    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
2. **Last Digit Sequence**: We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).
3. **Periodic Nature**: The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60.
4. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly create a new sequence by taking every second element from the current sequence until only one element remains.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodic Sequence**: The solution correctly identifies the periodic nature of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Reduction Process**: The solution attempts to simulate the reduction process by halving the position index, but it seems to be incorrect in how it determines the last remaining number.

### Mistake Identification

- The mistake lies in the reduction process. The code attempts to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, but it does not correctly simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements.
- The function `find_last_remaining_number` should correctly simulate the sequence reduction by iteratively removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last digits.

### Correct Approach

1. **Generate the Periodic Sequence**: Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Simulate the Reduction**: Use the periodic sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts on the Fibonacci Last Digit Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem revolves around the Fibonacci sequence and its properties, specifically focusing on the last digit of Fibonacci numbers. A key insight is that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This periodicity allows us to reduce the problem's complexity significantly, especially given the constraints where \( N \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \).

#### Strategies and Errors
Initially, the approach was to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, which was incorrect. The mistake was in misunderstanding how the sequence reduction should be simulated. The correct approach involves using the periodic sequence of last digits and simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

#### Correct Approach
1. **Precompute the Periodic Sequence**: Calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Simulate Sequence Reduction**: Use the precomputed sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

#### Code Snippet
```python
def generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 60):
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    return last_digits

def find_last_remaining_number(N):
    last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()
    position = (N - 1) % 60
    while position > 0:
        position = position // 2
    return last_digits[position]

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Lessons Learned
The key takeaway is the importance of understanding the periodic nature of sequences and how it can be leveraged to simplify complex problems. Additionally, correctly simulating processes that involve iterative reductions is crucial for solving such problems accurately.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the last remaining number in a sequence derived from the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The sequence is repeatedly halved by removing all odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Fibonacci Sequence and Last Digits**:
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
   - We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).

2. **Sequence Reduction**:
   - Start with the sequence \( D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10) \).
   - Repeatedly create a new sequence \( E \) by taking every second element from \( D \) (i.e., \( D_2, D_4, \ldots \)) until only one element remains.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Directly calculating Fibonacci numbers up to \( N \) is infeasible for large \( N \) due to time complexity.
   - The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This means the sequence of last digits repeats every 60 numbers.

4. **Solution Strategy**:
   - For each test case, determine the position in the periodic sequence using \( N \% 60 \).
   - Simulate the sequence reduction process using the periodic sequence to find the last remaining number.

### Pseudocode

```
function last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i from 2 to n:
            a, b = b, (a + b) % 10
        return b

function find_last_remaining_number(N):
    # Find the position in the periodic sequence
    position = (N - 1) % 60
    # Get the last digit of the Fibonacci number at this position
    last_digit = last_digit_of_fibonacci(position)
    # Simulate the sequence reduction
    while position > 0:
        position = position // 2
        last_digit = last_digit_of_fibonacci(position)
    return last_digit

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
        print result
```

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).
2. **Last Digit Sequence**: We are interested in the last digit of each Fibonacci number, which can be obtained using \( F_n \% 10 \).
3. **Periodic Nature**: The sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60.
4. **Sequence Reduction**: We repeatedly create a new sequence by taking every second element from the current sequence until only one element remains.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Periodic Sequence**: The solution correctly identifies the periodic nature of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Reduction Process**: The solution attempts to simulate the reduction process by halving the position index, but it seems to be incorrect in how it determines the last remaining number.

### Mistake Identification

- The mistake lies in the reduction process. The code attempts to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, but it does not correctly simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements.
- The function `find_last_remaining_number` should correctly simulate the sequence reduction by iteratively removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence of last digits.

### Correct Approach

1. **Generate the Periodic Sequence**: Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Simulate the Reduction**: Use the periodic sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
    last_digits = [0, 1]
    for i from 2 to 59:
        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] Reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I realize that the key issue was in the simulation of the sequence reduction process. My approach incorrectly attempted to simulate the reduction by halving the position index, which did not accurately reflect the process of removing odd-indexed elements.

The official solution provides a more insightful approach by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers. Here's a breakdown of the official solution:

1. **Precomputation of Last Digits**: The solution precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers, recognizing the periodicity of the sequence. This is similar to my approach, but the official solution uses a slightly different initialization.

2. **Binary Representation Insight**: The official solution uses the binary representation of \( N \) to determine the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( N \). This is a clever way to simulate the sequence reduction process, as each step of removing odd-indexed elements effectively corresponds to halving the sequence length, which is akin to finding the largest power of 2.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The solution then uses the modulo operation with 60 to find the correct position in the precomputed sequence of last digits. This ensures that the solution is efficient and works within the constraints.

The official solution is insightful because it effectively combines the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence's last digits with properties of binary numbers to efficiently solve the problem. This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it well-suited for the problem's constraints.
