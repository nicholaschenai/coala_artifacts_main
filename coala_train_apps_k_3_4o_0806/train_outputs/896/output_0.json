    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nChef has a sequence of segments, and he wants to transform the first segment into the last one by performing a series of operations. Each operation allows shifting one of the segment's borders by one unit, either increasing or decreasing the left or right border. The goal is to find the minimal number of operations required to transform the first segment into the last one, and if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, choose the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Operations**: For a segment [L, R], the operations allowed are:\n   - L+ (increase L by 1)\n   - L- (decrease L by 1)\n   - R+ (increase R by 1)\n   - R- (decrease R by 1)\n\n2. **Transformation Process**: We need to transform the first segment into the second, then the second into the third, and so on, until the last segment.\n\n3. **Optimal Strategy**:\n   - For each transformation from segment [Li, Ri] to [Li+1, Ri+1], calculate the difference in the left and right borders.\n   - Use the minimal number of operations to adjust the borders.\n   - Choose operations in lexicographical order when possible.\n\n4. **Lexicographical Order**: The order of operations is L+, L-, R+, R-. This means if two sequences have the same number of operations, the one with more L+ operations is considered smaller.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction transform_segments(T, test_cases):\n    for each test case:\n        read N and segments\n        initialize total_operations as 0\n        initialize operations_sequence as empty string\n        \n        for i from 1 to N-1:\n            calculate delta_L = L[i+1] - L[i]\n            calculate delta_R = R[i+1] - R[i]\n            \n            if delta_L > 0:\n                append \"L+\" * delta_L to operations_sequence\n            else:\n                append \"L-\" * abs(delta_L) to operations_sequence\n            \n            if delta_R > 0:\n                append \"R+\" * delta_R to operations_sequence\n            else:\n                append \"R-\" * abs(delta_R) to operations_sequence\n            \n            update total_operations with the sum of absolute values of delta_L and delta_R\n        \n        print total_operations\n        print operations_sequence\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef transform_segments():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        segments = []\n        \n        for _ in range(N):\n            L = int(data[index])\n            R = int(data[index + 1])\n            segments.append((L, R))\n            index += 2\n        \n        total_operations = 0\n        operations_sequence = []\n        \n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            L1, R1 = segments[i]\n            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]\n            \n            delta_L = L2 - L1\n            delta_R = R2 - R1\n            \n            if delta_L > 0:\n                operations_sequence.append(\"L+\" * delta_L)\n            else:\n                operations_sequence.append(\"L-\" * (-delta_L))\n            \n            if delta_R > 0:\n                operations_sequence.append(\"R+\" * delta_R)\n            else:\n                operations_sequence.append(\"R-\" * (-delta_R))\n            \n            total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)\n        \n        results.append(f\"{total_operations}\")\n        results.append(\"\".join(operations_sequence))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes each test case by calculating the required operations to transform each segment into the next, and outputs the total number of operations and the sequence of operations for each test case.",
