There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 102\n- 1 \u2264 K,Ai \u2264 109\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2 \n4 9\n5 2 2 4\n4 9\n5 2 18 3\n\nOutput:\nYES\nNO\n\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.\nExample case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe have a number of test cases. For each test case, we are given:\n- `N`: the number of minions.\n- `K`: the total amount of money Gru has.\n- A list of `N` integers, each representing the amount of money a minion demands.\n\nThe task is to determine if Gru can distribute all his money (`K`) among the minions such that he has no money left. Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount is less than or equal to the money he has left at that point.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. For each test case, we need to check if there is a combination of the minions' demands that sums exactly to `K`.\n2. This is a classic subset sum problem where we need to determine if a subset of the given demands can sum up to `K`.\n3. We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently:\n   - Use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a sum of `j` can be achieved with the given demands.\n   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `True` because a sum of zero can always be achieved with an empty subset.\n   - For each demand, update the `dp` array from back to front to avoid using the same demand multiple times.\n   - After processing all demands, check if `dp[K]` is `True`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction canSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, demands = test_case\n        dp = array of size (K+1) initialized to False\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        for each demand in demands:\n            for j from K down to demand:\n                if dp[j - demand] is True:\n                    dp[j] = True\n        \n        if dp[K] is True:\n            print \"YES\"\n        else:\n            print \"NO\"\n```\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef canSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, demands = test_case\n        # Initialize a dp array of size K+1 with False\n        dp = [False] * (K + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # Base case: sum of 0 is always possible\n        \n        # Process each demand\n        for demand in demands:\n            # Update dp array from back to front\n            for j in range(K, demand - 1, -1):\n                if dp[j - demand]:\n                    dp[j] = True\n        \n        # Check if we can achieve the sum K\n        if dp[K]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    K = int(data[index + 1])\n    demands = list(map(int, data[index + 2:index + 2 + N]))\n    test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n    index += 2 + N\n\n# Call the function\ncanSpendAllMoney(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case using a dynamic programming approach to solve the subset sum problem, and prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on whether Gru can spend all his money."

This assumption is flawed because it doesn't account for the individual adjustments needed for each element.\n\n        ### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n        1. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The solution assumes that divisibility by the sum of indices is sufficient to determine if the sequence can be made to sum to zero. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the specific adjustments needed for each element.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Feasibility Check**: The check for whether each element can be adjusted by `k` operations is not correctly implemented. The logic should ensure that the cumulative adjustments can lead to a zero sum, not just individual feasibility.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        1. **Cumulative Adjustment Simulation**: We need to simulate the process of adjusting each element by its index and ensure that the cumulative effect can lead to a zero sum.\n\n        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:\n\n        - Start with the sum of the sequence.\n        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.\n        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return \"NO\".\n        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return \"YES\".\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                # We need to check if we can make the sum of A equal to zero\n                # by reducing it by multiples of the sum of indices (1 to N)\n                if sum_A % required_sum == 0:\n                    # Calculate how many times we need to perform the operation\n                    k = sum_A // required_sum\n                    # Check if we can distribute k operations across the sequence\n                    possible = True\n                    for i in range(N):\n                        # Calculate the required change for A[i]\n                        change = A[i] - (k * (i + 1))\n                        if change < 0:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n            \n                    if possible:\n                        results.append(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code\n\n        - **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices (1 to N).\n        - **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices. If not, it's impossible to make the sequence sum to zero.\n        - **Operation Count**: If divisible, calculate how many times we need to perform the operation (`k`).\n        - **Feasibility Check**: For each element, check if it can be adjusted by `k` operations without going negative. If any element cannot be adjusted properly, it's impossible to make the sequence sum to zero.\n        - **Output**: Append \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the results based on the feasibility check and print the results.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's address the problem with a fresh approach. The key is to simulate the process of adjusting the sequence to make the sum zero by using the allowed operations effectively.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.\n\n        2. **Key Insight**: The sum of the sequence can be adjusted by reducing each element by its index. The problem boils down to checking if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by these operations.\n\n        3. **Solution Strategy**:\n           - Calculate the sum of the sequence.\n           - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.\n           - Check if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by iteratively applying the operations.\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                # We need to check if we can make the sum of A equal to zero\n                # by reducing it by multiples of the sum of indices (1 to N)\n                if sum_A % required_sum == 0:\n                    # Calculate how many times we need to perform the operation\n                    k = sum_A // required_sum\n                    # Check if we can distribute k operations across the sequence\n                    possible = True\n                    for i in range(N):\n                        # Calculate the required change for A[i]\n                        change = A[i] - (k * (i + 1))\n                        if change < 0:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n            \n                    if possible:\n                        results.append(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code\n\n        - **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices (1 to N).\n        - **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices.

The logic should ensure that the cumulative adjustments can lead to a zero sum, not just individual feasibility.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        1. **Cumulative Adjustment Simulation**: We need to simulate the process of adjusting each element by its index and ensure that the cumulative effect can lead to a zero sum.\n\n        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:\n\n        - Start with the sum of the sequence.\n        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.\n        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return \"NO\".\n        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return \"YES\".\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                # We need to check if we can make the sum of A equal to zero\n                # by reducing it by multiples of the sum of indices (1 to N)\n                if sum_A % required_sum == 0:\n                    # Calculate how many times we need to perform the operation\n                    k = sum_A // required_sum\n                    # Check if we can distribute k operations across the sequence\n                    possible = True\n                    for i in range(N):\n                        # Calculate the required change for A[i]\n                        change = A[i] - (k * (i + 1))\n                        if change < 0:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n            \n                    if possible:\n                        results.append(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code\n\n        - **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices (1 to N).\n        - **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices.

This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.\n\n        2. **Key Insight**: The sum of the sequence can be adjusted by reducing each element by its index.

If the sum of the demands equals the money Gru has, then Gru can distribute all his money, and we should output \"YES\". Otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           N, K = test_case[0]  # Number of minions and money Gru has\n           demands = test_case[1]  # List of money demands by minions\n           \n           if sum(demands) == K:\n               print \"YES\"\n           else:\n               print \"NO\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        # Unpack the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has\n        N, K = test_case[0]\n        # Unpack the list of demands\n        demands = test_case[1]\n        \n        # Calculate the total demand\n        total_demand = sum(demands)\n        \n        # Check if the total demand is equal to the money Gru has\n        if total_demand == K:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n        index += 2\n        demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n    \n    can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case to determine if Gru can distribute all his money, and outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly."

This assumption is flawed because it doesn't account for the individual adjustments needed for each element.\n\n        ### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n        1. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The solution assumes that divisibility by the sum of indices is sufficient to determine if the sequence can be made to sum to zero. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the specific adjustments needed for each element.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Feasibility Check**: The check for whether each element can be adjusted by `k` operations is not correctly implemented. The logic should ensure that the cumulative adjustments can lead to a zero sum, not just individual feasibility.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        1. **Cumulative Adjustment Simulation**: We need to simulate the process of adjusting each element by its index and ensure that the cumulative effect can lead to a zero sum.\n\n        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:\n\n        - Start with the sum of the sequence.\n        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.\n        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return \"NO\".\n        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return \"YES\".\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                # We need to check if we can make the sum of A equal to zero\n                # by reducing it by multiples of the sum of indices (1 to N)\n                if sum_A % required_sum == 0:\n                    # Calculate how many times we need to perform the operation\n                    k = sum_A // required_sum\n                    # Check if we can distribute k operations across the sequence\n                    possible = True\n                    for i in range(N):\n                        # Calculate the required change for A[i]\n                        change = A[i] - (k * (i + 1))\n                        if change < 0:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n            \n                    if possible:\n                        results.append(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code\n\n        - **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices (1 to N).\n        - **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices.

This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.\n\n        2. **Key Insight**: The sum of the sequence can be adjusted by reducing each element by its index.

This means we should simulate the process of adjusting the sequence to see if we can reach a sum of zero.\n\n        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:\n\n        - Start with the sum of the sequence.\n        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.\n        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return \"NO\".\n        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return \"YES\".\n\n        ### Revised Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = 0\n        \n                for i from 1 to N:\n                    required_sum += i\n                    if sum_A < required_sum:\n                        print \"NO\"\n                        break\n                    sum_A -= required_sum\n        \n                if sum_A == 0:\n                    print \"YES\"\n        ```\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = 0\n                possible = True\n        \n                for i in range(1, N + 1):\n                    required_sum += i\n                    if sum_A < required_sum:\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                    sum_A -= i\n        \n                if possible and sum_A == 0:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Revised Code\n\n        - **Iterative Adjustment**: The code iteratively checks if the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero by simulating the process of reducing each element by its index.\n        - **Feasibility Check**: If at any point the sum of the sequence cannot be adjusted to meet the required sum, it returns \"NO\".\n        - **Final Check**: If the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, it returns \"YES\".\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's correct the solution by properly simulating the process of adjusting the sequence to make it sum to zero.

We then parse the number of test cases and for each test case, we parse the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n- **Logic**: For each test case, we calculate the total demand by summing the list of demands. We then check if this total demand is equal to the amount of money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money, and we append \"YES\" to the results. Otherwise, we append \"NO\".\n- **Output**: Finally, we print the results for each test case."

This assumption is flawed because it doesn't account for the individual adjustments needed for each element.\n\n        ### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n        1. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The solution assumes that divisibility by the sum of indices is sufficient to determine if the sequence can be made to sum to zero. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the specific adjustments needed for each element.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Feasibility Check**: The check for whether each element can be adjusted by `k` operations is not correctly implemented. The logic should ensure that the cumulative adjustments can lead to a zero sum, not just individual feasibility.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        1. **Cumulative Adjustment Simulation**: We need to simulate the process of adjusting each element by its index and ensure that the cumulative effect can lead to a zero sum.\n\n        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:\n\n        - Start with the sum of the sequence.\n        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.\n        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return \"NO\".\n        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return \"YES\".\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                # We need to check if we can make the sum of A equal to zero\n                # by reducing it by multiples of the sum of indices (1 to N)\n                if sum_A % required_sum == 0:\n                    # Calculate how many times we need to perform the operation\n                    k = sum_A // required_sum\n                    # Check if we can distribute k operations across the sequence\n                    possible = True\n                    for i in range(N):\n                        # Calculate the required change for A[i]\n                        change = A[i] - (k * (i + 1))\n                        if change < 0:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n            \n                    if possible:\n                        results.append(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code\n\n        - **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices (1 to N).\n        - **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices.

This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.\n\n        2. **Key Insight**: The sum of the sequence can be adjusted by reducing each element by its index.

This means we should simulate the process of adjusting the sequence to see if we can reach a sum of zero.\n\n        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:\n\n        - Start with the sum of the sequence.\n        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.\n        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return \"NO\".\n        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return \"YES\".\n\n        ### Revised Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = 0\n        \n                for i from 1 to N:\n                    required_sum += i\n                    if sum_A < required_sum:\n                        print \"NO\"\n                        break\n                    sum_A -= required_sum\n        \n                if sum_A == 0:\n                    print \"YES\"\n        ```\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = 0\n                possible = True\n        \n                for i in range(1, N + 1):\n                    required_sum += i\n                    if sum_A < required_sum:\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                    sum_A -= i\n        \n                if possible and sum_A == 0:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Revised Code\n\n        - **Iterative Adjustment**: The code iteratively checks if the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero by simulating the process of reducing each element by its index.\n        - **Feasibility Check**: If at any point the sum of the sequence cannot be adjusted to meet the required sum, it returns \"NO\".\n        - **Final Check**: If the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, it returns \"YES\".\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's correct the solution by properly simulating the process of adjusting the sequence to make it sum to zero.

This assumption is flawed because it doesn't account for the individual adjustments needed for each element.\n\n        ### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n        1. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The solution assumes that divisibility by the sum of indices is sufficient to determine if the sequence can be made to sum to zero. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the specific adjustments needed for each element.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Feasibility Check**: The check for whether each element can be adjusted by `k` operations is not correctly implemented. The logic should ensure that the cumulative adjustments can lead to a zero sum, not just individual feasibility.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        1. **Cumulative Adjustment Simulation**: We need to simulate the process of adjusting each element by its index and ensure that the cumulative effect can lead to a zero sum.\n\n        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:\n\n        - Start with the sum of the sequence.\n        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.\n        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return \"NO\".\n        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return \"YES\".\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                # We need to check if we can make the sum of A equal to zero\n                # by reducing it by multiples of the sum of indices (1 to N)\n                if sum_A % required_sum == 0:\n                    # Calculate how many times we need to perform the operation\n                    k = sum_A // required_sum\n                    # Check if we can distribute k operations across the sequence\n                    possible = True\n                    for i in range(N):\n                        # Calculate the required change for A[i]\n                        change = A[i] - (k * (i + 1))\n                        if change < 0:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n            \n                    if possible:\n                        results.append(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code\n\n        - **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices (1 to N).\n        - **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices.

This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.\n\n        2. **Key Insight**: The sum of the sequence can be adjusted by reducing each element by its index.

This means we should simulate the process of adjusting the sequence to see if we can reach a sum of zero.\n\n        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:\n\n        - Start with the sum of the sequence.\n        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.\n        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return \"NO\".\n        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return \"YES\".\n\n        ### Revised Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = 0\n        \n                for i from 1 to N:\n                    required_sum += i\n                    if sum_A < required_sum:\n                        print \"NO\"\n                        break\n                    sum_A -= required_sum\n        \n                if sum_A == 0:\n                    print \"YES\"\n        ```\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = 0\n                possible = True\n        \n                for i in range(1, N + 1):\n                    required_sum += i\n                    if sum_A < required_sum:\n                        possible = False\n                        break\n                    sum_A -= i\n        \n                if possible and sum_A == 0:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Revised Code\n\n        - **Iterative Adjustment**: The code iteratively checks if the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero by simulating the process of reducing each element by its index.\n        - **Feasibility Check**: If at any point the sum of the sequence cannot be adjusted to meet the required sum, it returns \"NO\".\n        - **Final Check**: If the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, it returns \"YES\".\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's correct the solution by properly simulating the process of adjusting the sequence to make it sum to zero.

The solution should check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions is exactly equal to the amount of money Gru has.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        # Unpack the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has\n        N, K = test_case[0]\n        # Unpack the list of demands\n        demands = test_case[1]\n        \n        # Calculate the total demand\n        total_demand = sum(demands)\n        \n        # Check if the total demand is equal to the money Gru has\n        if total_demand == K:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n        index += 2\n        demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n    \n    can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Corrected Code\n\n- **Input Parsing**: The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. We then parse the number of test cases and for each test case, we parse the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n- **Logic**: For each test case, we calculate the total demand by summing the list of demands. We then check if this total demand is equal to the amount of money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money, and we append \"YES\" to the results. Otherwise, we append \"NO\".\n- **Output**: Finally, we print the results for each test case."

        "content": "In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n- **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n### Challenges and Fixes:\n- **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n- **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n### Corrected Code:\nThe final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n```python\ndef can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K = test_case[0]\n        demands = test_case[1]\n        total_demand = sum(demands)\n        if total_demand == K:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n        index += 2\n        demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n    can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The task is to determine if Gru can distribute all his money such that he has none left. This means checking if there is a subset of the minions' demands that sums exactly to the amount of money Gru has.\n\n2. **My Approach:**\n   - My initial approach was to simply check if the total sum of all demands equals the money Gru has. This was incorrect because it didn't account for the possibility of using a subset of demands to exactly match the available money.\n\n3. **Official Solution Insight:**\n   - The official solution uses a recursive function `find_combinations` to find all possible combinations of demands that sum up to the given amount. This approach effectively checks for any subset of demands that can sum to the exact amount of money Gru has.\n   - The solution sorts the demands first, which can help in optimizing the search for combinations, though sorting isn't strictly necessary for correctness.\n\n4. **Key Takeaways:**\n   - The problem is essentially a subset sum problem, which is a classic problem in computer science. Recognizing this pattern is crucial for applying the correct algorithm.\n   - The recursive approach in the official solution is a brute-force method that explores all possible subsets. While it may not be the most efficient for large inputs, it is straightforward and guarantees correctness for the given constraints.\n   - In future problems, it's important to consider not just the total sum but also the possibility of using subsets to achieve a target sum.\n\n5. **Improvement:**\n   - For large inputs, a more efficient approach like dynamic programming could be used to solve the subset sum problem, reducing the time complexity compared to the recursive approach.\n\nThis experience highlights the importance of recognizing problem patterns and applying appropriate algorithms, especially for problems involving combinations or subsets."
