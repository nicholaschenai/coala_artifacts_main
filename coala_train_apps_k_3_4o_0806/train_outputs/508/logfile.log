## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a street represented as a number line with several roadworks scheduled at specific points. Each roadwork blocks a specific point on the number line for a given time interval. Multiple people start walking from the origin (coordinate 0) at different times, moving at a constant speed of 1 unit per time unit. Each person stops walking when they reach a blocked point. We need to determine the distance each person walks before stopping or if they walk indefinitely.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: First, we need to parse the input to get the number of roadworks, the number of people, the details of each roadwork (start time, end time, and blocked coordinate), and the start times for each person.

2. **Event Creation**: For each roadwork, create two events: one for the start of the roadwork and one for the end. These events will help us track when a point becomes blocked and unblocked.

3. **Event Processing**: Sort all events by time. As we process each event, maintain a set of currently blocked points. This will allow us to quickly check if a person will stop at a given point.

4. **Simulate Walking**: For each person, simulate their walk:
   - Start at time `D_i` and coordinate 0.
   - Move forward in time and coordinate until reaching a blocked point or until all events are processed.
   - If a blocked point is reached, record the distance walked.
   - If no blocked point is reached by the end of all events, the person walks indefinitely.

5. **Output Results**: For each person, output the distance walked or -1 if they walk indefinitely.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_events(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for each roadwork (S_i, T_i, X_i):
        add event (S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i) to events
        add event (T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i) to events
    
    sort events by time

    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    current_person_index = 0

    for each event in events:
        time, event_type, x = event

        while current_person_index < Q and start_times[current_person_index] <= time:
            person_start_time = start_times[current_person_index]
            distance = person_start_time + len(blocked_points)
            if distance in blocked_points:
                results.append(distance)
            else:
                results.append(-1)
            current_person_index += 1

        if event_type == 'start':
            blocked_points.add(x)
        elif event_type == 'end':
            blocked_points.remove(x)

    while current_person_index < Q:
        results.append(-1)
        current_person_index += 1

    return results

# Read input
N, Q = read integers
roadworks = read N tuples (S_i, T_i, X_i)
start_times = read Q integers (D_i)

# Process and output results
results = process_events(N, Q, roadworks, start_times)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def process_events(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for S_i, T_i, X_i in roadworks:
        events.append((S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i))
        events.append((T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i))
    
    # Sort events by time, and in case of tie, 'end' should come before 'start'
    events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1] == 'start'))
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    current_person_index = 0

    for time, event_type, x in events:
        # Process all people who start walking before or at this event time
        while current_person_index < Q and start_times[current_person_index] <= time:
            person_start_time = start_times[current_person_index]
            distance = person_start_time
            while distance not in blocked_points:
                if distance in blocked_points:
                    results.append(distance)
                    break
                distance += 1
            else:
                results.append(-1)
            current_person_index += 1

        # Update blocked points based on the event type
        if event_type == 'start':
            blocked_points.add(x)
        elif event_type == 'end':
            blocked_points.remove(x)

    # Any remaining people will walk indefinitely
    while current_person_index < Q:
        results.append(-1)
        current_person_index += 1

    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
Q = int(data[1])

roadworks = []
index = 2
for _ in range(N):
    S_i = int(data[index])
    T_i = int(data[index + 1])
    X_i = int(data[index + 2])
    roadworks.append((S_i, T_i, X_i))
    index += 3

start_times = []
for _ in range(Q):
    D_i = int(data[index])
    start_times.append(D_i)
    index += 1

# Process and output results
results = process_events(N, Q, roadworks, start_times)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution efficiently processes the events and simulates the walking of each person, ensuring that the constraints are respected and the solution is optimal for large inputs.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break to reach the origin from a given starting point, or if the starting point lies on a wall. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant, and the solution required efficient handling of multiple test cases with potentially large input sizes.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Set for Fast Lookup**: Using a set to store wall positions allowed for O(1) time complexity when checking if a starting point lies on a wall.
    - **Counting with Conditions**: The problem required counting how many wall positions are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point. This was efficiently handled by iterating over the sorted list of wall positions.

    ### Strategies
    - **Input Parsing and Management**: Efficiently parsing input and managing indices was crucial given the constraints.
    - **Iterative Counting**: Instead of using complex data structures, a simple iteration over the sorted list of wall positions was sufficient to count the walls Chef needs to break.

    ### Code Snippet
    ```python
    a_set = set(a)  # Convert list to set for O(1) lookup
    for _ in range(Q):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
    
        sum_xy = x + y
        if sum_xy in a_set:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            count = 0
            for ai in a:
                if ai > sum_xy:
                    count += 1
            results.append(count)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of using appropriate data structures for fast lookups and the simplicity of iterative solutions when dealing with sorted data. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.
[/Summary]


[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        -----Sample Input-----
        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). The walls are represented as line segments from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i) for each wall i. For each starting position (x_j, y_j) of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are between Chef and the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Input Parsing**: We will first read the number of test cases. For each test case, we will read the number of walls and their positions, followed by the number of queries and the starting positions for each query.

        2. **Wall Check**: For each query, check if the starting position (x_j, y_j) lies on any wall. A point (x, y) lies on the wall defined by a_i if x + y = a_i.

        3. **Counting Walls**: If the point is not on any wall, count how many walls are between the point and the origin. This can be done by counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.

        4. **Output**: For each query, output the number of walls Chef needs to break or -1 if the starting point is on a wall.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function process_test_cases():
            read T  # number of test cases
            for each test case:
                read N  # number of walls
                read a  # list of N integers representing wall positions
                read Q  # number of queries
                for each query:
                    read x, y  # starting position of Chef
                    if x + y is in a:
                        print -1

        ### Explanation

        - **Set for Fast Lookup**: We use a set to quickly check if a point lies on a wall.
        - **Counting Walls**: We iterate over the list of wall positions to count how many are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point.
        - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints by using set operations and simple iteration, ensuring it can process up to the maximum input sizes specified.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a street represented as a number line running from west to east. There are N roadworks scheduled, each blocking a specific point on the line for a given time interval. Q people start walking from coordinate 0 at different times, each moving at a speed of 1 unit per time unit. Each person stops walking when they reach a blocked point. We need to determine the distance each person will walk.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: First, read the number of roadworks (N) and the number of people (Q). Then, read the details of each roadwork and the start times for each person.

2. **Event Creation**: For each roadwork, create two events: one for the start of the blocking and one for the end. These events will help us track when a point becomes blocked and unblocked.

3. **Event Sorting**: Sort all events by time. If two events have the same time, prioritize the start of a blocking over the end of a blocking.

4. **Simulate Walking**: For each person, simulate their walk:
   - Use a pointer to track the current event.
   - Move the person forward in time and position until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

5. **Output**: For each person, output the distance they walked or -1 if they walked indefinitely.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for each roadwork (S_i, T_i, X_i):
        add event (S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i) to events
        add event (T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i) to events
    
    sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0
    
    for each start_time in start_times:
        current_time = start_time
        current_position = 0
        
        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index].time <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event.type == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event.position)
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event.position)
            event_index += 1
        
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index].time
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results
```

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a street represented as a number line running from west to east. There are N roadworks scheduled, each blocking a specific point on the line for a given time interval. Q people start walking from coordinate 0 at different times, each moving at a speed of 1 unit per time unit. Each person stops walking when they reach a blocked point. We need to determine the distance each person will walk.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: First, read the number of roadworks (N) and the number of people (Q). Then, read the details of each roadwork and the start times for each person.

2. **Event Creation**: For each roadwork, create two events: one for the start of the blocking and one for the end. These events will help us track when a point becomes blocked and unblocked.

3. **Event Sorting**: Sort all events by time. If two events have the same time, prioritize the start of a blocking over the end of a blocking.

4. **Simulate Walking**: For each person, simulate their walk:
   - Use a pointer to track the current event.
   - Move the person forward in time and position until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

5. **Output**: For each person, output the distance they walked or -1 if they walked indefinitely.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for each roadwork (S_i, T_i, X_i):
        add event (S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i) to events
        add event (T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i) to events
    
    sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0
    
    for each start_time in start_times:
        current_time = start_time
        current_position = 0
        
        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index].time <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event.type == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event.position)
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event.position)
            event_index += 1
        
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index].time
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for S_i, T_i, X_i in roadworks:
        events.append((S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i))
        events.append((T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i))
    
    # Sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1] == 'end'))
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0
    
    for start_time in start_times:
        current_time = start_time
        current_position = 0
        
        # Process all events up to the current time
        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index][0] <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event[1] == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event[2])
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event[2])
            event_index += 1
        
        # Move the person until they hit a blocked point or run out of events
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index][0]
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

index = 0
N = int(data[index])
Q = int(data[index + 1])
index += 2

roadworks = []
for _ in range(N):
    S_i = int(data[index])
    T_i = int(data[index + 1])
    X_i = int(data[index + 2])
    roadworks.append((S_i, T_i, X_i))
    index += 3

start_times = []
for _ in range(Q):
    D_i = int(data[index])
    start_times.append(D_i)
    index += 1

# Calculate distances
results = calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by using event-driven simulation and set operations to track blocked points.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code correctly creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition `if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true. This condition should instead check if the person can move to the next event time without encountering a blocked point.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

Let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for S_i, T_i, X_i in roadworks:
        events.append((S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i))

        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index][0] <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event[1] == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event[2])

                else:

This revised code should correctly simulate each person's walk and determine the distance they walk or if they walk indefinitely.

There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a street represented as a number line running from west to east. There are N roadworks scheduled, each blocking a specific point on the line for a given time interval. Q people start walking from coordinate 0 at different times, each moving at a speed of 1 unit per time unit. Each person stops walking when they reach a blocked point. We need to determine the distance each person will walk.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: First, read the number of roadworks (N) and the number of people (Q). Then, read the details of each roadwork and the start times for each person.

2. **Event Creation**: For each roadwork, create two events: one for the start of the blocking and one for the end. These events will help us track when a point becomes blocked and unblocked.

3. **Event Sorting**: Sort all events by time. If two events have the same time, prioritize the start of a blocking over the end of a blocking.

4. **Simulate Walking**: For each person, simulate their walk:
   - Use a pointer to track the current event.
   - Move the person forward in time and position until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

5. **Output**: For each person, output the distance they walked or -1 if they walked indefinitely.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for each roadwork (S_i, T_i, X_i):
        add event (S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i) to events
        add event (T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i) to events
    
    sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0
    
    for each start_time in start_times:
        current_time = start_time
        current_position = 0
        
        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index].time <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event.type == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event.position)
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event.position)
            event_index += 1
        
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index].time
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results
```

### Final Python Solution

        events.append((S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i))
        events.append((T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i))
    
    # Sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal

            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event[2])
            event_index += 1
        
        # Move the person until they hit a blocked point or run out of events
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index][0]
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

index = 0
N = int(data[index])
Q = int(data[index + 1])
index += 2

roadworks = []
for _ in range(N):
    S_i = int(data[index])
    T_i = int(data[index + 1])
    X_i = int(data[index + 2])
    roadworks.append((S_i, T_i, X_i))
    index += 3

start_times = []
for _ in range(Q):
    D_i = int(data[index])
    start_times.append(D_i)
    index += 1

# Calculate distances
results = calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by using event-driven simulation and set operations to track blocked points.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code correctly creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition `if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true. This condition should instead check if the person can move to the next event time without encountering a blocked point.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

Let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break to reach the origin from a given starting point, or if the starting point lies on a wall. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant, and the solution required efficient handling of multiple test cases with potentially large input sizes.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Set for Fast Lookup**: Using a set to store wall positions allowed for O(1) time complexity when checking if a starting point lies on a wall.
    - **Counting with Conditions**: The problem required counting how many wall positions are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point. This was efficiently handled by iterating over the sorted list of wall positions.

    ### Strategies
    - **Input Parsing and Management**: Efficiently parsing input and managing indices was crucial given the constraints.
    - **Iterative Counting**: Instead of using complex data structures, a simple iteration over the sorted list of wall positions was sufficient to count the walls Chef needs to break.

    ### Code Snippet
    ```python
    a_set = set(a)  # Convert list to set for O(1) lookup
    for _ in range(Q):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
    
        sum_xy = x + y
        if sum_xy in a_set:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            count = 0
            for ai in a:
                if ai > sum_xy:
                    count += 1
            results.append(count)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of using appropriate data structures for fast lookups and the simplicity of iterative solutions when dealing with sorted data. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        -----Sample Input-----
        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). The walls are represented as line segments from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i) for each wall i. For each starting position (x_j, y_j) of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are between Chef and the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Input Parsing**: We will first read the number of test cases. For each test case, we will read the number of walls and their positions, followed by the number of queries and the starting positions for each query.

        2. **Wall Check**: For each query, check if the starting position (x_j, y_j) lies on any wall. A point (x, y) lies on the wall defined by a_i if x + y = a_i.

        3. **Counting Walls**: If the point is not on any wall, count how many walls are between the point and the origin. This can be done by counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.

        4. **Output**: For each query, output the number of walls Chef needs to break or -1 if the starting point is on a wall.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function process_test_cases():
            read T  # number of test cases
            for each test case:
                read N  # number of walls
                read a  # list of N integers representing wall positions
                read Q  # number of queries
                for each query:
                    read x, y  # starting position of Chef
                    if x + y is in a:
                        print -1
                    else:
                        count = number of elements in a greater than x + y
                        print count
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def process_test_cases():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
    
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                index += 1
                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
                index += N
                Q = int(data[index])
                index += 1
        
                a_set = set(a)  # Convert list to set for O(1) lookup
                for _ in range(Q):
                    x = int(data[index])
                    y = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    sum_xy = x + y
                    if sum_xy in a_set:
                        results.append(-1)
                    else:
                        # Count how many a_i are greater than sum_xy
                        count = 0
                        for ai in a:
                            if ai > sum_xy:
                                count += 1
                        results.append(count)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        process_test_cases()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Set for Fast Lookup**: We use a set to quickly check if a point lies on a wall.
        - **Counting Walls**: We iterate over the list of wall positions to count how many are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point.
        - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints by using set operations and simple iteration, ensuring it can process up to the maximum input sizes specified.

            else:

        # Move the person until they hit a blocked point or run out of events

                results.append(current_position)

            next_event_time = events[event_index][0]
            time_to_next_event = next_event_time - current_time
            if current_position + time_to_next_event in blocked_points:

### Key Fixes:
- **Event Processing**: Ensure that events are processed correctly up to the current time for each person.
- **Movement Simulation**: Correctly simulate the movement of each person, checking for blocked points at each step.
- **Output**: Ensure the correct distance is output for each person, or -1 if they walk indefinitely.

This solution should now correctly handle the constraints and provide the expected output for each test case.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a street represented as a number line running from west to east. There are N roadworks scheduled, each blocking a specific point on the line for a given time interval. Q people start walking from coordinate 0 at different times, each moving at a speed of 1 unit per time unit. Each person stops walking when they reach a blocked point. We need to determine the distance each person will walk.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: First, read the number of roadworks (N) and the number of people (Q). Then, read the details of each roadwork and the start times for each person.

2. **Event Creation**: For each roadwork, create two events: one for the start of the blocking and one for the end. These events will help us track when a point becomes blocked and unblocked.

3. **Event Sorting**: Sort all events by time. If two events have the same time, prioritize the start of a blocking over the end of a blocking.

4. **Simulate Walking**: For each person, simulate their walk:
   - Use a pointer to track the current event.
   - Move the person forward in time and position until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

5. **Output**: For each person, output the distance they walked or -1 if they walked indefinitely.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for each roadwork (S_i, T_i, X_i):
        add event (S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i) to events
        add event (T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i) to events
    
    sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0
    
    for each start_time in start_times:
        current_time = start_time
        current_position = 0
        
        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index].time <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event.type == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event.position)
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event.position)
            event_index += 1
        
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index].time
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results
```

### Final Python Solution

# Calculate distances
results = calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by using event-driven simulation and set operations to track blocked points.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code correctly creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition `if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true. This condition should instead check if the person can move to the next event time without encountering a blocked point.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

This revised code should correctly simulate each person's walk and determine the distance they walk or if they walk indefinitely.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

-----Sample Input-----

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a street represented as a number line running from west to east. There are N roadworks scheduled, each blocking a specific point on the line for a given time interval. Q people start walking from coordinate 0 at different times, each moving at a speed of 1 unit per time unit. Each person stops walking when they reach a blocked point. We need to determine the distance each person will walk.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: First, read the number of roadworks (N) and the number of people (Q). Then, read the details of each roadwork and the start times for each person.

2. **Event Creation**: For each roadwork, create two events: one for the start of the blocking and one for the end. These events will help us track when a point becomes blocked and unblocked.

3. **Event Sorting**: Sort all events by time. If two events have the same time, prioritize the start of a blocking over the end of a blocking.

4. **Simulate Walking**: For each person, simulate their walk:
   - Use a pointer to track the current event.
   - Move the person forward in time and position until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

5. **Output**: For each person, output the distance they walked or -1 if they walked indefinitely.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for each roadwork (S_i, T_i, X_i):
        add event (S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i) to events
        add event (T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i) to events
    
    sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0
    
    for each start_time in start_times:
        current_time = start_time
        current_position = 0
        
        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index].time <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event.type == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event.position)
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event.position)
            event_index += 1
        
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index].time
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results
```

### Final Python Solution

        events.append((S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i))
        events.append((T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i))
    
    # Sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1] == 'end'))
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0

                blocked_points.add(event[2])
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event[2])
            event_index += 1
        
        # Move the person until they hit a blocked point or run out of events

            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

index = 0
N = int(data[index])
Q = int(data[index + 1])
index += 2

roadworks = []
for _ in range(N):
    S_i = int(data[index])
    T_i = int(data[index + 1])
    X_i = int(data[index + 2])
    roadworks.append((S_i, T_i, X_i))
    index += 3

start_times = []
for _ in range(Q):
    D_i = int(data[index])
    start_times.append(D_i)
    index += 1

# Calculate distances
results = calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by using event-driven simulation and set operations to track blocked points.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code correctly creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition `if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true. This condition should instead check if the person can move to the next event time without encountering a blocked point.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

Let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python

            while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index][0] <= current_time:
                event = events[event_index]
                if event[1] == 'start':

                else:
                    blocked_points.remove(event[2])
                event_index += 1

### Key Fixes:
- **Event Processing**: Ensure that events are processed correctly up to the current time for each person.
- **Movement Simulation**: Correctly simulate the movement of each person, checking for blocked points at each step.
- **Output**: Ensure the correct distance is output for each person, or -1 if they walk indefinitely.

This solution should now correctly handle the constraints and provide the expected output for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues that could lead to runtime errors or inefficiencies:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition for moving the person to the next event time might not correctly simulate the person's movement.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

- **Infinite Loop or Inefficiency**: The while loop that simulates the person's movement might not terminate correctly if the logic for checking blocked points is incorrect.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

Let's implement these corrections in the code.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break to reach the origin from a given starting point, or if the starting point lies on a wall. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant, and the solution required efficient handling of multiple test cases with potentially large input sizes.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Set for Fast Lookup**: Using a set to store wall positions allowed for O(1) time complexity when checking if a starting point lies on a wall.
    - **Counting with Conditions**: The problem required counting how many wall positions are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point. This was efficiently handled by iterating over the sorted list of wall positions.

    ### Strategies
    - **Input Parsing and Management**: Efficiently parsing input and managing indices was crucial given the constraints.
    - **Iterative Counting**: Instead of using complex data structures, a simple iteration over the sorted list of wall positions was sufficient to count the walls Chef needs to break.

    ### Code Snippet
    ```python
    a_set = set(a)  # Convert list to set for O(1) lookup
    for _ in range(Q):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
    
        sum_xy = x + y
        if sum_xy in a_set:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            count = 0
            for ai in a:
                if ai > sum_xy:
                    count += 1
            results.append(count)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of using appropriate data structures for fast lookups and the simplicity of iterative solutions when dealing with sorted data. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        -----Sample Input-----
        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). The walls are represented as line segments from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i) for each wall i. For each starting position (x_j, y_j) of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are between Chef and the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Input Parsing**: We will first read the number of test cases. For each test case, we will read the number of walls and their positions, followed by the number of queries and the starting positions for each query.

        2. **Wall Check**: For each query, check if the starting position (x_j, y_j) lies on any wall. A point (x, y) lies on the wall defined by a_i if x + y = a_i.

        3. **Counting Walls**: If the point is not on any wall, count how many walls are between the point and the origin. This can be done by counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.

        4. **Output**: For each query, output the number of walls Chef needs to break or -1 if the starting point is on a wall.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function process_test_cases():
            read T  # number of test cases
            for each test case:
                read N  # number of walls
                read a  # list of N integers representing wall positions
                read Q  # number of queries
                for each query:
                    read x, y  # starting position of Chef
                    if x + y is in a:
                        print -1
                    else:
                        count = number of elements in a greater than x + y
                        print count
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def process_test_cases():
            import sys

                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))

                    y = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    sum_xy = x + y
                    if sum_xy in a_set:
                        results.append(-1)
                    else:
                        # Count how many a_i are greater than sum_xy
                        count = 0
                        for ai in a:
                            if ai > sum_xy:

                        results.append(count)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        process_test_cases()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Set for Fast Lookup**: We use a set to quickly check if a point lies on a wall.
        - **Counting Walls**: We iterate over the list of wall positions to count how many are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point.
        - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints by using set operations and simple iteration, ensuring it can process up to the maximum input sizes specified.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] Let's address the issues in the previous solution and provide a corrected version. The main problem was with the logic for simulating the movement of each person and checking for blocked points. Here's the corrected code:

### Key Fixes:
- **Event Processing**: Ensure that events are processed correctly up to the current time for each person.
- **Movement Simulation**: Correctly simulate the movement of each person, checking for blocked points at each step.
- **Output**: Ensure the correct distance is output for each person, or -1 if they walk indefinitely.

This solution should now correctly handle the constraints and provide the expected output for each test case.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

-----Sample Input-----
4 6
1 3 2
7 13 10
18 20 13
3 4 2
0
1
2
3

-----Sample Output-----

10
-1
13
-1

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a street represented as a number line running from west to east. There are N roadworks scheduled, each blocking a specific point on the line for a given time interval. Q people start walking from coordinate 0 at different times, each moving at a speed of 1 unit per time unit. Each person stops walking when they reach a blocked point. We need to determine the distance each person will walk.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: First, read the number of roadworks (N) and the number of people (Q). Then, read the details of each roadwork and the start times for each person.

2. **Event Creation**: For each roadwork, create two events: one for the start of the blocking and one for the end. These events will help us track when a point becomes blocked and unblocked.

3. **Event Sorting**: Sort all events by time. If two events have the same time, prioritize the start of a blocking over the end of a blocking.

4. **Simulate Walking**: For each person, simulate their walk:
   - Use a pointer to track the current event.
   - Move the person forward in time and position until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

5. **Output**: For each person, output the distance they walked or -1 if they walked indefinitely.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for each roadwork (S_i, T_i, X_i):
        add event (S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i) to events
        add event (T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i) to events
    
    sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0
    
    for each start_time in start_times:
        current_time = start_time
        current_position = 0
        
        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index].time <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event.type == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event.position)
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event.position)
            event_index += 1
        
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index].time
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results

```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by using event-driven simulation and set operations to track blocked points.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code correctly creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition `if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true. This condition should instead check if the person can move to the next event time without encountering a blocked point.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition for moving the person to the next event time might not correctly simulate the person's movement.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

- **Infinite Loop or Inefficiency**: The while loop that simulates the person's movement might not terminate correctly if the logic for checking blocked points is incorrect.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

Let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for S_i, T_i, X_i in roadworks:
        events.append((S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i))
        events.append((T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i))
    
    # Sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1] == 'end'))
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0
    
    for start_time in start_times:
        current_time = start_time
        current_position = 0
        
        # Process all events up to the current time
        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index][0] <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event[1] == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event[2])
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event[2])
            event_index += 1
        
        # Move the person until they hit a blocked point or run out of events
        while True:
            if current_position in blocked_points:
                results.append(current_position)
                break
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index][0]
            time_to_next_event = next_event_time - current_time
            if current_position + time_to_next_event in blocked_points:
                results.append(current_position + time_to_next_event)
                break
            current_position += time_to_next_event
            current_time = next_event_time
            
            # Process events at the new current time
            while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index][0] <= current_time:
                event = events[event_index]
                if event[1] == 'start':
                    blocked_points.add(event[2])
                else:
                    blocked_points.remove(event[2])
                event_index += 1
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

index = 0
N = int(data[index])
Q = int(data[index + 1])
index += 2

roadworks = []
for _ in range(N):
    S_i = int(data[index])
    T_i = int(data[index + 1])
    X_i = int(data[index + 2])
    roadworks.append((S_i, T_i, X_i))
    index += 3

start_times = []
for _ in range(Q):
    D_i = int(data[index])
    start_times.append(D_i)
    index += 1

# Calculate distances
results = calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This revised code should correctly simulate each person's walk and determine the distance they walk or if they walk indefinitely.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

-----Sample Input-----

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a street represented as a number line running from west to east. There are N roadworks scheduled, each blocking a specific point on the line for a given time interval. Q people start walking from coordinate 0 at different times, each moving at a speed of 1 unit per time unit. Each person stops walking when they reach a blocked point. We need to determine the distance each person will walk.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: First, read the number of roadworks (N) and the number of people (Q). Then, read the details of each roadwork and the start times for each person.

2. **Event Creation**: For each roadwork, create two events: one for the start of the blocking and one for the end. These events will help us track when a point becomes blocked and unblocked.

3. **Event Sorting**: Sort all events by time. If two events have the same time, prioritize the start of a blocking over the end of a blocking.

4. **Simulate Walking**: For each person, simulate their walk:
   - Use a pointer to track the current event.
   - Move the person forward in time and position until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

5. **Output**: For each person, output the distance they walked or -1 if they walked indefinitely.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for each roadwork (S_i, T_i, X_i):
        add event (S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i) to events
        add event (T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i) to events
    
    sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0
    
    for each start_time in start_times:
        current_time = start_time
        current_position = 0
        
        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index].time <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event.type == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event.position)
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event.position)
            event_index += 1
        
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index].time
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results
```

        events.append((S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i))
        events.append((T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i))
    
    # Sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1] == 'end'))

                blocked_points.add(event[2])
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event[2])
            event_index += 1
        
        # Move the person until they hit a blocked point or run out of events
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index][0]
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

index = 0
N = int(data[index])
Q = int(data[index + 1])
index += 2

roadworks = []
for _ in range(N):
    S_i = int(data[index])
    T_i = int(data[index + 1])
    X_i = int(data[index + 2])
    roadworks.append((S_i, T_i, X_i))
    index += 3

start_times = []
for _ in range(Q):
    D_i = int(data[index])
    start_times.append(D_i)
    index += 1

# Calculate distances
results = calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by using event-driven simulation and set operations to track blocked points.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code correctly creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition `if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true. This condition should instead check if the person can move to the next event time without encountering a blocked point.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

Let's implement these corrections in the code.

### Key Fixes:
- **Event Processing**: Ensure that events are processed correctly up to the current time for each person.
- **Movement Simulation**: Correctly simulate the movement of each person, checking for blocked points at each step.
- **Output**: Ensure the correct distance is output for each person, or -1 if they walk indefinitely.

This solution should now correctly handle the constraints and provide the expected output for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues that could lead to runtime errors or inefficiencies:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition for moving the person to the next event time might not correctly simulate the person's movement.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

- **Infinite Loop or Inefficiency**: The while loop that simulates the person's movement might not terminate correctly if the logic for checking blocked points is incorrect.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break to reach the origin from a given starting point, or if the starting point lies on a wall. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant, and the solution required efficient handling of multiple test cases with potentially large input sizes.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Set for Fast Lookup**: Using a set to store wall positions allowed for O(1) time complexity when checking if a starting point lies on a wall.
    - **Counting with Conditions**: The problem required counting how many wall positions are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point. This was efficiently handled by iterating over the sorted list of wall positions.

    ### Strategies
    - **Input Parsing and Management**: Efficiently parsing input and managing indices was crucial given the constraints.
    - **Iterative Counting**: Instead of using complex data structures, a simple iteration over the sorted list of wall positions was sufficient to count the walls Chef needs to break.

    ### Code Snippet
    ```python
    a_set = set(a)  # Convert list to set for O(1) lookup
    for _ in range(Q):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
    
        sum_xy = x + y
        if sum_xy in a_set:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            count = 0
            for ai in a:
                if ai > sum_xy:
                    count += 1
            results.append(count)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of using appropriate data structures for fast lookups and the simplicity of iterative solutions when dealing with sorted data. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        -----Sample Input-----
        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). The walls are represented as line segments from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i) for each wall i. For each starting position (x_j, y_j) of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are between Chef and the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Input Parsing**: We will first read the number of test cases. For each test case, we will read the number of walls and their positions, followed by the number of queries and the starting positions for each query.

        2. **Wall Check**: For each query, check if the starting position (x_j, y_j) lies on any wall. A point (x, y) lies on the wall defined by a_i if x + y = a_i.

        3. **Counting Walls**: If the point is not on any wall, count how many walls are between the point and the origin. This can be done by counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.

        4. **Output**: For each query, output the number of walls Chef needs to break or -1 if the starting point is on a wall.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function process_test_cases():
            read T  # number of test cases
            for each test case:
                read N  # number of walls
                read a  # list of N integers representing wall positions
                read Q  # number of queries
                for each query:
                    read x, y  # starting position of Chef
                    if x + y is in a:
                        print -1
                    else:
                        count = number of elements in a greater than x + y
                        print count
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def process_test_cases():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
    
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                index += 1
                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
                index += N
                Q = int(data[index])
                index += 1
        
                a_set = set(a)  # Convert list to set for O(1) lookup
                for _ in range(Q):
                    x = int(data[index])
                    y = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    sum_xy = x + y
                    if sum_xy in a_set:
                        results.append(-1)
                    else:
                        # Count how many a_i are greater than sum_xy
                        count = 0
                        for ai in a:
                            if ai > sum_xy:
                                count += 1
                        results.append(count)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        process_test_cases()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Set for Fast Lookup**: We use a set to quickly check if a point lies on a wall.
        - **Counting Walls**: We iterate over the list of wall positions to count how many are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point.
        - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints by using set operations and simple iteration, ensuring it can process up to the maximum input sizes specified.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] Let's address the issues in the previous solution and provide a corrected version. The main problem was with the logic for simulating the movement of each person and checking for blocked points. Here's the corrected code:

    for S_i, T_i, X_i in roadworks:
        events.append((S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i))

            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event[2])
            event_index += 1
        
        # Move the person until they hit a blocked point or run out of events

            if current_position in blocked_points:
                results.append(current_position)

            next_event_time = events[event_index][0]

### Key Fixes:
- **Event Processing**: Ensure that events are processed correctly up to the current time for each person.
- **Movement Simulation**: Correctly simulate the movement of each person, checking for blocked points at each step.
- **Output**: Ensure the correct distance is output for each person, or -1 if they walk indefinitely.

This solution should now correctly handle the constraints and provide the expected output for each test case.

### Key Fixes:
- **Event Processing**: Ensure that events are processed correctly up to the current time for each person.
- **Movement Simulation**: Correctly simulate the movement of each person, checking for blocked points at each step.
- **Output**: Ensure the correct distance is output for each person, or -1 if they walk indefinitely.

This solution should now correctly handle the constraints and provide the expected output for each test case.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

-----Sample Input-----

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a street represented as a number line running from west to east. There are N roadworks scheduled, each blocking a specific point on the line for a given time interval. Q people start walking from coordinate 0 at different times, each moving at a speed of 1 unit per time unit. Each person stops walking when they reach a blocked point. We need to determine the distance each person will walk.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: First, read the number of roadworks (N) and the number of people (Q). Then, read the details of each roadwork and the start times for each person.

2. **Event Creation**: For each roadwork, create two events: one for the start of the blocking and one for the end. These events will help us track when a point becomes blocked and unblocked.

3. **Event Sorting**: Sort all events by time. If two events have the same time, prioritize the start of a blocking over the end of a blocking.

4. **Simulate Walking**: For each person, simulate their walk:
   - Use a pointer to track the current event.
   - Move the person forward in time and position until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

5. **Output**: For each person, output the distance they walked or -1 if they walked indefinitely.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for each roadwork (S_i, T_i, X_i):
        add event (S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i) to events
        add event (T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i) to events
    
    sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0
    
    for each start_time in start_times:
        current_time = start_time
        current_position = 0
        
        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index].time <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event.type == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event.position)
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event.position)
            event_index += 1
        
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index].time
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results
```

                current_time = next_event_time
            else:

                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results

    index += 1

# Calculate distances
results = calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by using event-driven simulation and set operations to track blocked points.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code correctly creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition `if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true. This condition should instead check if the person can move to the next event time without encountering a blocked point.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

Let's implement these corrections in the code.

### Key Fixes:
- **Event Processing**: Ensure that events are processed correctly up to the current time for each person.
- **Movement Simulation**: Correctly simulate the movement of each person, checking for blocked points at each step.
- **Output**: Ensure the correct distance is output for each person, or -1 if they walk indefinitely.

This solution should now correctly handle the constraints and provide the expected output for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues that could lead to runtime errors or inefficiencies:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition for moving the person to the next event time might not correctly simulate the person's movement.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

- **Infinite Loop or Inefficiency**: The while loop that simulates the person's movement might not terminate correctly if the logic for checking blocked points is incorrect.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

### Key Fixes:
- **Event Processing**: Ensure that events are processed correctly up to the current time for each person.
- **Movement Simulation**: Correctly simulate the movement of each person, checking for blocked points at each step.
- **Output**: Ensure the correct distance is output for each person, or -1 if they walk indefinitely.

This solution should now correctly handle the constraints and provide the expected output for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem involves simulating the movement of people along a number line with roadworks blocking certain points at specific times. The key challenge is efficiently determining when each person will encounter a blocked point or if they will walk indefinitely.

#### Strategies and Challenges
1. **Event-Driven Simulation**: The initial approach was to create events for the start and end of each roadwork and sort them by time. This allows us to efficiently manage which points are blocked at any given time.

2. **Simulating Movement**: The main challenge was correctly simulating each person's movement and checking for blocked points. The logic needed to ensure that each person moves one unit per time unit and stops if they encounter a blocked point.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Ensuring that the simulation correctly handles cases where a person starts walking after a roadwork has ended or when multiple roadworks affect the same point at different times.

#### Errors and Fixes
- **Incorrect Condition for Movement**: The condition for moving to the next event time was flawed, leading to incorrect simulation of movement. The fix involved ensuring that the person only moves if the next position is not blocked.
  
- **Infinite Loop**: The simulation loop needed careful handling to avoid infinite loops, especially when processing events and updating the current position and time.

#### Lessons Learned
- **Event Sorting and Processing**: Sorting events by time and processing them in order is crucial for efficiently managing dynamic conditions like roadworks.
  
- **Simulation Accuracy**: Ensuring accurate simulation of movement and conditions requires careful attention to the logic for updating positions and checking conditions.

This problem reinforced the importance of event-driven simulation and careful condition checking in problems involving dynamic constraints and movement.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a street represented as a number line running from west to east. There are N roadworks scheduled, each blocking a specific point on the line for a given time interval. Q people start walking from coordinate 0 at different times, each moving at a speed of 1 unit per time unit. Each person stops walking when they reach a blocked point. We need to determine the distance each person will walk.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: First, read the number of roadworks (N) and the number of people (Q). Then, read the details of each roadwork and the start times for each person.

2. **Event Creation**: For each roadwork, create two events: one for the start of the blocking and one for the end. These events will help us track when a point becomes blocked and unblocked.

3. **Event Sorting**: Sort all events by time. If two events have the same time, prioritize the start of a blocking over the end of a blocking.

4. **Simulate Walking**: For each person, simulate their walk:
   - Use a pointer to track the current event.
   - Move the person forward in time and position until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

5. **Output**: For each person, output the distance they walked or -1 if they walked indefinitely.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_distances(N, Q, roadworks, start_times):
    events = []
    for each roadwork (S_i, T_i, X_i):
        add event (S_i - 0.5, 'start', X_i) to events
        add event (T_i - 0.5, 'end', X_i) to events
    
    sort events by time, with 'start' before 'end' if times are equal
    
    blocked_points = set()
    results = []
    event_index = 0
    
    for each start_time in start_times:
        current_time = start_time
        current_position = 0
        
        while event_index < len(events) and events[event_index].time <= current_time:
            event = events[event_index]
            if event.type == 'start':
                blocked_points.add(event.position)
            else:
                blocked_points.remove(event.position)
            event_index += 1
        
        while current_position not in blocked_points:
            if event_index >= len(events):
                results.append(-1)
                break
            next_event_time = events[event_index].time
            if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time:
                current_position += next_event_time - current_time
                current_time = next_event_time
            else:
                current_position += 1
                current_time += 1
        
        if current_position in blocked_points:
            results.append(current_position)
    
    return results
```

    index += 1

# Calculate distances

```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by using event-driven simulation and set operations to track blocked points.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code correctly creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition `if current_time + (next_event_time - current_time) <= next_event_time` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true. This condition should instead check if the person can move to the next event time without encountering a blocked point.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

Let's implement these corrections in the code.

### Key Fixes:
- **Event Processing**: Ensure that events are processed correctly up to the current time for each person.
- **Movement Simulation**: Correctly simulate the movement of each person, checking for blocked points at each step.
- **Output**: Ensure the correct distance is output for each person, or -1 if they walk indefinitely.

This solution should now correctly handle the constraints and provide the expected output for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues that could lead to runtime errors or inefficiencies:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Event Creation**: The code creates events for the start and end of each roadwork. Each event is represented as a tuple `(time, type, position)`.

2. **Event Sorting**: The events are sorted by time, with 'start' events prioritized over 'end' events if they occur at the same time. This is done using the sorting key `(x[0], x[1] == 'end')`.

3. **Blocked Points Management**: A set `blocked_points` is used to track which points are currently blocked. This set is updated as events are processed.

4. **Simulating Each Person's Walk**:
   - For each person, the code processes all events up to the current time.
   - The person moves forward until they reach a blocked point or there are no more events.
   - If they reach a blocked point, the distance is recorded. If they never reach a blocked point, -1 is recorded.

### Potential Issues

- **Event Processing Logic**: The logic for processing events and moving the person might be flawed. Specifically, the condition for moving the person to the next event time might not correctly simulate the person's movement.

- **Time and Position Update**: The logic for updating the current position and time might not correctly simulate the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

- **Infinite Loop or Inefficiency**: The while loop that simulates the person's movement might not terminate correctly if the logic for checking blocked points is incorrect.

### Where I Went Wrong

- **Incorrect Condition**: The condition for moving the person to the next event time is incorrect. It should check if the person can move to the next event time without hitting a blocked point.

- **Position Update Logic**: The logic for updating the position and time is not correctly simulating the person's movement. The person should move one unit per time unit, and the code should check if the next position is blocked before moving.

### Revised Plan

1. **Event Processing**: Process events up to the current time for each person.
2. **Simulate Movement**: Move the person one unit per time unit, checking if the next position is blocked.
3. **Check for Blocked Points**: If the person reaches a blocked point, record the distance. If they never reach a blocked point, record -1.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:

### Key Insights from the Official Solution

1. **Event-Driven Approach**: The official solution uses an event-driven approach, which is efficient for handling time-based changes. Events are created for the start and end of each roadwork, as well as for each person's start time. This allows the solution to process changes in the state of the road in a chronological order.

2. **Use of Priority Queue**: A priority queue (min-heap) is used to efficiently track the nearest blocked point for each person. This is crucial because it allows the solution to quickly determine the first blocked point a person will encounter as they walk.

3. **Efficient State Management**: The solution maintains a dictionary `isClosed` to track whether a point is currently blocked. This is updated as events are processed, ensuring that the priority queue only contains active blockages.

4. **Handling Queries**: By sorting all events together (including the queries), the solution can handle each person's query in the context of the current state of the road. This ensures that each query is answered with the most up-to-date information about road blockages.

### Why My Approach Failed

- **Complexity in Movement Simulation**: My approach attempted to simulate each person's movement step-by-step, which was inefficient and prone to errors, especially with large input sizes. The official solution avoids this by using a priority queue to directly determine the nearest blockage.

- **Inefficient Event Processing**: My solution did not efficiently handle the transition between events, leading to potential infinite loops or incorrect state management. The official solution's use of a sorted event list and priority queue ensures that all state changes are handled efficiently and correctly.

### Lessons Learned

- **Event-Driven Design**: For problems involving time-based changes, an event-driven approach can simplify the logic and improve efficiency.
- **Priority Queues for Nearest Queries**: When needing to find the nearest or smallest element repeatedly, a priority queue is a powerful tool.
- **Efficient State Tracking**: Maintaining a clear and efficient way to track the state of the system (e.g., which points are blocked) is crucial for correctness and performance.

These insights highlight the importance of choosing the right data structures and algorithms to match the problem's requirements, especially under constraints of large input sizes.
