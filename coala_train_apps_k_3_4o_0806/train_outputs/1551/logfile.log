INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given quote is "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy". A quote is considered "Real Fancy" if it contains the word "not" as a standalone word. If "not" is not present as a standalone word, the quote is "regularly fancy". We will be given multiple quotes to evaluate.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each quote, we need to check if the word "not" appears as a standalone word.
2. A standalone word means it is surrounded by spaces or is at the beginning or end of the string.
3. We will split each quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words.
4. If "not" is found, the quote is "Real Fancy". Otherwise, it is "regularly fancy".

## Pseudocode

```
function classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for each quote in quotes:
        split the quote into words
        if "not" is in the list of words:
            print "Real Fancy"
        else:
            print "regularly fancy"

read T from input
initialize an empty list for quotes
for i from 1 to T:
    read a quote and append to quotes list

call classify_quotes with T and quotes
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate over each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is a standalone word in the list
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
# Initialize a list to store the quotes
quotes = []
# Read each quote
for _ in range(T):
    quote = input().strip()
    quotes.append(quote)

# Classify each quote
classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and each quote, then checks if "not" is a standalone word in each quote. It prints "Real Fancy" if "not" is found, otherwise "regularly fancy".

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

    [Task]:
        Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
        - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
        - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
        - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
        He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
        You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where i≤j$i \leq j$.
        For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
        c
        co
        cod
        code
        codec
        codeco

        -----Input:-----
        - The first line contains string S$S$ — consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - The second line contains string T$T$ — consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ — the number of queries.
        - Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

        -----Output:-----
        - Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We have a string `S` and we form a pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. The characters in each row are formed by repeating the string `S` in a cyclic manner. We are given another string `T` and need to answer `Q` queries. Each query provides a row number `N`, and we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Pyramid**: 
           - The `N`-th row of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string `S` until it reaches a length of `N`.
           - This means the `N`-th row is `S` repeated `N // len(S)` times plus the first `N % len(S)` characters of `S`.

        2. **Finding Substring Occurrences**:
           - For each query, construct the `N`-th row as described.
           - Count the number of times `T` appears as a substring in this row.

        3. **Efficiency Considerations**:
           - Directly constructing the `N`-th row for very large `N` is inefficient.
           - Instead, use the properties of cyclic repetition to determine the row content without explicitly constructing it.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
            results = []
            len_s = length of S
            len_t = length of T

            for each query N in queries:
                # Calculate the effective row
                full_repeats = N // len_s
                remainder = N % len_s

                # Construct the row
                row = S * full_repeats + S[:remainder]

                # Count occurrences of T in the row
                count = 0
                for i from 0 to length of row - len_t:
                    if row[i:i+len_t] == T:
                        count += 1

                results.append(count)

            return results
        ```

        ### Final Python Code

        ```python
        def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
            results = []
            len_s = len(S)
            len_t = len(T)

            for N in queries:
                # Calculate the effective row
                full_repeats = N // len_s
                remainder = N % len_s

                # Construct the row
                row = S * full_repeats + S[:remainder]

                # Count occurrences of T in the row
                count = 0
                for i in range(len(row) - len_t + 1):
                    if row[i:i+len_t] == T:
                        count += 1

                results.append(count)

            return results

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            S = data[0]
            T = data[1]
            Q = int(data[2])
            queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]
    
            results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Row Construction**: For each query, we determine how many full repetitions of `S` fit into the row and how many additional characters are needed.
        - **Substring Search**: We then search for `T` in this constructed row.
        - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the construction of the row and the search for `T` by leveraging Python's string slicing and comparison operations.

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `remove_abc_pairs()` was defined but never called. In Python, simply defining a function does not execute it; it must be explicitly called to run.

        ### Steps to Correct the Code

        1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the function `remove_abc_pairs()` is called after its definition so that it executes and processes the input.
        2. **Standard Input/Output**: Verify that the function correctly reads from standard input and writes to standard output, as required by the problem statement.

        ### Revised Solution

        To fix the issue, we need to call the function after defining it. Here's the corrected code:

        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                s = data[i]
                while 'abc' in s:
                    s = s.replace('abc', '', 1)
                results.append(s)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the function to execute it
        remove_abc_pairs()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Correction

        - **Function Call**: The function `remove_abc_pairs()` is now called at the end of the script. This ensures that the function is executed when the script runs.
        - **Input Handling**: The function reads input using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments where input is provided all at once.
        - **Output Handling**: The function prints each result line by line, which matches the expected output format. 

        This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the given test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to classify quotes based on whether they contain the word "not" as a standalone word. If a quote contains "not" as a separate word, it is classified as "Real Fancy". Otherwise, it is classified as "regularly fancy". We are given multiple quotes and need to determine the classification for each.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases, T. For each test case, read the quote string S.
2. **Word Detection**: For each quote, split the string into words and check if "not" is present as a standalone word.
3. **Classification**: If "not" is found, classify the quote as "Real Fancy". Otherwise, classify it as "regularly fancy".
4. **Output**: For each quote, output the classification result.

## Pseudocode

```
function classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for each quote in quotes:
        split the quote into words
        if "not" is in the list of words:
            print "Real Fancy"
        else:
            print "regularly fancy"

function main():
    read integer T
    initialize an empty list quotes
    for i from 1 to T:
        read a quote and append to quotes
    classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

## Final Python Code

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is a standalone word in the list
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once and split it into lines. The first line gives us the number of test cases, T. The subsequent lines contain the quotes.
- **Word Splitting**: For each quote, we split the string into words using the `split()` method, which handles spaces and returns a list of words.
- **Classification**: We check if "not" is in the list of words. If it is, we print "Real Fancy". Otherwise, we print "regularly fancy".
- **Output**: The results are printed directly for each quote.

  print("Real Fancy")
 else:
  print("regularly fancy")
 t=t-1

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the task of classifying quotes based on the presence of the word "not" as a standalone word. The key insight is to split each quote into words and check for the presence of "not" in the resulting list.

### Key Insights:
- **Word Splitting**: Both solutions use the `split()` method to break the quote into words. This is crucial because it ensures that "not" is checked as a standalone word, not as a substring of another word.
- **Condition Check**: The presence of "not" in the list of words is checked using the `in` keyword, which is efficient and straightforward for this task.

### Differences:
- **Input Handling**: My solution reads all input at once and processes it, while the official solution uses a loop to read each quote individually. Both methods are valid, but reading all input at once can be more efficient in some contexts.
- **Loop Structure**: The official solution uses a `while` loop to iterate over the test cases, decrementing the counter manually. My solution uses a `for` loop, which is generally more idiomatic in Python for iterating over a fixed number of items.

Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions are efficient given the constraints. The main takeaway is the importance of correctly splitting the input string to ensure accurate word detection.

The main function is `main`.
INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] The function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases, and the following T lines each contain a quote. It then calls another function to classify each quote based on whether the word "not" appears as a standalone word within the quote. If "not" is found, it prints "Real Fancy"; otherwise, it prints "regularly fancy". The function processes all quotes in sequence and outputs the classification for each one.

You are a helpful assistant that extracts important information from problems and solutions to aid in searchability and education.

## Instructions
- Read through the problem and solution carefully.
- Reason out, step by step, in what scenarios this knowledge would be useful.
- Focus on general patterns and situations to help connect this knowledge to new situations.
- Then, include a list of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair.

## Response format
Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"scenarios": {"description": "In what scenarios will this knowledge be useful? Answer in a paragraph.", "title": "Scenarios", "type": "string"}, "keywords": {"description": "List of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Keywords", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["scenarios", "keywords"]}

[Problem]
    "I don't have any fancy quotes." - vijju123
    Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
    You are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 50$
    - $1 \le |S| \le 100$
    - each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

    -----Example Input-----
    2
    i do not have any fancy quotes
    when nothing goes right go left

    -----Example Output-----
    Real Fancy
    regularly fancy

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1: "i do not have any fancy quotes"
    Example case 2: The word "not" does not appear in the given quote.
