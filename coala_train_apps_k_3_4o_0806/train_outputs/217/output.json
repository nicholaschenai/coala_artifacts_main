    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given an array `A` of non-negative integers. For every contiguous subarray `B` of `A`, we compute the bitwise OR of all elements in `B`. Our task is to return the number of unique results obtained from these bitwise OR operations.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number that has bits set to 1 wherever either of the original numbers had a bit set to 1. This means that the result of a bitwise OR operation can only increase or stay the same as we include more numbers in the subarray.\n\n2. **Tracking Unique Results**: We need to track all unique results of the bitwise OR operations. Using a set is ideal for this purpose because it automatically handles duplicates.\n\n3. **Iterative Approach**: \n   - For each element in the array, consider it as the starting point of a subarray.\n   - Compute the bitwise OR for all subarrays starting from this element.\n   - Use a set to keep track of all unique results.\n\n4. **Optimization Insight**: \n   - If we have a result from a subarray ending at a certain index, extending this subarray by one more element can only add more bits (or keep the same) to the result. Thus, we can build on previous results to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a set `unique_results` to store unique OR results.\n2. For each element `A[i]` in the array:\n   - Initialize a set `current_results` to store OR results for subarrays starting at `A[i]`.\n   - Add `A[i]` to `current_results`.\n   - For each result in `current_results`, compute the OR with `A[i]` and update `current_results`.\n   - Add all results from `current_results` to `unique_results`.\n3. Return the size of `unique_results`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Set to store all unique OR results\n        unique_results = set()\n        \n        # Set to store current OR results for subarrays ending at the current index\n        current_results = set()\n        \n        for num in A:\n            # Update current results with the new number\n            # Start a new set of results for the current number\n            new_results = {num}\n            \n            # Extend each of the previous results with the current number\n            for result in current_results:\n                new_results.add(result | num)\n            \n            # Update the current results\n            current_results = new_results\n            \n            # Add all current results to the unique results\n            unique_results.update(current_results)\n        \n        # The number of unique results is the answer\n        return len(unique_results)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We maintain a set `unique_results` to store all unique OR results.\n- For each number in the array, we compute new OR results by extending the previous results (`current_results`) with the current number.\n- We update `current_results` with these new results and add them to `unique_results`.\n- Finally, the size of `unique_results` gives us the number of unique OR results.",
