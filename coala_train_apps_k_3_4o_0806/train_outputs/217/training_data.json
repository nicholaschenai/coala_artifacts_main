    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to find the number of unique results from bitwise OR operations on all contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The core concept here is understanding how the bitwise OR operation works and how it can be efficiently computed over subarrays.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Bitwise OR**: This operation results in a number that has bits set to 1 wherever either of the original numbers had a bit set to 1. This means that as we extend a subarray, the OR result can only increase or stay the same.\n- **Set for Uniqueness**: Using a set to track unique OR results is crucial because it automatically handles duplicates, which is essential for counting unique results.\n\n### Strategy:\n- For each element in the array, consider it as the starting point of a subarray.\n- Use a set to store OR results for subarrays ending at the current index.\n- Extend previous results by including the current element and update the set of results.\n- Add these results to a global set that tracks all unique OR results.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n        unique_results = set()\n        current_results = set()\n        \n        for num in A:\n            new_results = {num}\n            for result in current_results:\n                new_results.add(result | num)\n            current_results = new_results\n            unique_results.update(current_results)\n        \n        return len(unique_results)\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to manage uniqueness. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency.",
    "reflection": "The problem of finding the number of unique bitwise OR results from all contiguous subarrays of a given array was an interesting challenge. My initial approach was quite similar to the official solution, but there are some key insights and optimizations in the official solution that are worth noting.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Efficient Use of Sets**: The official solution uses set comprehensions to efficiently compute the new OR results for each element in the array. This is both concise and efficient, as it leverages Python's set operations to handle duplicates and update results seamlessly.\n\n2. **Iterative Update of Results**: Instead of maintaining a separate `new_results` set as in my initial approach, the official solution directly updates the `cur` set with the new OR results. This reduces the overhead of managing multiple sets and simplifies the logic.\n\n3. **Union Operations**: The use of the union operation (`|=`) to combine results into the `res` set is a neat way to ensure all unique results are captured without needing explicit loops or additional checks.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution is a more elegant and concise version of my initial approach. It effectively uses Python's set operations to manage and update results, which not only simplifies the code but also potentially improves performance by reducing the number of operations needed to manage intermediate results. This experience reinforces the importance of leveraging language-specific features, such as set comprehensions and union operations, to write cleaner and more efficient code.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThe function calculates the number of distinct bitwise OR results that can be obtained from all possible subarrays of a given list of integers. It uses a set to keep track of unique OR results and another set to store the OR results of subarrays ending at the current index. For each number in the list, it updates the current results by performing a bitwise OR with the new number and all previous results, then adds these to the set of unique results. The function returns the size of the set containing all unique OR results, which represents the number of distinct OR values from all subarrays.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the number of unique results from bitwise operations over subarrays of an array. This can be applied in problems involving bitwise operations, such as optimizing network protocols, data compression, or cryptography, where understanding the diversity of outcomes from operations on data segments is crucial. It is also relevant in competitive programming and algorithm design, where efficient handling of subarray operations is required, especially given constraints on array size and element values."
