INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a list of strings, and we need to find the shortest string that contains each of the given strings as a substring. Importantly, no string in the list is a substring of another string in the list. The order of the strings in the final result does not matter as long as all strings are included as substrings.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Overlap**: For each pair of strings, determine the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of another. This overlap will help in minimizing the length of the final superstring.

2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each string is a node. The edge weight between two nodes (strings) is the overlap length. The goal is to find a path that visits all nodes (strings) and minimizes the total length of the superstring.

3. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking**: Use dynamic programming to explore all possible combinations of strings. Use a bitmask to represent the set of strings included in the current superstring. For each state, keep track of the last string added to the superstring and the current length of the superstring.

4. **Reconstruct the Solution**: Once the optimal path is found using dynamic programming, reconstruct the superstring by backtracking through the states.

## Pseudocode

1. **Calculate Overlaps**:
   - For each pair of strings `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of `A[i]` matches the prefix of `A[j]`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Let `dp[mask][i]` be the minimum length of a superstring that contains the set of strings represented by `mask` and ends with the string `A[i]`.
   - Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` to the length of `A[i]` for each string `i`.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each `mask` and each string `i` in `mask`, try to extend the superstring by adding another string `j` not in `mask`.
   - Update `dp[mask | (1 << j)][j]` using the overlap between `A[i]` and `A[j]`.

4. **Reconstruct the Superstring**:
   - Start from the state with all strings included and backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the reconstructed superstring.

## Final Python Solution

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:
        n = len(A)

            for j in range(n):
                if i != j:
                    overlap[i][j] = calculate_overlap(A[i], A[j])
        
        # dp[mask][i] will store the minimum length of superstring ending with A[i]
        dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]
        parent = [[-1] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]
        
        # Initialize the dp array
        for i in range(n):
            dp[1 << i][i] = len(A[i])

        for mask in range(1 << n):
            for i in range(n):
                if mask & (1 << i) == 0:

                for j in range(n):
                    if mask & (1 << j) != 0:
                        continue
                    new_mask = mask | (1 << j)
                    new_length = dp[mask][i] + len(A[j]) - overlap[i][j]
                    if new_length < dp[new_mask][j]:
                        dp[new_mask][j] = new_length
                        parent[new_mask][j] = i
        
        # Find the minimum length superstring
        min_length = float('inf')
        last = -1
        final_mask = (1 << n) - 1
        for i in range(n):
            if dp[final_mask][i] < min_length:
                min_length = dp[final_mask][i]
                last = i
        
        # Reconstruct the shortest superstring
        mask = final_mask
        order = []
        while last != -1:
            order.append(last)
            next_last = parent[mask][last]
            mask ^= (1 << last)
            last = next_last
        
        order.reverse()
        
        # Build the final superstring
        superstring = A[order[0]]
        for k in range(1, len(order)):
            i, j = order[k-1], order[k]
            superstring += A[j][overlap[i][j]:]
        
        return superstring
```

This solution uses dynamic programming with bitmasking to efficiently find the shortest superstring that contains all the given strings as substrings.

    ### Shortest non-appearing string

    Given a string $S$ and a certain alphabet.
    We have to find a string of smallest length, that doesn't appear in $S$.

    We will apply dynamic programming on the suffix automaton built for the string $S$.

    Let $d[v]$ be the answer for the node $v$, i.e. we already processed part of the substring, are currently in the state $v$, and want to find the smallest number of characters that have to be added to find a non-existent transition.
    Computing $d[v]$ is very simple.
    If there is not transition using at least one character of the alphabet, then $d[v] = 1$.
    Otherwise one character is not enough, and so we need to take the minimum of all answers of all transitions:

    $$d[v] = 1 + \min_{w:(v,w,c) \in SA} d[w].$$

    The answer to the problem will be $d[t_0]$, and the actual string can be restored using the computed array $d[]$.

    ### Longest common substring of two strings

    Given two strings $S$ and $T$.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in $S$ and also in $T$.

    We construct a suffix automaton for the string $S$.

    We will now take the string $T$, and for each prefix look for the longest suffix of this prefix in $S$.
    In other words, for each position in the string $T$, we want to find the longest common substring of $S$ and $T$ ending in that position.

    For this we will use two variables, the **current state** $v$, and the **current length** $l$.
    These two variables will describe the current matching part: its length and the state that corresponds to it.

    Initially $v = t_0$ and $l = 0$, i.e. the match is empty.

    Now let us describe how we can add a character $T[i]$ and recalculate the answer for it.

      - If there is a transition from $v$ with the character $T[i]$, then we simply follow the transition and increase $l$ by one.
      - If there is no such transition, we have to shorten the current matching part, which means that we need to follow the suffix link: $v = link(v)$.
        At the same time, the current length has to be shortened.
        Obviously we need to assign $l = len(v)$, since after passing through the suffix link we end up in state whose corresponding longest string is a substring.
      - If there is still no transition using the required character, we repeat and again go through the suffix link and decrease $l$, until we find a transition or we reach the fictional state $-1$ (which means that the symbol $T[i]$ doesn't appear at all in $S$, so we assign $v = l = 0$).

    The answer to the task will be the maximum of all the values $l$.

    The complexity of this part is $O(length(T))$, since in one move we can either increase $l$ by one, or make several passes through the suffix links, each one ends up reducing the value $l$.

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    string lcs (string S, string T) {
        sa_init();
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++)
            sa_extend(S[i]);
 
        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {
            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st[v].link ;
                l = st[v].len;
            }
            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st [v].next[T[i]];
                l++;
            }
            if (l > best) {
                best = l;
                bestpos = i;
            }
        }
        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);
    } 
    ```

    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings

    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.

    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):

    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \dots + S_k + D_k.$$

    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.

    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.
    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \dots, D_k$.

    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.
    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.
    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.

[Reflection]:
    The problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after smashing them together is essentially a partition problem. The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. My initial approach used a dynamic programming array to track possible sums, which is a common technique for partition problems.

    The official solution, however, uses a set to track possible sums, which is a more elegant and concise approach. Here's a breakdown of the official solution:

    1. **Initialization**: Start with a set `dp` containing only the sum `0`. This set will be used to track all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones.

    2. **Iterate through stones**: For each stone, update the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in `dp`. This is done using set comprehension, which efficiently updates the set with new possible sums.

    3. **Calculate the result**: After processing all stones, the set `dp` contains all possible sums. The goal is to find the sum that, when doubled and subtracted from the total weight, gives the smallest possible result. This is achieved by iterating through the set and calculating the minimum of `abs(total - 2 * _sum)` for each `_sum` in `dp`.

    The official solution is insightful because it leverages Python's set operations to efficiently manage and update possible sums, resulting in a more concise and potentially faster implementation compared to the traditional dynamic programming array approach. This solution is particularly elegant in its use of set comprehension to handle the sum updates in a single line, making the code both compact and easy to understand.

    ### Lexicographically $k$-th substring {data-toc-label="Lexicographically k-th substring"}

    Given a string $S$.
    We have to answer multiple queries.
    For each given number $K_i$ we have to find the $K_i$-th string in the lexicographically ordered list of all substrings.

    The solution of this problem is based on the idea of the previous two problems.
    The lexicographically $k$-th substring corresponds to the lexicographically $k$-th path in the suffix automaton.
    Therefore after counting the number of paths from each state, we can easily search for the $k$-th path starting from the root of the automaton.

    This takes $O(length(S))$ time for preprocessing and then $O(length(ans) \cdot k)$ for each query (where $ans$ is the answer for the query and $k$ is the size of the alphabet).

    ### Smallest cyclic shift

    Given a string $S$.
    We want to find the lexicographically smallest cyclic shift.

    We construct a suffix automaton for the string $S + S$.
    Then the automaton will contain in itself as paths all the cyclic shifts of the string $S$.

    Consequently the problem is reduced to finding the lexicographically smallest path of length $length(S)$, which can be done in a trivial way: we start in the initial state and greedily pass through the transitions with the minimal character.

    Total time complexity is $O(length(S))$.

    ### Number of occurrences

    For a given text $T$.
    We have to answer multiple queries.
    For each given pattern $P$ we have to find out how many times the string $P$ appears in the string $T$ as substring.

    We construct the suffix automaton for the text $T$.

    Next we do the following preprocessing:
    for each state $v$ in the automaton we calculate the number $cnt[v]$ that is equal to the size of the set $endpos(v)$.
    In fact all strings corresponding to the same state $v$ appear in the text $T$ an equal amount of times, which is equal to the number of positions in the set $endpos$.

    However we cannot construct the sets $endpos$ explicitly, therefore we only consider their sizes $cnt$.

    To compute them we proceed as follows.
    For each state, if it was not created by cloning (and if it is not the initial state $t_0$), we initialize it with $cnt = 1$.
    Then we will go through all states in decreasing order of their length $len$, and add the current value $cnt[v]$ to the suffix links:

    $$cnt[link(v)] \text{ += } cnt[v]$$

    This gives the correct value for each state.

    Why is this correct?
    The total number of states obtained _not_ via cloning is exactly $length(T)$, and the first $i$ of them appeared when we added the first $i$ characters.
    Consequently for each of these states we count the corresponding position at which it was processed.
    Therefore initially we have $cnt = 1$ for each such state, and $cnt = 0$ for all other.

    Then we apply the following operation for each $v$: $cnt[link(v)] \text{ += } cnt[v]$.
    The meaning behind this is, that if a string $v$ appears $cnt[v]$ times, then also all its suffixes appear at the exact same end positions, therefore also $cnt[v]$ times.

    Why don't we overcount in this procedure (i.e. don't count some position twice)?
    Because we add the positions of a state to only one other state, so it can not happen that one state directs its positions to another state twice in two different ways.

    Thus we can compute the quantities $cnt$ for all states in the automaton in $O(length(T))$ time.

    After that answering a query by just looking up the value $cnt[t]$, where $t$ is the state corresponding to the pattern, if such a state exists.
    Otherwise answer with $0$.
    Answering a query takes $O(length(P))$ time.

    ### First occurrence position

    Given a text $T$ and multiple queries.
    For each query string $P$ we want to find the position of the first occurrence of $P$ in the string $T$ (the position of the beginning of $P$).

    We again construct a suffix automaton.
    Additionally we precompute the position $firstpos$ for all states in the automaton, i.e. for each state $v$ we want to find the position $firstpos[v]$ of the end of the first occurrence.
    In other words, we want to find in advance the minimal element of each set $endpos$ (since obviously cannot maintain all sets $endpos$ explicitly).

    To maintain these positions $firstpos$ we extend the function `sa_extend()`.
    When we create a new state $cur$, we set:

    $$firstpos(cur) = len(cur) - 1$$

    And when we clone a vertex $q$ as $clone$, we set:

    $$firstpos(clone) = firstpos(q)$$

    (since the only other option for a value would be $firstpos(cur)$ which is definitely too big)

    Thus the answer for a query is simply $firstpos(t) - length(P) + 1$, where $t$ is the state corresponding to the string $P$.
    Answering a query again takes only $O(length(P))$ time.

    ### All occurrence positions

    This time we have to display all positions of the occurrences in the string $T$.

    Again we construct a suffix automaton for the text $T$.
    Similar as in the previous task we compute the position $firstpos$ for all states.

    Clearly $firstpos(t)$ is part of the answer, if $t$ is the state corresponding to a query string $P$.
    So we took into account the state of the automaton containing $P$.
    What other states do we need to take into account?
    All states that correspond to strings for which $P$ is a suffix.
    In other words we need to find all the states that can reach the state $t$ via suffix links.

    Therefore to solve the problem we need to save for each state a list of suffix references leading to it.
    The answer to the query then will then contain all $firstpos$ for each state that we can find on a DFS / BFS starting from the state $t$ using only the suffix references.

    This workaround will work in time $O(answer(P))$, because we will not visit a state twice (because only one suffix link leaves each state, so there cannot be two different paths leading to the same state).

    We only must take into account that two different states can have the same $firstpos$ value.
    This happens if one state was obtained by cloning another.
    However, this doesn't ruin the complexity, since each state can only have at most one clone.

    Moreover, we can also get rid of the duplicate positions, if we don't output the positions from the cloned states.
    In fact a state, that a cloned state can reach, is also reachable from the original state.
    Thus if we remember the flag `is_cloned` for each state, we can simply ignore the cloned states and only output $firstpos$ for all other states.

    Here are some implementation sketches:

    ```cpp
    struct state {
        ...
        bool is_clone;
        int first_pos;
        vector<int> inv_link;
    };

    // after constructing the automaton
    for (int v = 1; v < sz; v++) {
        st[st[v].link].inv_link.push_back(v);
    }

    // output all positions of occurrences
    void output_all_occurrences(int v, int P_length) {
        if (!st[v].is_clone)
            cout << st[v].first_pos - P_length + 1 << endl;
        for (int u : st[v].inv_link)
            output_all_occurrences(u, P_length);
    }

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given an array of strings, and we need to find the smallest string that contains each string in the array as a substring. No string in the array is a substring of another string in the array.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to construct a superstring that contains all the given strings as substrings. The challenge is to minimize the length of this superstring. The key idea is to overlap the strings as much as possible. 

1. **Overlap Calculation**: For any two strings, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of the other string.

2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each string is a node. The edge weight between two nodes is the overlap length.

3. **Find Optimal Path**: Use a dynamic programming approach to find the path that maximizes the total overlap, which will minimize the length of the resulting superstring.

4. **Construct Superstring**: Once the optimal path is found, construct the superstring by concatenating the strings according to the path, using the calculated overlaps to avoid redundancy.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `calculate_overlap(s1, s2)` that returns the maximum overlap length where the suffix of `s1` matches the prefix of `s2`.

2. Create a 2D list `overlap` where `overlap[i][j]` stores the overlap length between `A[i]` and `A[j]`.

3. Use dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring:
   - Define `dp[mask][i]` as the length of the shortest superstring that contains the strings represented by `mask` and ends with `A[i]`.
   - Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` to the length of `A[i]` for all `i`.
   - For each `mask` and each `i`, update `dp[mask][i]` by considering all possible previous strings `j` that could lead to `i`.

4. Reconstruct the path that gives the shortest superstring using the `dp` table.

5. Construct the final superstring by concatenating the strings according to the path, using the overlaps to avoid redundancy.

```

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the shortest superstring by maximizing the overlap between strings. The `calculate_overlap` function computes the maximum overlap between two strings, which is used to build the `overlap` matrix. The `dp` table is then used to find the optimal path that results in the shortest superstring.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given an array of strings, and we need to find the smallest string that contains each string in the array as a substring. No string in the array is a substring of another string in the array.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to construct a superstring that contains all the given strings as substrings. The challenge is to minimize the length of this superstring. The key idea is to overlap the strings as much as possible. 

1. **Overlap Calculation**: For any two strings, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of the other string.

2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each string is a node. The edge weight between two nodes is the overlap length.

3. **Find Optimal Path**: Use a dynamic programming approach to find the path that maximizes the total overlap, which will minimize the length of the resulting superstring.

4. **Construct Superstring**: Once the optimal path is found, construct the superstring by concatenating the strings according to the path, using the calculated overlaps to avoid redundancy.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `calculate_overlap(s1, s2)` that returns the maximum overlap length where the suffix of `s1` matches the prefix of `s2`.

2. Create a 2D list `overlap` where `overlap[i][j]` stores the overlap length between `A[i]` and `A[j]`.

3. Use dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring:
   - Define `dp[mask][i]` as the length of the shortest superstring that contains the strings represented by `mask` and ends with `A[i]`.
   - Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` to the length of `A[i]` for all `i`.
   - For each `mask` and each `i`, update `dp[mask][i]` by considering all possible previous strings `j` that could lead to `i`.

4. Reconstruct the path that gives the shortest superstring using the `dp` table.

5. Construct the final superstring by concatenating the strings according to the path, using the overlaps to avoid redundancy.

### Final Python Solution

    def calculate_overlap(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
        max_overlap = 0

        parent = [[-1] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]
        
        # Initialize dp for single strings

                    new_mask = mask | (1 << j)
                    new_length = dp[mask][i] + len(A[j]) - overlap[i][j]
                    if new_length < dp[new_mask][j]:
                        dp[new_mask][j] = new_length
                        parent[new_mask][j] = i
        
        # Find the end of the shortest superstring
        min_length = float('inf')
        last = -1
        final_mask = (1 << n) - 1
        for i in range(n):
            if dp[final_mask][i] < min_length:
                min_length = dp[final_mask][i]
                last = i
        
        # Reconstruct the shortest superstring
        mask = final_mask
        path = []
        while last != -1:
            path.append(last)
            next_last = parent[mask][last]
            mask ^= (1 << last)
            last = next_last
        
        path.reverse()
        
        # Build the superstring using the path
        superstring = A[path[0]]
        for k in range(1, len(path)):
            i, j = path[k-1], path[k]
            superstring += A[j][overlap[i][j]:]
        
        return superstring
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the shortest superstring by maximizing the overlap between strings. The `calculate_overlap` function computes the maximum overlap between two strings, which is used to build the `overlap` matrix. The `dp` table is then used to find the optimal path that results in the shortest superstring.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the shortest superstring that contains each string from a given list as a substring. The key challenge was to minimize the length of the superstring by maximizing the overlap between consecutive strings.

### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem primarily tested the ability to use dynamic programming to solve a combinatorial optimization problem. The core concept was to represent the problem as a graph where nodes are strings and edges represent the overlap between them. The task was to find a path through this graph that maximizes the total overlap, thereby minimizing the superstring length.

### Strategies
The successful strategy involved:
1. **Overlap Calculation**: Calculating the maximum overlap between every pair of strings.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Using a DP table to keep track of the shortest superstring length for each combination of strings, ending with a specific string.
3. **Path Reconstruction**: Backtracking through the DP table to reconstruct the path that gives the shortest superstring.

### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
Initially, there was a misunderstanding in the input format, which led to incorrect parsing of strings. The input strings were wrapped in additional quotes, which needed to be handled correctly. Once the input was correctly parsed, the solution worked as expected.

### Code Snippet
The core of the solution involved calculating overlaps and using a DP table to find the optimal path:

```python
def calculate_overlap(s1, s2):
    max_overlap = 0
    for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):
        if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:
            max_overlap = i
    return max_overlap

# Dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring
dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]
parent = [[-1] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]

# Initialize dp for single strings
for i in range(n):
    dp[1 << i][i] = len(A[i])

# Fill dp table
for mask in range(1 << n):
    for i in range(n):
        if not (mask & (1 << i)):
            continue
        for j in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << j):
                continue
            new_mask = mask | (1 << j)
            new_length = dp[mask][i] + len(A[j]) - overlap[i][j]
            if new_length < dp[new_mask][j]:
                dp[new_mask][j] = new_length
                parent[new_mask][j] = i
```

This experience reinforced the importance of correctly parsing inputs and the effectiveness of dynamic programming in solving optimization problems involving permutations and combinations.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the shortest superstring that contains all given strings as substrings. The challenge is to maximize the overlap between strings to minimize the total length of the superstring.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach with memoization to efficiently compute the shortest superstring. The `memo` decorator is used to cache results of the recursive function `find_short`, which helps in avoiding redundant calculations and speeds up the process.

3. **Merge Function**: The `merge` function is crucial as it determines how two strings can be combined with maximum overlap. It checks for the longest suffix of the first string that matches the prefix of the second string and merges them accordingly.

4. **Recursive Approach**: The `find_short` function is a recursive function that attempts to build the shortest superstring by considering all possible orders of strings. It uses the `merge` function to combine strings and memoization to store intermediate results.

5. **Handling Substring Elimination**: The official solution starts by filtering out any strings that are substrings of others, which simplifies the problem and reduces unnecessary computations.

6. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient given the constraints, as it leverages memoization to handle the exponential number of possible string orderings. This is crucial for handling the maximum input size effectively.

In summary, the official solution is insightful in its use of dynamic programming and memoization to tackle the problem efficiently. The recursive approach combined with the `merge` function allows for a systematic exploration of all possible string combinations, ensuring the shortest superstring is found. This approach is both elegant and effective for the given problem constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] The function takes a list of strings and returns the shortest superstring that contains each string in the list as a substring. It first calculates the maximum overlap between each pair of strings and stores these values in a matrix. It then uses dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring by considering all possible combinations of strings and their overlaps. The function constructs a DP table where each entry represents the shortest superstring that can be formed with a specific set of strings ending with a particular string. After filling the DP table, it reconstructs the shortest superstring by backtracking through the table to determine the optimal order of strings. Finally, it builds the superstring by concatenating the strings in the determined order, using the precomputed overlaps to minimize the total length.

[Problem]
    Given an array A of strings, find anyÂ smallest string that contains each string in A as aÂ substring.
    We may assume that no string in A is substring of another string in A.
Â 

    Example 1:
    Input: ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
    Output: "alexlovesleetcode"
    Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.


    Example 2:
    Input: ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
    Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"
Â 


    Note:

    1 <= A.length <= 12
    1 <= A[i].length <= 20
