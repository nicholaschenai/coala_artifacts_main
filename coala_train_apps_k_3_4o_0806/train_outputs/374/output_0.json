    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given an array of strings, and we need to find the smallest string that contains each string in the array as a substring. No string in the array is a substring of another string in the array.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to construct a superstring that contains all the given strings as substrings. The challenge is to minimize the length of this superstring. The key idea is to overlap the strings as much as possible. \n\n1. **Overlap Calculation**: For any two strings, calculate the maximum overlap where the suffix of one string matches the prefix of the other string.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the problem as a graph where each string is a node. The edge weight between two nodes is the overlap length.\n\n3. **Find Optimal Path**: Use a dynamic programming approach to find the path that maximizes the total overlap, which will minimize the length of the resulting superstring.\n\n4. **Construct Superstring**: Once the optimal path is found, construct the superstring by concatenating the strings according to the path, using the calculated overlaps to avoid redundancy.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `calculate_overlap(s1, s2)` that returns the maximum overlap length where the suffix of `s1` matches the prefix of `s2`.\n\n2. Create a 2D list `overlap` where `overlap[i][j]` stores the overlap length between `A[i]` and `A[j]`.\n\n3. Use dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring:\n   - Define `dp[mask][i]` as the length of the shortest superstring that contains the strings represented by `mask` and ends with `A[i]`.\n   - Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` to the length of `A[i]` for all `i`.\n   - For each `mask` and each `i`, update `dp[mask][i]` by considering all possible previous strings `j` that could lead to `i`.\n\n4. Reconstruct the path that gives the shortest superstring using the `dp` table.\n\n5. Construct the final superstring by concatenating the strings according to the path, using the overlaps to avoid redundancy.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate_overlap(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:\n        max_overlap = 0\n        for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n            if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n                max_overlap = i\n        return max_overlap\n\n    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:\n        n = len(A)\n        overlap = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        # Calculate overlap between each pair of strings\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i != j:\n                    overlap[i][j] = self.calculate_overlap(A[i], A[j])\n        \n        # dp[mask][i] will be the length of the shortest superstring that contains\n        # the strings represented by mask and ends with A[i]\n        dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n        parent = [[-1] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n        \n        # Initialize dp for single strings\n        for i in range(n):\n            dp[1 << i][i] = len(A[i])\n        \n        # Fill dp table\n        for mask in range(1 << n):\n            for i in range(n):\n                if not (mask & (1 << i)):\n                    continue\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if mask & (1 << j):\n                        continue\n                    new_mask = mask | (1 << j)\n                    new_length = dp[mask][i] + len(A[j]) - overlap[i][j]\n                    if new_length < dp[new_mask][j]:\n                        dp[new_mask][j] = new_length\n                        parent[new_mask][j] = i\n        \n        # Find the end of the shortest superstring\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        last = -1\n        final_mask = (1 << n) - 1\n        for i in range(n):\n            if dp[final_mask][i] < min_length:\n                min_length = dp[final_mask][i]\n                last = i\n        \n        # Reconstruct the shortest superstring\n        mask = final_mask\n        path = []\n        while last != -1:\n            path.append(last)\n            next_last = parent[mask][last]\n            mask ^= (1 << last)\n            last = next_last\n        \n        path.reverse()\n        \n        # Build the superstring using the path\n        superstring = A[path[0]]\n        for k in range(1, len(path)):\n            i, j = path[k-1], path[k]\n            superstring += A[j][overlap[i][j]:]\n        \n        return superstring\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the shortest superstring by maximizing the overlap between strings. The `calculate_overlap` function computes the maximum overlap between two strings, which is used to build the `overlap` matrix. The `dp` table is then used to find the optimal path that results in the shortest superstring.",
