    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe have a string `S` and we form a pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. The characters in each row are formed by repeating the string `S` in a cyclic manner. We are given another string `T` and need to answer `Q` queries. Each query provides a row number `N`, and we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Pyramid**: \n   - The `N`-th row of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string `S` until it reaches a length of `N`.\n   - This means the `N`-th row is `S` repeated `N // len(S)` times plus the first `N % len(S)` characters of `S`.\n\n2. **Finding Substring Occurrences**:\n   - For each query, construct the `N`-th row as described.\n   - Count the number of times `T` appears as a substring in this row.\n\n3. **Efficiency Considerations**:\n   - Directly constructing the `N`-th row for very large `N` is inefficient.\n   - Instead, use the properties of cyclic repetition to determine the row content without explicitly constructing it.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    results = []\n    len_s = length of S\n    len_t = length of T\n\n    for each query N in queries:\n        # Calculate the effective row\n        full_repeats = N // len_s\n        remainder = N % len_s\n\n        # Construct the row\n        row = S * full_repeats + S[:remainder]\n\n        # Count occurrences of T in the row\n        count = 0\n        for i from 0 to length of row - len_t:\n            if row[i:i+len_t] == T:\n                count += 1\n\n        results.append(count)\n\n    return results\n```\n\n### Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    results = []\n    len_s = len(S)\n    len_t = len(T)\n\n    for N in queries:\n        # Calculate the effective row\n        full_repeats = N // len_s\n        remainder = N % len_s\n\n        # Construct the row\n        row = S * full_repeats + S[:remainder]\n\n        # Count occurrences of T in the row\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(row) - len_t + 1):\n            if row[i:i+len_t] == T:\n                count += 1\n\n        results.append(count)\n\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    S = data[0]\n    T = data[1]\n    Q = int(data[2])\n    queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]\n    \n    results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Row Construction**: For each query, we determine how many full repetitions of `S` fit into the row and how many additional characters are needed.\n- **Substring Search**: We then search for `T` in this constructed row.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the construction of the row and the search for `T` by leveraging Python's string slicing and comparison operations.",
