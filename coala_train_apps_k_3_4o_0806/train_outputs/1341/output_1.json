    "raw_msg": "To solve the problem correctly, we need to focus on identifying the number of ways to remove a contiguous subsequence such that the remaining sequence is strictly increasing. Here's the correct approach:\n\n### Correct Approach\n\n1. **Identify Non-Increasing Segments**:\n   - Traverse the sequence and identify segments where the sequence is not strictly increasing.\n   - For each such segment, calculate the number of ways to remove it.\n\n2. **Calculate Ways to Remove**:\n   - For each segment, calculate the number of ways to remove it by considering the elements before and after the segment.\n\n3. **Iterate Over the Sequence**:\n   - Use two pointers to iterate over the sequence and identify segments that are not strictly increasing.\n   - For each segment, calculate the number of ways to remove it by considering the elements before and after the segment.\n\n### Revised Python Code\n\n```python\ndef count_ways_to_remove(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N = test_case[0]\n        A = test_case[1]\n        \n        total_ways = 0\n        last_increasing_index = -1\n        \n        for i in range(N):\n            if i == 0 or A[i] > A[i - 1]:\n                # If the current element is greater than the previous one, it's part of an increasing sequence\n                last_increasing_index = i\n            else:\n                # Calculate the number of ways to remove the non-increasing segment\n                # The segment is from last_increasing_index + 1 to i\n                # We can remove any contiguous subsequence from this segment\n                length = i - last_increasing_index\n                total_ways += length\n        \n        results.append(total_ways)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n    count_ways_to_remove(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Revised Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: The `main` function reads all input data at once and splits it into manageable parts. It then constructs the list of test cases.\n- **Segment Identification**: For each test case, the code identifies segments of the sequence that are not strictly increasing.\n- **Ways Calculation**: For each segment, the number of ways to remove it is calculated by considering the elements before and after the segment.\n- **Output**: The results for each test case are collected and printed at the end.\n\nThis revised approach should correctly calculate the number of ways to remove a contiguous subsequence such that the remaining sequence is strictly increasing.",
