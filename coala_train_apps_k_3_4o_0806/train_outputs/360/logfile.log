## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4

Example 3:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000
1 <= weights[i] <= 500

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. We need to ship all these packages within a given number of days, `D`. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded on any day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to find the minimum possible weight capacity of the ship that allows us to ship all packages within `D` days.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - The minimum possible capacity of the ship must be at least the weight of the heaviest package, because we cannot split packages.
   - The maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights, which would allow us to ship all packages in one day.
   - We can use a binary search to find the minimum capacity between these two extremes.
   - For each capacity value in our binary search, we simulate the shipping process to check if it's possible to ship all packages within `D` days.
   - If a capacity allows shipping within `D` days, we try a smaller capacity; otherwise, we increase the capacity.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function canShip(weights, D, capacity):
       Initialize days to 1
       Initialize current_weight to 0
       For each weight in weights:
           If current_weight + weight > capacity:
               Increment days
               Set current_weight to 0
           Add weight to current_weight
       Return whether days <= D

   Define function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
       Set left to max(weights)
       Set right to sum(weights)
       While left < right:
           Set mid to (left + right) // 2
           If canShip(weights, D, mid):
               Set right to mid
           Else:
               Set left to mid + 1
       Return left
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    # Helper function to determine if we can ship within D days with given capacity
    def canShip(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:
        days = 1  # Start with the first day
        current_weight = 0  # Current weight on the ship for the current day
        
        for weight in weights:
            # If adding this package exceeds capacity, we need a new day
            if current_weight + weight > capacity:
                days += 1  # Increment the day count
                current_weight = 0  # Reset current weight for the new day
            
            current_weight += weight  # Add the package to the current day's load
        
        # Check if the number of days used is within the allowed days
        return days <= D

    # Main function to find the minimum ship capacity to ship within D days
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        left = max(weights)  # Minimum capacity must be at least the heaviest package
        right = sum(weights)  # Maximum capacity is the sum of all weights
        
        # Binary search for the minimum capacity
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2  # Midpoint of current capacity range
            
            # Check if we can ship with this capacity
            if self.canShip(weights, D, mid):
                right = mid  # Try a smaller capacity
            else:
                left = mid + 1  # Increase capacity
        
        return left  # The minimum capacity that works
```

This solution uses a binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity needed to ship all packages within the given number of days. The `canShip` helper function checks if a given capacity is sufficient to meet the requirement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints. The problem required understanding how to efficiently calculate the number of contests based on the total number of problems available and the constraints of days and problems per contest.

    The key steps involved:
    1. **Summing Problems**: Calculate the total number of problems available from all setters.
    2. **Calculating Contests**: Determine how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`).
    3. **Limiting by Days**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days (`D`), so the final result is the minimum of the possible contests and the available days.

    The solution was straightforward once the constraints were clearly understood. The main challenge was ensuring that the logic correctly handled the constraints and efficiently processed multiple test cases. The use of integer division and the `min` function were crucial in determining the correct number of contests.

    The problem reinforced the importance of breaking down constraints and using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems efficiently. The solution was implemented in Python, leveraging built-in functions for input handling and arithmetic operations. This approach can be applied to similar problems where resources are limited by multiple constraints.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is straightforward given the problem constraints. The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted, given the number of problems available and the number of days.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Problem Breakdown**: Both solutions correctly identify that the total number of problems needs to be divided by `K` to determine how many full contests can be formed. This is a simple division operation.

    2. **Limiting Factor**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the final result is the minimum of the number of full contests possible and `D`.

    3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is concise and efficient, using list comprehensions and direct input handling. It avoids unnecessary complexity and directly computes the required values.

    ### Reflection:

    - **Simplicity and Clarity**: The official solution is a good reminder of the power of simplicity. It uses minimal lines of code to achieve the desired result, which is both efficient and easy to understand.

    - **Input Handling**: The official solution uses `eval(input())` for reading input, which is a quick way to handle multiple test cases. However, in practice, using `sys.stdin.read` can be more efficient for large inputs, as it reads all input at once.

    - **Direct Calculation**: The use of `sum(A)//K` directly in the print statement is a neat way to avoid extra variables, making the code more concise.

    Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of understanding the constraints and using them to simplify the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    **Initial Strategy:**
    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \( N \).

    **Correct Strategy:**
    The correct formula is:
    \[ \text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \]
    This formula:
    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.
    - Uses \( 3^{(N-2)} \) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.
    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.

    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

We have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. We need to ship all these packages within a given number of days, D. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded each day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to find the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows us to ship all packages within D days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach to find the minimum ship capacity. The key idea is to determine the smallest capacity that allows us to ship all packages within D days. The minimum possible capacity is the weight of the heaviest package (since we must be able to ship each package individually), and the maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights (if we ship all packages in one day). We perform a binary search between these two limits to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within D days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
Define a function canShip(weights, D, capacity):
    Initialize days_needed to 1
    Initialize current_weight to 0
    For each weight in weights:
        If current_weight + weight > capacity:
            Increment days_needed
            Set current_weight to weight
            If days_needed > D:
                Return False
        Else:
            Add weight to current_weight
    Return True

Define a function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
    Set left to the maximum weight in weights
    Set right to the sum of weights
    While left < right:
        Set mid to (left + right) // 2
        If canShip(weights, D, mid):
            Set right to mid
        Else:
            Set left to mid + 1
    Return left
```

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

```

This solution uses a binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity needed to ship all packages within the given number of days, D. The `canShip` function checks if a given capacity is sufficient to ship all packages within D days.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

We have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. We need to ship all these packages within a given number of days, D. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded each day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to find the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows us to ship all packages within D days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach to find the minimum ship capacity. The key idea is to determine the smallest capacity that allows us to ship all packages within D days. The minimum possible capacity is the weight of the heaviest package (since we must be able to ship each package individually), and the maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights (if we ship all packages in one day). We perform a binary search between these two limits to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within D days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

```
Define a function canShip(weights, D, capacity):
    Initialize days_needed to 1
    Initialize current_weight to 0
    For each weight in weights:
        If current_weight + weight > capacity:
            Increment days_needed
            Set current_weight to weight
            If days_needed > D:
                Return False
        Else:
            Add weight to current_weight
    Return True

Define a function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
    Set left to the maximum weight in weights
    Set right to the sum of weights
    While left < right:
        Set mid to (left + right) // 2
        If canShip(weights, D, mid):
            Set right to mid
        Else:
            Set left to mid + 1
    Return left

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5

Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3

A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4

Example 3:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st day: 1

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum ship capacity required to transport all packages within a specified number of days, D. The key challenge was to ensure that the ship's capacity was neither too small (causing more days than allowed) nor unnecessarily large.

The core concept involved using a binary search to efficiently find the minimum capacity. The binary search was conducted between two bounds: the maximum weight of a single package (as the ship must at least carry the heaviest package) and the sum of all package weights (if all packages were shipped in one day). The helper function `canShip` was crucial in determining if a given capacity could successfully ship all packages within the allowed days.

This approach was effective because it reduced the problem's complexity from a potentially exhaustive search to a logarithmic one, leveraging the sorted nature of the search space. The binary search pattern is a powerful tool for optimization problems where a decision can be made based on a threshold value.

The solution was implemented successfully without encountering significant errors, demonstrating the effectiveness of binary search in solving capacity-related problems. This experience reinforced the utility of binary search in optimization problems and the importance of defining clear helper functions to encapsulate decision logic.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] The problem of determining the minimum ship capacity to transport packages within a specified number of days is a classic example of using binary search to optimize a solution. Here are some key insights and reflections from the problem-solving process:

### Key Insights:

1. **Binary Search on Capacity:**
   - Both my solution and the official solution use binary search to find the minimum capacity. The idea is to search between the maximum single package weight (as the lower bound) and a calculated upper bound based on the total weight and number of days.

2. **Capacity Bounds:**
   - My solution used the sum of all weights as the upper bound, which is a straightforward approach. The official solution uses a more refined upper bound, `left * len(weights) // D`, which is derived from distributing the maximum weight evenly across the days. This can potentially reduce the search space, making the solution more efficient.

3. **Day Calculation:**
   - Both solutions calculate the number of days required for a given capacity by iterating through the weights and accumulating them until the capacity is exceeded, at which point a new day is started. This is a crucial step to ensure that the capacity being tested can indeed ship all packages within the allowed days.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The official solution's use of a refined upper bound for the binary search range can lead to fewer iterations, potentially improving efficiency, especially for larger inputs.

### Reflection:

The problem reinforces the utility of binary search in optimization problems where a decision can be made based on a threshold (in this case, the ship's capacity). The official solution's approach to setting a more precise upper bound is insightful and can be a useful technique in similar problems to reduce the search space. This experience highlights the importance of considering different ways to define search boundaries in binary search problems, which can lead to more efficient solutions.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum ship capacity required to transport all packages within a specified number of days, D. The key challenge was to ensure that the ship's capacity was neither too small (causing more days than allowed) nor unnecessarily large.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] The function determines the minimum ship capacity required to deliver all packages within a given number of days, D. It uses a binary search approach to efficiently find this minimum capacity. The search range is set between the weight of the heaviest package and the total weight of all packages. For each midpoint capacity in this range, it checks if the packages can be shipped within D days using a helper function. If shipping is possible with the current capacity, it attempts to find a smaller capacity by adjusting the search range. The process continues until the smallest feasible capacity is found, which is then returned.

[Problem]
    A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
    The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
    Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
    Output: 15
    Explanation: 
    A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
    1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    2nd day: 6, 7
    3rd day: 8
    4th day: 9
    5th day: 10

    Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

    Example 2:
    Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
    1st day: 3, 2
    2nd day: 2, 4
    3rd day: 1, 4

    Example 3:
    Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    1st day: 1
    2nd day: 2
    3rd day: 3
    4th day: 1, 1

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000
    1 <= weights[i] <= 500
