    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\nWe have a conveyor belt with packages, each having a specific weight. We need to ship all these packages within a given number of days, D. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded each day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to find the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows us to ship all packages within D days.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach to find the minimum ship capacity. The key idea is to determine the smallest capacity that allows us to ship all packages within D days. The minimum possible capacity is the weight of the heaviest package (since we must be able to ship each package individually), and the maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights (if we ship all packages in one day). We perform a binary search between these two limits to find the minimum capacity that allows shipping within D days.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n```\nDefine a function canShip(weights, D, capacity):\n    Initialize days_needed to 1\n    Initialize current_weight to 0\n    For each weight in weights:\n        If current_weight + weight > capacity:\n            Increment days_needed\n            Set current_weight to weight\n            If days_needed > D:\n                Return False\n        Else:\n            Add weight to current_weight\n    Return True\n\nDefine a function shipWithinDays(weights, D):\n    Set left to the maximum weight in weights\n    Set right to the sum of weights\n    While left < right:\n        Set mid to (left + right) // 2\n        If canShip(weights, D, mid):\n            Set right to mid\n        Else:\n            Set left to mid + 1\n    Return left\n```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    # Helper function to determine if we can ship all packages within D days with a given capacity\n    def canShip(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:\n        days_needed = 1\n        current_weight = 0\n        for weight in weights:\n            # If adding this package exceeds capacity, we need a new day\n            if current_weight + weight > capacity:\n                days_needed += 1\n                current_weight = weight\n                # If we need more days than allowed, return False\n                if days_needed > D:\n                    return False\n            else:\n                current_weight += weight\n        return True\n\n    # Main function to find the minimum ship capacity to ship within D days\n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:\n        # The minimum capacity is at least the weight of the heaviest package\n        left = max(weights)\n        # The maximum capacity is the sum of all package weights\n        right = sum(weights)\n        \n        # Perform binary search to find the minimum capacity\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            # Check if we can ship with this mid capacity\n            if self.canShip(weights, D, mid):\n                right = mid  # Try for a smaller capacity\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1  # Increase capacity\n        return left\n```\n\nThis solution uses a binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity needed to ship all packages within the given number of days, D. The `canShip` function checks if a given capacity is sufficient to ship all packages within D days.",
