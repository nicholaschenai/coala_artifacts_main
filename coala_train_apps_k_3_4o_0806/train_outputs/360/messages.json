We need to ship all these packages within a given number of days, `D`. Each day, we can load the ship with packages in the order they appear on the conveyor belt, but the total weight of packages loaded on any day cannot exceed the ship's weight capacity. Our task is to find the minimum possible weight capacity of the ship that allows us to ship all packages within `D` days.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - The minimum possible capacity of the ship must be at least the weight of the heaviest package, because we cannot split packages.\n   - The maximum possible capacity is the sum of all package weights, which would allow us to ship all packages in one day.\n   - We can use a binary search to find the minimum capacity between these two extremes.\n   - For each capacity value in our binary search, we simulate the shipping process to check if it's possible to ship all packages within `D` days.\n   - If a capacity allows shipping within `D` days, we try a smaller capacity; otherwise, we increase the capacity.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function canShip(weights, D, capacity):\n       Initialize days to 1\n       Initialize current_weight to 0\n       For each weight in weights:\n           If current_weight + weight > capacity:\n               Increment days\n               Set current_weight to 0\n           Add weight to current_weight\n       Return whether days <= D\n\n   Define function shipWithinDays(weights, D):\n       Set left to max(weights)\n       Set right to sum(weights)\n       While left < right:\n           Set mid to (left + right) // 2\n           If canShip(weights, D, mid):\n               Set right to mid\n           Else:\n               Set left to mid + 1\n       Return left\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    # Helper function to determine if we can ship within D days with given capacity\n    def canShip(self, weights: List[int], D: int, capacity: int) -> bool:\n        days = 1  # Start with the first day\n        current_weight = 0  # Current weight on the ship for the current day\n        \n        for weight in weights:\n            # If adding this package exceeds capacity, we need a new day\n            if current_weight + weight > capacity:\n                days += 1  # Increment the day count\n                current_weight = 0  # Reset current weight for the new day\n            \n            current_weight += weight  # Add the package to the current day's load\n        \n        # Check if the number of days used is within the allowed days\n        return days <= D\n\n    # Main function to find the minimum ship capacity to ship within D days\n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:\n        left = max(weights)  # Minimum capacity must be at least the heaviest package\n        right = sum(weights)  # Maximum capacity is the sum of all weights\n        \n        # Binary search for the minimum capacity\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2  # Midpoint of current capacity range\n            \n            # Check if we can ship with this capacity\n            if self.canShip(weights, D, mid):\n                right = mid  # Try a smaller capacity\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1  # Increase capacity\n        \n        return left  # The minimum capacity that works\n```\n\nThis solution uses a binary search to efficiently find the minimum ship capacity needed to ship all packages within the given number of days. The `canShip` helper function checks if a given capacity is sufficient to meet the requirement."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints. The problem required understanding how to efficiently calculate the number of contests based on the total number of problems available and the constraints of days and problems per contest.\n\n    The key steps involved:\n    1. **Summing Problems**: Calculate the total number of problems available from all setters.\n    2. **Calculating Contests**: Determine how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`).\n    3. **Limiting by Days**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days (`D`), so the final result is the minimum of the possible contests and the available days.\n\n    The solution was straightforward once the constraints were clearly understood. The main challenge was ensuring that the logic correctly handled the constraints and efficiently processed multiple test cases. The use of integer division and the `min` function were crucial in determining the correct number of contests.\n\n    The problem reinforced the importance of breaking down constraints and using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems efficiently. The solution was implemented in Python, leveraging built-in functions for input handling and arithmetic operations. This approach can be applied to similar problems where resources are limited by multiple constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is straightforward given the problem constraints. The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted, given the number of problems available and the number of days.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n\n    1. **Problem Breakdown**: Both solutions correctly identify that the total number of problems needs to be divided by `K` to determine how many full contests can be formed. This is a simple division operation.\n\n    2. **Limiting Factor**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the final result is the minimum of the number of full contests possible and `D`.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is concise and efficient, using list comprehensions and direct input handling. It avoids unnecessary complexity and directly computes the required values.\n\n    ### Reflection:\n\n    - **Simplicity and Clarity**: The official solution is a good reminder of the power of simplicity. It uses minimal lines of code to achieve the desired result, which is both efficient and easy to understand.\n\n    - **Input Handling**: The official solution uses `eval(input())` for reading input, which is a quick way to handle multiple test cases. However, in practice, using `sys.stdin.read` can be more efficient for large inputs, as it reads all input at once.\n\n    - **Direct Calculation**: The use of `sum(A)//K` directly in the print statement is a neat way to avoid extra variables, making the code more concise.\n\n    Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of understanding the constraints and using them to simplify the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**\n    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n    **Initial Strategy:**\n    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\n    **Correct Strategy:**\n    The correct formula is:\n    \\[ \\text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\]\n    This formula:\n    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.\n    - Uses \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.\n    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.\n\n    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**\n    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n    **Final Code Snippet:**\n    ```python\n    def count_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return 12\n        else:\n            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = count_schedules(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The idea is to search between the maximum single package weight (as the lower bound) and a calculated upper bound based on the total weight and number of days.\n\n2. **Capacity Bounds:**\n   - My solution used the sum of all weights as the upper bound, which is a straightforward approach. The official solution uses a more refined upper bound, `left * len(weights) // D`, which is derived from distributing the maximum weight evenly across the days. This can potentially reduce the search space, making the solution more efficient.\n\n3. **Day Calculation:**\n   - Both solutions calculate the number of days required for a given capacity by iterating through the weights and accumulating them until the capacity is exceeded, at which point a new day is started. This is a crucial step to ensure that the capacity being tested can indeed ship all packages within the allowed days.\n\n4. **Efficiency:**\n   - The official solution's use of a refined upper bound for the binary search range can lead to fewer iterations, potentially improving efficiency, especially for larger inputs.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe problem reinforces the utility of binary search in optimization problems where a decision can be made based on a threshold (in this case, the ship's capacity).
