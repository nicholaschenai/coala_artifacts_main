    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\nChef has a time machine with buttons that can adjust the number of tasks planned or completed each day. For each day, Chef can press one button to either reduce the planned tasks or increase the completed tasks, but only if the button's value doesn't violate the constraints. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after all days have been processed.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n- For each day, calculate the initial uncompleted tasks as the difference between planned and completed tasks.\n- Use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks, starting with the largest button that can be used without making planned tasks negative.\n- Use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks, starting with the largest button that can be used without exceeding the planned tasks.\n- Repeat this process for each day, ensuring that each button is used only once.\n- Sum the uncompleted tasks after processing all days to get the minimum possible total.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n```\nfunction minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N, K, M\n        read planned_tasks (A)\n        read completed_tasks (B)\n        read white_buttons (C)\n        read black_buttons (D)\n        \n        sort C in descending order\n        sort D in descending order\n        \n        total_uncompleted = 0\n        \n        for each day i from 0 to N-1:\n            uncompleted = A[i] - B[i]\n            \n            for each white_button in C:\n                if A[i] >= white_button:\n                    A[i] -= white_button\n                    break\n            \n            for each black_button in D:\n                if B[i] + black_button <= A[i]:\n                    B[i] += black_button\n                    break\n            \n            total_uncompleted += (A[i] - B[i])\n        \n        print total_uncompleted\n```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        # Unpack the test case\n        N, K, M = test_case[0]\n        planned_tasks = test_case[1]\n        completed_tasks = test_case[2]\n        white_buttons = test_case[3]\n        black_buttons = test_case[4]\n        \n        # Sort the buttons in descending order to use the largest first\n        white_buttons.sort(reverse=True)\n        black_buttons.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        total_uncompleted = 0\n        \n        # Process each day\n        for i in range(N):\n            # Calculate initial uncompleted tasks for the day\n            uncompleted = planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i]\n            \n            # Try to use a white button to reduce planned tasks\n            for white_button in white_buttons:\n                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:\n                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button\n                    # Remove the used button\n                    white_buttons.remove(white_button)\n                    break\n            \n            # Try to use a black button to increase completed tasks\n            for black_button in black_buttons:\n                if completed_tasks[i] + black_button <= planned_tasks[i]:\n                    completed_tasks[i] += black_button\n                    # Remove the used button\n                    black_buttons.remove(black_button)\n                    break\n            \n            # Update the total uncompleted tasks\n            total_uncompleted += (planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i])\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(total_uncompleted)\n    \n    # Output all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = number of test cases\n# test_cases = list of tuples, each containing (N, K, M), planned_tasks, completed_tasks, white_buttons, black_buttons\n# minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis solution processes each test case by iterating over the days and using the largest possible buttons to minimize uncompleted tasks, ensuring each button is used only once.",
