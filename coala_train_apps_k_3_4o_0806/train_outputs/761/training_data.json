    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n**Core Concepts:**\n- The problem involves optimizing the use of resources (buttons) to minimize a cost (uncompleted tasks).\n- It tests the ability to apply greedy algorithms and dynamic decision-making to achieve optimal results.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n- The initial approach was to use the largest available button for each day, which seemed intuitive but failed to consider the overall impact across all days.\n- This approach was too localized and did not account for the potential benefits of using a button on a different day.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n- The revised strategy involved sorting the buttons and attempting to use them on the day where they would have the maximum impact.\n- This involved iterating over all days for each button to find the optimal day for its use, which improved the solution but still did not yield the correct results.\n\n**Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**\n- The main error was in the logic of updating the uncompleted tasks after using a button. The solution needed to ensure that the uncompleted tasks were recalculated correctly after each button press.\n- The solution also needed to ensure that the buttons were used in a way that maximized their impact across all days, not just the current day.\n\n**Final Insights:**\n- The problem required a more holistic view of the task distribution and button usage, rather than a day-by-day approach.\n- It highlighted the importance of recalculating and updating state variables (like uncompleted tasks) accurately after each operation.\n- The experience reinforced the need to balance local optimizations with global strategy in optimization problems.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The task is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after using a set of buttons optimally. Each button can either reduce planned tasks or increase completed tasks, but only under certain conditions.\n\n2. **My Approach:**\n   - I attempted to use a greedy strategy by iterating over each day and trying to use the largest possible button to minimize uncompleted tasks. However, this approach failed to account for the overall impact of button usage across all days.\n\n3. **Official Solution Insights:**\n   - The official solution takes a different approach by first calculating the difference between planned and completed tasks for each day.\n   - It then combines all buttons into a single list, sorts them, and applies them to the days with the highest uncompleted tasks first.\n   - This approach is more effective because it prioritizes reducing the largest uncompleted tasks, which is a more optimal strategy for minimizing the total uncompleted tasks.\n\n4. **Key Takeaways:**\n   - The official solution highlights the importance of sorting and prioritizing tasks based on their impact. By sorting the differences and buttons, the solution ensures that the most significant reductions are made first.\n   - This problem emphasizes the need to consider the global impact of local decisions, especially in optimization problems where resources (buttons) are limited.\n\nIn future problem-solving scenarios, it will be beneficial to consider strategies that prioritize the most impactful actions first, especially when dealing with constraints and limited resources. This approach can often lead to more optimal solutions than a straightforward greedy approach.",
