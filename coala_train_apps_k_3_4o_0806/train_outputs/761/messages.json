He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.\nThe good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! \nThe Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.\nPressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.\nPressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.\nChef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?\nBe careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nChef has a schedule of tasks planned over several days. For each day, he has a certain number of tasks planned and a certain number of tasks completed. Chef can use a time machine with two types of buttons: white buttons that reduce the number of planned tasks and black buttons that increase the number of completed tasks. Each button can only be used once, and there are constraints on when they can be used. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - A white button can only be used if the planned tasks for the day are greater than or equal to the button's value.\n   - A black button can only be used if the completed tasks plus the button's value do not exceed the planned tasks for that day.\n\n2. **Objective**: Minimize the total uncompleted tasks, which is the sum of (planned tasks - completed tasks) for all days.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction in planned tasks.\n   - Sort the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.\n   - For each day, try to use the largest possible white button to reduce planned tasks.\n   - Then, try to use the largest possible black button to increase completed tasks.\n   - Keep track of the total uncompleted tasks after applying the buttons.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N, K, M\n        read planned_tasks (A)\n        read completed_tasks (B)\n        read white_buttons (C)\n        read black_buttons (D)\n        \n        sort C in descending order\n        sort D in descending order\n        \n        for each day i from 0 to N-1:\n            for each white_button in C:\n                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_button:\n                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_button\n                    remove white_button from C\n                    break\n            \n            for each black_button in D:\n                if completed_tasks[i] + black_button <= planned_tasks[i]:\n                    completed_tasks[i] += black_button\n                    remove black_button from D\n                    break\n        \n        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i] for i in range(N))\n        print total_uncompleted_tasks\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K, M = test_case['N'], test_case['K'], test_case['M']\n        planned_tasks = test_case['planned_tasks']\n        completed_tasks = test_case['completed_tasks']\n        white_buttons = sorted(test_case['white_buttons'], reverse=True)\n        black_buttons = sorted(test_case['black_buttons'], reverse=True)\n        \n        # Apply white buttons\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(len(white_buttons)):\n                if planned_tasks[i] >= white_buttons[j]:\n                    planned_tasks[i] -= white_buttons[j]\n                    white_buttons.pop(j)\n                    break\n        \n        # Apply black buttons\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(len(black_buttons)):\n                if completed_tasks[i] + black_buttons[j] <= planned_tasks[i]:\n                    completed_tasks[i] += black_buttons[j]\n                    black_buttons.pop(j)\n                    break\n        \n        # Calculate total uncompleted tasks\n        total_uncompleted_tasks = sum(planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i] for i in range(N))\n        results.append(total_uncompleted_tasks)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = 1\n# test_cases = [\n#     {\n#         'N': 4,\n#         'K': 2,\n#         'M': 2,\n#         'planned_tasks': [5, 7, 6, 1],\n#         'completed_tasks': [3, 3, 1, 1],\n#         'white_buttons': [6, 3],\n#         'black_buttons': [1, 4]\n#     }\n# ]\n# minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes each test case by applying the buttons optimally, and outputs the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks."

The problem required understanding how to efficiently calculate the number of contests based on the total number of problems available and the constraints of days and problems per contest.\n\n    The key steps involved:\n    1. **Summing Problems**: Calculate the total number of problems available from all setters.\n    2. **Calculating Contests**: Determine how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`).\n    3. **Limiting by Days**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days (`D`), so the final result is the minimum of the possible contests and the available days.\n\n    The solution was straightforward once the constraints were clearly understood. The main challenge was ensuring that the logic correctly handled the constraints and efficiently processed multiple test cases. The use of integer division and the `min` function were crucial in determining the correct number of contests.\n\n    The problem reinforced the importance of breaking down constraints and using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems efficiently. The solution was implemented in Python, leveraging built-in functions for input handling and arithmetic operations. This approach can be applied to similar problems where resources are limited by multiple constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**\n    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n    **Initial Strategy:**\n    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\n    **Correct Strategy:**\n    The correct formula is:\n    \\[ \\text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\]\n    This formula:\n    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.\n    - Uses \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.\n    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.\n\n    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**\n    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n    **Final Code Snippet:**\n    ```python\n    def count_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return 12\n        else:\n            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = count_schedules(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, K = test_case[0]\n            demands = test_case[1]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n            index += 2\n            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Instead, it should iterate over days and use buttons optimally without modifying the list during iteration.\n\n4. **Output Collection:**\n   - The results are collected in a list and printed at the end, but if the function is not called or if the input/output handling is incorrect, this will not produce the expected output.\n\nLet's correct these issues step-by-step:\n\n1. **Use Standard Input/Output:**\n   - Read all input at once and parse it.\n   - Print results directly to standard output.\n\n2. **Efficient Button Usage:**\n   - Use a pointer or index to track the next available button instead of removing elements from the list.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Days:**\n   - For each day, try to use the largest possible button that fits the constraints.\n\n4. **Ensure Function Execution:**\n   - Make sure the function is called and processes the input correctly.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef minimize_uncompleted_tasks():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, M = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n        index += 3\n        planned_tasks = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n        index += N\n        completed_tasks = list(map(int, data[index:index+N]))\n        index += N\n        white_buttons = list(map(int, data[index:index+K]))\n        index += K\n        black_buttons = list(map(int, data[index:index+M]))\n        index += M\n        \n        # Sort buttons in descending order\n        white_buttons.sort(reverse=True)\n        black_buttons.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        total_uncompleted = 0\n        \n        # Pointers for buttons\n        white_index = 0\n        black_index = 0\n        \n        # Process each day\n        for i in range(N):\n            # Try to use a white button to reduce planned tasks\n            while white_index < K and planned_tasks[i] >= white_buttons[white_index]:\n                planned_tasks[i] -= white_buttons[white_index]\n                white_index += 1\n            \n            # Try to use a black button to increase completed tasks\n            while black_index < M and completed_tasks[i] + black_buttons[black_index] <= planned_tasks[i]:\n                completed_tasks[i] += black_buttons[black_index]\n                black_index += 1\n            \n            # Update the total uncompleted tasks\n            total_uncompleted += (planned_tasks[i] - completed_tasks[i])\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(total_uncompleted)\n    \n    # Output all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Call the function to execute\nminimize_uncompleted_tasks()\n```\n\nThis solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the results to standard output. It uses pointers to track button usage efficiently without modifying the list during iteration."

The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, K = test_case[0]\n            demands = test_case[1]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n            index += 2\n            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.\n    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.\n    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct fixed this issue.\n    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.\n    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n        scores = [10] * N\n        for i, j, k in questions:\n            for student in range(i, j + 1):\n                scores[student] *= k\n        total_score = sum(scores)\n        mean_score = total_score // N\n        return mean_score\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            M = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            questions = []\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i = int(data[index]) - 1\n                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n                k = int(data[index + 2])\n                index += 3\n                questions.append((i, j, k))\n            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n            results.append(result)\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).\n        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.\n        Note f([1]) = 0.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.\n        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - 1 \u2264 T \u2264 40\n        - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file \u2264 106\n        - 0 \u2264 K \u2264 2 * 1010\n\n        -----Example-----\n        Input:\n        3\n        4 12\n        2 2\n        5 14\n\n        Output:\n        -1\n        1 2\n        5 4 3 2 1\n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.\n        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. \n        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:\n\n        ### Analysis of the Current Solution\n        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input and `sys.stdout.write` to output results. This is appropriate for competitive programming but can be tricky if not handled correctly. The function `find_permutation` is defined but not called, which means the code doesn't execute.\n\n        2. **Logic for Permutation Construction**:\n           - The logic attempts to start with the maximum possible sum by using a descending order permutation.\n           - It then tries to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K by swapping adjacent elements.\n\n        3. **Mistakes and Misunderstandings**:\n           - The function `find_permutation` is defined but never called, so no logic is executed.\n           - The permutation adjustment logic might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the sum needs to be reduced by more than one at a time.\n           - The permutation construction logic might not correctly handle cases where the desired sum K is exactly the maximum possible sum.\n\n        ### Steps to Correct the Solution\n        1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: Make sure the function is executed by calling it after its definition.\n        2. **Refine the Permutation Adjustment Logic**:\n           - Ensure that the logic correctly reduces the sum to K by considering larger swaps or more efficient adjustments.\n           - Handle edge cases where the desired sum is exactly the maximum possible sum.\n\n        3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test the solution with various edge cases to ensure correctness.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n        Let's revise the solution to address these issues:\n\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)\n                min_possible = N - 1\n                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n        \n                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    # Start with the permutation in descending order\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_sum = max_possible\n            \n                    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K\n                    for i in range(N - 1):\n                        if current_sum == K:\n                            break\n                        # Calculate the current max of the pair\n                        current_max = max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1])\n                        # Calculate the new max if we swap\n                        new_max = max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i + 2] if i + 2 < N else 0)\n                        # Calculate the difference\n                        diff = current_max - new_max\n                        # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap\n                        if current_sum - diff >= K:\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                            current_sum -= diff\n            \n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute\n        find_permutation()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Changes\n        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure execution.\n        - **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.\n        - **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called and the logic is correctly implemented to handle the permutation construction and adjustment.

Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.\n    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.\n    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct fixed this issue.\n    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.\n    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n        scores = [10] * N\n        for i, j, k in questions:\n            for student in range(i, j + 1):\n                scores[student] *= k\n        total_score = sum(scores)\n        mean_score = total_score // N\n        return mean_score\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            M = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            questions = []\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i = int(data[index]) - 1\n                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n                k = int(data[index + 2])\n                index += 3\n                questions.append((i, j, k))\n            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n            results.append(result)\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, K = test_case[0]\n            demands = test_case[1]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n            index += 2\n            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to maximize the number of chocolates Anushka could buy given a list of prices and a fixed budget. The core concept was to prioritize purchasing cheaper chocolates first to maximize the count, which is a classic example of a greedy algorithm.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Greedy Algorithm:** By sorting the prices in ascending order and purchasing the cheapest chocolates first, we ensure that we maximize the number of chocolates bought within the budget.\n    - **Input/Output Handling:** The problem required reading from standard input and writing to standard output, which is common in competitive programming and coding interviews.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Sorting:** Sorting the list of prices was crucial to implementing the greedy approach effectively.\n    - **Iterative Deduction:** Iterating through the sorted list and deducting each price from the budget until the budget could no longer cover the next chocolate was the main logic to solve the problem.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling:** Initially, the function was not called with the correct input format, which led to no output being detected. This was fixed by using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then parsing it appropriately.\n    - **Output:** Ensuring the result was printed to standard output was necessary for the solution to be evaluated correctly in the testing environment.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n        prices.sort()\n        count = 0\n        for price in prices:\n            if k >= price:\n                k -= price\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        return count\n\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    prices = list(map(int, data[2:]))\n    result = maxChocolates(n, k, prices)\n    print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of handling input/output correctly in coding challenges and the effectiveness of greedy algorithms in optimization problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.\n    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.\n    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct fixed this issue.\n    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.\n    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n        scores = [10] * N\n        for i, j, k in questions:\n            for student in range(i, j + 1):\n                scores[student] *= k\n        total_score = sum(scores)\n        mean_score = total_score // N\n        return mean_score\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            M = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            questions = []\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i = int(data[index]) - 1\n                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n                k = int(data[index + 2])\n                index += 3\n                questions.append((i, j, k))\n            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n            results.append(result)\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints. The problem required understanding how to efficiently calculate the number of contests based on the total number of problems available and the constraints of days and problems per contest.\n\n    The key steps involved:\n    1. **Summing Problems**: Calculate the total number of problems available from all setters.\n    2. **Calculating Contests**: Determine how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`).\n    3. **Limiting by Days**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days (`D`), so the final result is the minimum of the possible contests and the available days.\n\n    The solution was straightforward once the constraints were clearly understood. The main challenge was ensuring that the logic correctly handled the constraints and efficiently processed multiple test cases. The use of integer division and the `min` function were crucial in determining the correct number of contests.\n\n    The problem reinforced the importance of breaking down constraints and using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems efficiently. The solution was implemented in Python, leveraging built-in functions for input handling and arithmetic operations. This approach can be applied to similar problems where resources are limited by multiple constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, K = test_case[0]\n            demands = test_case[1]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n            index += 2\n            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

By sorting the differences and buttons, the solution ensures that the most significant reductions are made first.\n   - This problem emphasizes the need to consider the global impact of local decisions, especially in optimization problems where resources (buttons) are limited.\n\nIn future problem-solving scenarios, it will be beneficial to consider strategies that prioritize the most impactful actions first, especially when dealing with constraints and limited resources.
