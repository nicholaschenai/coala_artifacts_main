    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given two strings, `S` and `T`. Our task is to find the smallest substring in `S` that contains all the characters from `T`. If no such substring exists, we should return an empty string. We are guaranteed that there will be only one unique minimum window in `S` that contains all characters of `T`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with two pointers. The idea is to expand the window by moving the right pointer to include characters from `S` until the window contains all characters from `T`. Once we have a valid window, we try to shrink it from the left to find the minimum window. We keep track of the frequency of characters in the current window and compare it with the frequency of characters needed from `T`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function minWindow(S, T):\n       if T is empty or S is empty:\n           return \"\"\n\n       # Create a dictionary to count characters in T\n       dict_t = count characters in T\n\n       # Initialize variables\n       required = number of unique characters in T\n       left = 0\n       right = 0\n       formed = 0\n       window_counts = empty dictionary\n       ans = (float('inf'), None, None)  # (window length, left, right)\n\n       # Start sliding the window\n       while right < length of S:\n           # Add character from right to window\n           character = S[right]\n           add character to window_counts\n\n           # Check if current window has the required count of this character\n           if window_counts[character] == dict_t[character]:\n               formed += 1\n\n           # Try to contract the window until it ceases to be 'desirable'\n           while left <= right and formed == required:\n               character = S[left]\n\n               # Update the answer if this window is smaller\n               if right - left + 1 < ans[0]:\n                   ans = (right - left + 1, left, right)\n\n               # Remove character from left of window\n               window_counts[character] -= 1\n               if window_counts[character] < dict_t[character]:\n                   formed -= 1\n\n               # Move left pointer\n               left += 1\n\n           # Move right pointer\n           right += 1\n\n       # Return the smallest window or empty string if no window found\n       return \"\" if ans[0] == float('inf') else S[ans[1]:ans[2] + 1]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        if not t or not s:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        # Dictionary to keep a count of all the unique characters in t.\n        dict_t = {}\n        for char in t:\n            dict_t[char] = dict_t.get(char, 0) + 1\n        \n        # Number of unique characters in t that need to be present in the desired window.\n        required = len(dict_t)\n        \n        # Left and Right pointer\n        left, right = 0, 0\n        \n        # formed is used to keep track of how many unique characters in t\n        # are present in the current window in its desired frequency.\n        # e.g. if t is \"AABC\" then the window must have two A's, one B and one C.\n        formed = 0\n        \n        # Dictionary which keeps a count of all the unique characters in the current window.\n        window_counts = {}\n        \n        # ans tuple of the form (window length, left, right)\n        ans = float(\"inf\"), None, None\n        \n        while right < len(s):\n            # Add one character from the right to the window\n            character = s[right]\n            window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1\n            \n            # If the frequency of the current character added equals to the\n            # desired count in t then increment the formed count by 1.\n            if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] == dict_t[character]:\n                formed += 1\n            \n            # Try and contract the window till the point it ceases to be 'desirable'.\n            while left <= right and formed == required:\n                character = s[left]\n                \n                # Save the smallest window until now.\n                if right - left + 1 < ans[0]:\n                    ans = (right - left + 1, left, right)\n                \n                # The character at the position pointed by the `left` pointer is no longer\n                # a part of the window.\n                window_counts[character] -= 1\n                if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] < dict_t[character]:\n                    formed -= 1\n                \n                # Move the left pointer ahead, this would help to look for a new window.\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Keep expanding the window once we are done contracting.\n            right += 1\n        \n        return \"\" if ans[0] == float(\"inf\") else s[ans[1]:ans[2] + 1]\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the minimum window substring using a sliding window approach with two pointers, ensuring that the time complexity is O(n).",
