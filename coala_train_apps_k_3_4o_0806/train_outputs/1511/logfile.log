## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
4 5
I::M
9 10
MIM_XII:M

-----Example Output-----
1
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a row of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is calculated as `P = K + 1 - |j-i| - S`, where `|j-i|` is the distance between the magnet and iron, and `S` is the number of conducting sheets between them. The attraction is only possible if `P > 0` and there are no blocks ('X') between them. We need to find the maximum number of such magnet-iron pairs for each test case.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation**: First, split the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.
2. **Pairing**: For each segment, attempt to pair magnets and irons:
   - Use two lists to track the positions of magnets and irons.
   - Iterate through the segment, and for each magnet, try to find the nearest iron that can be attracted.
   - Calculate the attraction power considering the distance and the number of conducting sheets.
   - If the attraction power is positive, pair the magnet with the iron and remove both from their respective lists.
3. **Count Pairs**: Count the number of successful magnet-iron pairs for each segment and sum them up for the total result of the test case.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_magnets(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test case:
        N, K, S = test case
        segments = split S by 'X'
        total_pairs = 0
        for each segment in segments:
            magnets = []
            irons = []
            sheets_count = 0
            for each character in segment:
                if character is 'M':
                    add position to magnets
                if character is 'I':
                    add position to irons
                if character is ':':
                    increment sheets_count
            while both magnets and irons are not empty:
                magnet_pos = first element in magnets
                iron_pos = first element in irons
                distance = abs(magnet_pos - iron_pos)
                if magnet_pos < iron_pos:
                    sheets_between = count sheets between magnet_pos and iron_pos
                else:
                    sheets_between = count sheets between iron_pos and magnet_pos
                attraction_power = K + 1 - distance - sheets_between
                if attraction_power > 0:
                    increment total_pairs
                    remove first element from magnets
                    remove first element from irons
                else:
                    if magnet_pos < iron_pos:
                        remove first element from magnets
                    else:
                        remove first element from irons
        append total_pairs to results

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum of a subsequence of PokÃ©mon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.

    #### Strategies and Mistakes
    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.

    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.

    ### Code Snippet

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            n, strengths = test_case
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
            alternating_sum = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]
                else:
                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]
            results.append(alternating_sum)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
            test_cases.append((n, strengths))
    
        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.

        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 40
        - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file â‰¤ 106
        - 0 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 2 * 1010

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        3
        4 12
        2 2
        5 14

        Output:
        -1
        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

        ### Problem Restatement
        We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and need to find a permutation such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

        ### Conceptual Solution
        1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:
           \[
           f(P) = \max(p_1, p_2) + \max(p_2, p_3) + \ldots + \max(p_{N-1}, p_N)
           \]

        2. **Constraints and Observations**:
           - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.
           - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \(\frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\).

        3. **Approach**:
           - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
           - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

        4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
           - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
           - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

        ### Pseudocode
        ```
        function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
            for each (N, K) in test_cases:
                if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:
                    output -1
                else:
                    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
                    i = 0
                    while current_sum > K:
                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i+1]:
                            swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
                            current_sum -= 1
                        i += 1
                    output permutation
        ```

        ### Final Python Code
        ```python
        def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                if K < N - 1 or K > (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
                    i = 0
                    while current_sum > K:
                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_sum -= 1
                        i += 1
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        ```

        ### Explanation
        - We start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
        - We then iteratively swap adjacent elements to reduce the sum until it matches K.
        - This approach ensures that we efficiently find a permutation that satisfies the condition or determine that it's impossible.

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of finding a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K, I learned several key concepts and strategies:

    ### Core Concepts
    - **Permutation and Sum Calculation**: Understanding how to calculate the sum of maximums of consecutive pairs in a permutation and how to manipulate the permutation to achieve a desired sum.
    - **Constraints Handling**: Recognizing the minimum and maximum possible values of the function f(P) and using these to quickly determine if a solution is possible.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Initial Approach**: Starting with a descending order permutation to achieve the maximum possible sum and then adjusting it to reach the desired sum K by swapping elements.
    - **Function Execution**: Ensuring the function is called correctly to execute the logic, which was initially missed.
    - **Efficient Adjustment**: Implementing a loop to adjust the permutation by swapping adjacent elements, ensuring the sum is reduced correctly without overshooting the target K.

    ### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    - **Function Not Called**: The initial solution defined the function but did not call it, leading to no execution. This was fixed by explicitly calling the function.
    - **Permutation Adjustment Logic**: The logic needed refinement to handle cases where the sum needed to be reduced by more than one at a time, which was addressed by checking the difference in sums before and after potential swaps.

    This problem reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling in competitive programming and the need for efficient algorithms to handle large constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a row of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is calculated as \( P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j} \), where \( S_{i,j} \) is the number of conducting sheets between them. A magnet can attract iron if \( P_{i,j} > 0 \) and there are no blocks between them.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: First, split the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.

2. **Iterate through Segments**: For each segment, identify positions of magnets and irons.

3. **Calculate Attraction Power**: For each magnet-iron pair, calculate the attraction power considering the number of conducting sheets between them.

4. **Match Magnets and Irons**: Use a greedy approach to match magnets with irons, ensuring that the attraction power is positive and maximizing the number of matches.

5. **Count Matches**: Sum up the matches for each segment to get the total number of magnets that can attract iron.

We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is calculated as \( P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j} \), where \( S_{i,j} \) is the number of conducting sheets between them. A magnet can attract iron if \( P_{i,j} > 0 \) and there are no blocks between them.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: First, split the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.

2. **Iterate through Segments**: For each segment, identify positions of magnets and irons.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le K \le 10^5$
- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
4 5
I::M
9 10
MIM_XII:M

-----Example Output-----
1
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
Example case 2:
The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We have a row of cells, each containing either iron ('I'), a magnet ('M'), an empty space ('_'), a conducting sheet (':'), or a block ('X'). We need to determine the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron. The attraction power between a magnet and iron is calculated as \( P_{i,j} = K + 1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j} \), where \( S_{i,j} \) is the number of conducting sheets between them. A magnet can attract iron if \( P_{i,j} > 0 \) and there are no blocks between them.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Segmentation by Blocks**: First, split the string into segments separated by 'X', as no attraction can occur across a block.

2. **Iterate through Segments**: For each segment, identify positions of magnets and irons.

3. **Calculate Attraction Power**: For each magnet-iron pair, calculate the attraction power considering the number of conducting sheets between them.

4. **Match Magnets and Irons**: Use a greedy approach to match magnets with irons, ensuring that the attraction power is positive and maximizing the number of matches.

5. **Count Matches**: Sum up the matches for each segment to get the total number of magnets that can attract iron.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently match magnets ('M') with pieces of iron ('I') in a string, considering constraints like conducting sheets (':') and blocks ('X'). The challenge was to calculate the attraction power between magnets and irons and ensure that the power is positive while avoiding any blocks between them.

The successful strategy involved segmenting the string by blocks ('X') since no attraction can occur across them. Within each segment, I tracked the positions of magnets and irons, along with the count of conducting sheets encountered. Using a greedy approach, I matched magnets to irons by calculating the attraction power and ensuring it was positive. This approach efficiently handled the constraints and maximized the number of matches.

The key takeaway was the importance of segmenting the problem space to simplify calculations and using a greedy matching strategy to maximize results. This approach can be applied to similar problems where elements need to be paired under specific constraints. The solution was implemented in Python, leveraging basic list operations and loops to achieve the desired results.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1511 [generation text] The official solution provided is a straightforward approach to solving the problem, and it aligns closely with the conceptual solution I devised. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Two-Pointer Technique**: The solution uses a two-pointer approach to traverse the string. One pointer (`i`) is used to find magnets ('M'), and the other pointer (`j`) is used to find irons ('I'). This is efficient for matching pairs as it avoids unnecessary re-evaluation of previously checked positions.

2. **Handling Conducting Sheets**: The solution counts the number of conducting sheets (':') between the current magnet and iron to adjust the attraction power calculation. This is done by slicing the string between the two pointers and counting the ':' characters.

3. **Block Handling**: When encountering a block ('X'), both pointers are reset to the position after the block. This ensures that no attraction is attempted across blocks, which is a critical constraint of the problem.

4. **Attraction Power Calculation**: The attraction power is calculated using the formula \( t = K + 1 - |i-j| - \text{count of ':'} \). If the power is positive, a match is made, and both pointers are incremented to find the next potential pair.

5. **Greedy Matching**: The solution uses a greedy approach to match magnets and irons as soon as a valid pair is found, maximizing the number of matches.

The official solution is efficient and concise, leveraging the two-pointer technique to minimize the number of operations and handle the constraints effectively. This approach ensures that the solution runs in linear time relative to the length of the string, which is optimal given the problem constraints. This experience reinforces the utility of the two-pointer technique in problems involving pair matching with constraints.

[Problem]
    Chef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:
    - 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron
    - 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet
    - '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty
    - ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet
    - 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked
    If there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.
    Chef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
    - The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 2,000$
    - $1 \le N \le 10^5$
    - $0 \le K \le 10^5$
    - $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'
    - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^6$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'
    Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

    -----Example Input-----
    2
    4 5
    I::M
    9 10
    MIM_XII:M

    -----Example Output-----
    1
    2

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.
    Example case 2:
    The magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.
    The magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.
