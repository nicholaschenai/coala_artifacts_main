He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.\nMr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.\nEg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5\nOnly Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.\nEach room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.\n- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.\n- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.\n\n-----Output:-----\nMaximum money obtained.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5\n- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4\n- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100\n- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 1\n3\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n12\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nFor the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. \nThis is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each room is initially locked, and only the two rooms at the ends can be unlocked first. He has a limited number of keys, and each key can unlock one room. Once a room is unlocked, he can unlock its adjacent rooms. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect using the given number of keys.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initial Access**: Mr. Krabs can start unlocking from either the leftmost or the rightmost room.\n2. **Unlocking Strategy**: After unlocking a room, he can only unlock its adjacent rooms.\n3. **Maximizing Money**: To maximize the money, Mr. Krabs should choose the sequence of rooms that yields the highest sum of money with the given number of keys.\n4. **Sliding Window Approach**: Use a sliding window technique to evaluate the maximum sum of money that can be collected by unlocking a contiguous sequence of rooms starting from either end.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize `max_money` to 0.\n2. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the left end.\n3. Calculate the sum of money for the first `k` rooms starting from the right end.\n4. Use a sliding window to adjust the sum by moving one room from the left end to the right end:\n   - For each possible split of keys between the left and right ends:\n     - Calculate the sum of money by taking some rooms from the left and the rest from the right.\n     - Update `max_money` if the current sum is greater.\n5. Output `max_money`.\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_money(n, A, k):\n    # Initialize the maximum money to 0\n    max_money = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the left\n    left_sum = sum(A[:k])\n    max_money = max(max_money, left_sum)\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the first k rooms from the right\n    right_sum = sum(A[-k:])\n    max_money = max(max_money, right_sum)\n    \n    # Use a sliding window to calculate the maximum money obtainable\n    # by taking some rooms from the left and the rest from the right\n    current_left_sum = 0\n    current_right_sum = sum(A[-k:])\n    \n    for i in range(k):\n        current_left_sum += A[i]\n        current_right_sum -= A[n - k + i]\n        current_sum = current_left_sum + current_right_sum\n        max_money = max(max_money, current_sum)\n    \n    return max_money\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nn = int(data[0])\nA = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\nk = int(data[n+1])\n\n# Output the result\nprint(max_money(n, A, k))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We first calculate the sum of the first `k` rooms from both the left and right ends.\n- We then use a sliding window approach to adjust the sum by moving one room from the left end to the right end, updating the maximum sum found.\n- The function `max_money` returns the maximum sum of money that can be collected with the given number of keys."

The core concept was to prioritize purchasing cheaper chocolates first to maximize the count, which is a classic example of a greedy algorithm.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Greedy Algorithm:** By sorting the prices in ascending order and purchasing the cheapest chocolates first, we ensure that we maximize the number of chocolates bought within the budget.\n    - **Input/Output Handling:** The problem required reading from standard input and writing to standard output, which is common in competitive programming and coding interviews.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Sorting:** Sorting the list of prices was crucial to implementing the greedy approach effectively.\n    - **Iterative Deduction:** Iterating through the sorted list and deducting each price from the budget until the budget could no longer cover the next chocolate was the main logic to solve the problem.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling:** Initially, the function was not called with the correct input format, which led to no output being detected. This was fixed by using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then parsing it appropriately.\n    - **Output:** Ensuring the result was printed to standard output was necessary for the solution to be evaluated correctly in the testing environment.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n        prices.sort()\n        count = 0\n        for price in prices:\n            if k >= price:\n                k -= price\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        return count\n\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    prices = list(map(int, data[2:]))\n    result = maxChocolates(n, k, prices)\n    print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of handling input/output correctly in coding challenges and the effectiveness of greedy algorithms in optimization problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Give me Chocolate\n\n        Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices.\n\n        Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money.\n\n        Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy? \n\n        For example, \n\n        if prices =[1,2,3,4]\n        and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items.\n\n        Input Format\n\n        The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend.\n\n        The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i]\n\n        Constraints\n\n        1<= n <= 105\n\n        1<= k <= 109\n\n        1<= prices[i] <= 109\n\n\n\n        A chocolate can't be bought multiple times.\n\n        Output Format\n\n        An integer that denotes the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy for her.\n\n        Sample Input\n\n        7 50\n\n        1 12 5 111 200 1000 10\n\n        Sample Output\n\n        4\n\n        Explanation\n\n        she can buy only 4 chocolatess at most. These chocolates have the following prices: 1, 12, 5, 10.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:\n\n        1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n           - We need to read input from standard input and output the result to standard output.\n           - The input consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers, `n` (number of chocolates) and `k` (amount of money Anushka has). The second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the prices of the chocolates.\n           - The output should be a single integer representing the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy.\n\n        2. **Where the Code Might Be Wrong:**\n           - The function `maxChocolates` is defined correctly, but it seems the function is not being called with the appropriate input.\n           - The code does not handle reading from standard input or writing to standard output, which is necessary for the environment to test the solution.\n\n        3. **Steps to Correct the Code:**\n           - Add code to read input from standard input.\n           - Parse the input to extract the number of chocolates, the amount of money, and the list of prices.\n           - Call the `maxChocolates` function with the parsed input.\n           - Print the result to standard output.\n\n        Let's update the code to include these steps:\n\n        ```python\n        def maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n            # Sort the prices in ascending order to buy cheaper chocolates first\n            prices.sort()\n    \n            # Initialize a counter for the number of chocolates bought\n            count = 0\n    \n            # Iterate over the sorted prices\n            for price in prices:\n                # Check if the current chocolate can be bought with the remaining money\n                if k >= price:\n                    # Deduct the price from the remaining money\n                    k -= price\n                    # Increment the count of chocolates bought\n                    count += 1\n                else:\n                    # If the current chocolate cannot be bought, stop the process\n                    break\n    \n            # Return the total number of chocolates bought\n            return count\n\n        # Read input from standard input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        # Parse the input\n        n = int(data[0])\n        k = int(data[1])\n        prices = list(map(int, data[2:]))\n\n        # Call the function and print the result\n        result = maxChocolates(n, k, prices)\n        print(result)\n        ```\n\n        This updated code will correctly read from standard input, process the data, and output the result, which should resolve the issue with the test environment.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's fix the solution by ensuring it reads from standard input and writes to standard output correctly. Here's the updated code:\n\n        ```python\n        def maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n            # Sort the prices in ascending order to buy cheaper chocolates first\n            prices.sort()\n    \n            # Initialize a counter for the number of chocolates bought\n            count = 0\n    \n            # Iterate over the sorted prices\n            for price in prices:\n                # Check if the current chocolate can be bought with the remaining money\n                if k >= price:\n                    # Deduct the price from the remaining money\n                    k -= price\n                    # Increment the count of chocolates bought\n                    count += 1\n                else:\n                    # If the current chocolate cannot be bought, stop the process\n                    break\n    \n            # Return the total number of chocolates bought\n            return count\n\n        # Read input from standard input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        # Parse the input\n        n = int(data[0])\n        k = int(data[1])\n        prices = list(map(int, data[2:]))\n\n        # Call the function and print the result\n        result = maxChocolates(n, k, prices)\n        print(result)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation:\n        - **Input Handling:** The code reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.\n        - **Parsing:** The first two elements are parsed as integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of chocolates and the amount of money Anushka has, respectively. The remaining elements are parsed as a list of integers representing the prices of the chocolates.\n        - **Function Call:** The `maxChocolates` function is called with the parsed inputs, and the result is printed to standard output. \n\n        This solution should now correctly handle input and output in the expected format for the testing environment.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['7 50', '1 12 5 111 200 1000 10'] Output: 4\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Give me Chocolate\n\n        Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices.\n\n        Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money.\n\n        Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy? \n\n        For example, \n\n        if prices =[1,2,3,4]\n        and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items.\n\n        Input Format\n\n        The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend.\n\n        The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i]\n\n        Constraints\n\n        1<= n <= 105\n\n        1<= k <= 109\n\n        1<= prices[i] <= 109\n\n\n\n        A chocolate can't be bought multiple times.\n\n        Output Format\n\n        An integer that denotes the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy for her.\n\n        Sample Input\n\n        7 50\n\n        1 12 5 111 200 1000 10\n\n        Sample Output\n\n        4\n\n        Explanation\n\n        she can buy only 4 chocolatess at most.

The solution involves calculating the maximum money obtainable from both starting points and choosing the better option.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n```\nfunction maxMoney(n, A, k):\n    # Calculate maximum money starting from the left\n    left_max = calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start=0, direction=1)\n    \n    # Calculate maximum money starting from the right\n    right_max = calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start=n-1, direction=-1)\n    \n    # Return the maximum of both strategies\n    return max(left_max, right_max)\n\nfunction calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start, direction):\n    # Initialize variables\n    money_collected = 0\n    keys_used = 0\n    current_position = start\n    unlocked_rooms = set()\n    \n    # Use a priority queue to always unlock the room with the most money\n    priority_queue = []\n    \n    # Unlock the starting room\n    unlocked_rooms.add(current_position)\n    priority_queue.push((-A[current_position], current_position))\n    \n    # While there are keys left and rooms to unlock\n    while keys_used < k and priority_queue is not empty:\n        # Get the room with the most money\n        money, room = priority_queue.pop()\n        money_collected += -money\n        keys_used += 1\n        \n        # Try to unlock adjacent rooms\n        for adjacent in [room + direction, room - direction]:\n            if 0 <= adjacent < n and adjacent not in unlocked_rooms:\n                unlocked_rooms.add(adjacent)\n                priority_queue.push((-A[adjacent], adjacent))\n    \n    return money_collected\n```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start, direction):\n    # Initialize variables\n    money_collected = 0\n    keys_used = 0\n    current_position = start\n    unlocked_rooms = set()\n    \n    # Use a list to simulate a priority queue (max-heap)\n    priority_queue = []\n    \n    # Unlock the starting room\n    unlocked_rooms.add(current_position)\n    priority_queue.append((-A[current_position], current_position))\n    \n    # While there are keys left and rooms to unlock\n    while keys_used < k and priority_queue:\n        # Sort the queue to simulate a max-heap\n        priority_queue.sort()\n        # Get the room with the most money\n        money, room = priority_queue.pop()\n        money_collected += -money\n        keys_used += 1\n        \n        # Try to unlock adjacent rooms\n        for adjacent in [room + direction, room - direction]:\n            if 0 <= adjacent < len(A) and adjacent not in unlocked_rooms:\n                unlocked_rooms.add(adjacent)\n                priority_queue.append((-A[adjacent], adjacent))\n    \n    return money_collected\n\ndef maxMoney(n, A, k):\n    # Calculate maximum money starting from the left\n    left_max = calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start=0, direction=1)\n    \n    # Calculate maximum money starting from the right\n    right_max = calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start=n-1, direction=-1)\n    \n    # Return the maximum of both strategies\n    return max(left_max, right_max)\n\n# Read input from standard input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse the input\nn = int(data[0])\nA = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\nk = int(data[n+1])\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = maxMoney(n, A, k)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the maximum money Mr. Krabs can collect by considering both possible starting points and using a greedy approach to unlock the most valuable rooms first."

The challenge was to determine the optimal strategy for unlocking rooms, given that only the rooms at the two ends could be initially accessed.\n\nThe solution involved a greedy approach, where the goal was to unlock rooms with the highest money values first. This was achieved by simulating a priority queue using a list to keep track of the most valuable rooms that could be unlocked next. The strategy was applied from both ends of the room sequence, and the maximum money collected from either strategy was chosen as the final result.\n\nKey insights included:\n- Using a max-heap (simulated with a sorted list) to always unlock the room with the most money.\n- Considering both possible starting points (leftmost and rightmost rooms) to ensure the optimal path was chosen.\n- Efficiently managing the unlocking process by keeping track of unlocked rooms and adjacent possibilities.\n\nThe solution was efficient and passed all tests, demonstrating the effectiveness of the greedy approach in this context. This problem reinforced the importance of exploring multiple starting points and using data structures like heaps to prioritize decisions based on value."

        "content": "The problem was an interesting exercise in maximizing a sum under constraints, specifically using a limited number of keys to unlock rooms in a linear sequence. My approach involved simulating a priority queue to always unlock the room with the most money, starting from either end of the row of rooms. This approach was effective and passed the test cases.\n\nThe official solution, however, takes a different approach by leveraging the properties of array slicing in Python. It calculates the sum of money that can be collected by considering different combinations of rooms from the two ends, using the available keys. The solution iterates over the number of keys and calculates the sum of money that can be collected by taking rooms from the end and the beginning of the list, effectively considering all possible combinations of rooms that can be unlocked with the given keys.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n- The use of array slicing to efficiently calculate sums of different segments of the list is a clever way to handle the problem without explicitly managing a priority queue.\n- The solution iterates over the number of keys and calculates potential sums by combining rooms from both ends, which is a straightforward and efficient way to explore all possible combinations.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more concise and leverages Python's slicing capabilities effectively, which is a useful technique to remember for similar problems involving contiguous subarrays or segments."

It uses a helper function to simulate unlocking rooms in a specified direction, either left to right or right to left, and collects money from the rooms with the highest amounts first. The function then compares the total money collected from both strategies and returns the maximum value. The input consists of the number of rooms `n`, a list `A` representing the money in each room, and the number of keys `k` available for unlocking rooms. The result is printed as the maximum money that can be collected using the optimal strategy.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to maximize a resource collection with limited access or actions. It applies to problems involving linear arrangements where access is restricted to endpoints, and each action (like using a key) allows further access to adjacent elements. This pattern is common in optimization problems, such as maximizing profits or resources in games, logistics, or network traversal where constraints limit the number of actions or movements. Understanding how to prioritize actions based on potential gain (using a max-heap or priority queue) is crucial in these scenarios."
