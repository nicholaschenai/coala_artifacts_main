    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\nMr. Krabs wants to steal the maximum amount of money from a series of rooms arranged in a row. Each room is locked, and he can only unlock a room if he has a key and if an adjacent room is already unlocked. He starts with a certain number of keys and can initially unlock only the rooms at the two ends of the row. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect by strategically using his keys.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\nTo maximize the money Mr. Krabs can collect, he should consider unlocking rooms in a way that maximizes the sum of money collected. Since he can only start from the two ends, he should explore both possibilities:\n- Start unlocking from the leftmost room and move right.\n- Start unlocking from the rightmost room and move left.\n\nFor each starting point, he should use the keys to unlock the rooms with the highest money values that are accessible. The solution involves calculating the maximum money obtainable from both starting points and choosing the better option.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n```\nfunction maxMoney(n, A, k):\n    # Calculate maximum money starting from the left\n    left_max = calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start=0, direction=1)\n    \n    # Calculate maximum money starting from the right\n    right_max = calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start=n-1, direction=-1)\n    \n    # Return the maximum of both strategies\n    return max(left_max, right_max)\n\nfunction calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start, direction):\n    # Initialize variables\n    money_collected = 0\n    keys_used = 0\n    current_position = start\n    unlocked_rooms = set()\n    \n    # Use a priority queue to always unlock the room with the most money\n    priority_queue = []\n    \n    # Unlock the starting room\n    unlocked_rooms.add(current_position)\n    priority_queue.push((-A[current_position], current_position))\n    \n    # While there are keys left and rooms to unlock\n    while keys_used < k and priority_queue is not empty:\n        # Get the room with the most money\n        money, room = priority_queue.pop()\n        money_collected += -money\n        keys_used += 1\n        \n        # Try to unlock adjacent rooms\n        for adjacent in [room + direction, room - direction]:\n            if 0 <= adjacent < n and adjacent not in unlocked_rooms:\n                unlocked_rooms.add(adjacent)\n                priority_queue.push((-A[adjacent], adjacent))\n    \n    return money_collected\n```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start, direction):\n    # Initialize variables\n    money_collected = 0\n    keys_used = 0\n    current_position = start\n    unlocked_rooms = set()\n    \n    # Use a list to simulate a priority queue (max-heap)\n    priority_queue = []\n    \n    # Unlock the starting room\n    unlocked_rooms.add(current_position)\n    priority_queue.append((-A[current_position], current_position))\n    \n    # While there are keys left and rooms to unlock\n    while keys_used < k and priority_queue:\n        # Sort the queue to simulate a max-heap\n        priority_queue.sort()\n        # Get the room with the most money\n        money, room = priority_queue.pop()\n        money_collected += -money\n        keys_used += 1\n        \n        # Try to unlock adjacent rooms\n        for adjacent in [room + direction, room - direction]:\n            if 0 <= adjacent < len(A) and adjacent not in unlocked_rooms:\n                unlocked_rooms.add(adjacent)\n                priority_queue.append((-A[adjacent], adjacent))\n    \n    return money_collected\n\ndef maxMoney(n, A, k):\n    # Calculate maximum money starting from the left\n    left_max = calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start=0, direction=1)\n    \n    # Calculate maximum money starting from the right\n    right_max = calculateMaxMoney(A, k, start=n-1, direction=-1)\n    \n    # Return the maximum of both strategies\n    return max(left_max, right_max)\n\n# Read input from standard input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse the input\nn = int(data[0])\nA = list(map(int, data[1:n+1]))\nk = int(data[n+1])\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = maxMoney(n, A, k)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the maximum money Mr. Krabs can collect by considering both possible starting points and using a greedy approach to unlock the most valuable rooms first.",
