The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.\nThe area is of dimension $N$ x $N$\nThe whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.\nThis is a SAFE example:\n1 0\n0 1\nThis is an UNSAFE example:\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nTo avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.\nReturn an output of \"SAFE\" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return \"UNSAFE\" otherwise.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\". An arrangement is considered \"SAFE\" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If any two beds are adjacent in any of these directions, the arrangement is \"UNSAFE\". We need to perform this check for multiple test cases.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. For each test case, read the grid dimensions \\( N \\) and the grid itself.\n2. For each cell in the grid that contains a bed (value 1), check its adjacent cells in all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).\n3.

Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n    #### Strategies and Missteps\n    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\n    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            count = 0\n            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n            k = 1\n            while k * k <= N:\n                count += 1\n                k += 1\n            results.append(count)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**\n    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n    **Initial Strategy:**\n    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\n    **Correct Strategy:**\n    The correct formula is:\n    \\[ \\text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\]\n    This formula:\n    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.\n    - Uses \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.\n    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.\n\n    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**\n    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n    **Final Code Snippet:**\n    ```python\n    def count_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return 12\n        else:\n            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = count_schedules(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        The  Chef  has bought $N$ boxes of Tiles.

Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. \n\n        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Mistake in the Solution\n\n        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N` is incorrect for this problem. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not the sum of the first k natural numbers. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * k <= N. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        Let's implement the correct logic:\n\n        ```python\n        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                count = 0\n                # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n                k = 1\n                while k * k <= N:\n                    count += 1\n                    k += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.\n        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is done using a simple loop.\n        - **Output Results**: For each test case, we print the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        This solution correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's correct the solution based on the insights from the problem analysis. The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N`. This is because the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is `k * (k + 1) / 2`, and we need to find the largest `k` such that this sum is less than or equal to `N`. This `k` will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        Here's the corrected Python code:\n\n        ```python\n        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                count = 0\n                # Find the largest k such that k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N\n                k = 1\n                while k * (k + 1) // 2 <= N:\n                    count += 1\n                    k += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.\n        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`.

        "content": "Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where the issue might be.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\nThe task is to determine if a grid of beds is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\". A grid is \"SAFE\" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The code should check each bed and ensure that none of its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) also contain a bed.\n\n### Code Review\n\n1. **Direction Check**: The code correctly defines the 8 possible directions to check for adjacent beds.\n2. **Grid Traversal**: The code iterates over each cell in the grid and checks for beds.\n3. **Adjacent Check**: For each bed found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent positions to see if any of them also contain a bed.\n\n### Issue Identification\n\nThe code logic seems correct in terms of checking adjacent cells. However, the test results indicate that the first test case is incorrectly marked as \"UNSAFE\" when it should be \"SAFE\". This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being processed or how the results are being stored and printed.\n\n### Potential Issues\n\n1. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read and parsed correctly. The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. The index management must be correct to parse each test case properly.\n2. **Result Storage**: Ensure that results are stored and printed correctly. The results list should store the result for each test case, and each result should be printed on a new line.\n\n### Debugging Steps\n\n1. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the logic for reading and parsing the input data. Ensure that the grid is being constructed correctly for each test case.\n2. **Check Result Logic**: Ensure that the results are being stored and printed correctly.\n\n### Revised Code\n\nLet's make sure the input parsing and result handling are correct:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(grid, N):\n    # Directions for all 8 possible adjacent positions\n    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]\n    \n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                for di, dj in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:\n                        return \"UNSAFE\"\n    return \"SAFE\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(N):\n            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            grid.append(row)\n        \n        result = is_safe(grid, N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Fixes\n\n- **Input Parsing**: Ensure that the grid is correctly constructed by slicing the input list with the correct indices.\n- **Result Handling**: Store each result in a list and print each result on a new line to match the expected output format.\n\nThis revised code should correctly handle the input and output, ensuring that each test case is processed independently and results are printed correctly."

The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n    **Initial Strategy:**\n    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\n    **Correct Strategy:**\n    The correct formula is:\n    \\[ \\text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\]\n    This formula:\n    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.\n    - Uses \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.\n    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.\n\n    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**\n    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n    **Final Code Snippet:**\n    ```python\n    def count_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return 12\n        else:\n            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = count_schedules(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n    #### Strategies and Missteps\n    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\n    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            count = 0\n            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n            k = 1\n            while k * k <= N:\n                count += 1\n                k += 1\n            results.append(count)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, K = test_case[0]\n            demands = test_case[1]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n            index += 2\n            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money.

A grid is \"SAFE\" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The code should check each bed and ensure that none of its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) also contain a bed.\n\n### Code Review\n\n1. **Direction Check**: The code correctly defines the 8 possible directions to check for adjacent beds.\n2. **Grid Traversal**: The code iterates over each cell in the grid and checks for beds.\n3. **Adjacent Check**: For each bed found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent positions to see if any of them also contain a bed.\n\n### Issue Identification\n\nThe logic for checking adjacent cells seems correct. However, the test results indicate that the first test case is incorrectly marked as \"UNSAFE\" when it should be \"SAFE\". This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being processed or how the results are being stored and printed.\n\n### Potential Issues\n\n1. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read and parsed correctly.

The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n    **Initial Strategy:**\n    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\n    **Correct Strategy:**\n    The correct formula is:\n    \\[ \\text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\]\n    This formula:\n    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.\n    - Uses \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.\n    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.\n\n    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**\n    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n    **Final Code Snippet:**\n    ```python\n    def count_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return 12\n        else:\n            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = count_schedules(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n    #### Strategies and Missteps\n    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\n    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            count = 0\n            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n            k = 1\n            while k * k <= N:\n                count += 1\n                k += 1\n            results.append(count)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left.

The key is to ensure that no two beds (represented by '1') are adjacent, including diagonally. This requires iterating over each cell in the grid and checking its 8 possible neighbors.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\nInitially, the strategy was to iterate over each cell and check all 8 directions for any adjacent beds. The logic for checking adjacency was implemented correctly, but the solution failed due to issues with input parsing and result handling.\n\n#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\nThe main issue was with input parsing. The input was read as a single string and split into a list, but the index management was not correctly handling the transition between test cases. This led to incorrect grid construction and, consequently, incorrect results. The solution involved carefully managing the index to ensure each grid was parsed correctly.\n\nAdditionally, ensuring that results were stored and printed correctly was crucial. Each test case result needed to be stored in a list and printed on a new line to match the expected output format.\n\n#### Final Thoughts\nThis problem highlighted the importance of careful input parsing and result management in competitive programming. Even when the core logic is correct, these peripheral issues can lead to incorrect results. Future attempts at similar problems should prioritize verifying input handling and output formatting early in the process."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task was to determine if a grid of beds is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\" based on adjacency rules. My initial approach correctly identified the need to check all 8 possible directions for adjacency, but the implementation had issues with input parsing and result handling.\n\n2. **Official Solution Approach**: The official solution simplifies the problem by focusing only on horizontal and vertical adjacency checks. It iterates through the grid to check for consecutive '1's in rows and columns, which is sufficient to determine if the grid is \"UNSAFE\". This approach is more efficient because it reduces unnecessary checks for diagonal adjacency, which are not required by the problem statement.\n\n3. **Key Differences**: \n   - **Efficiency**: The official solution is more efficient as it only checks necessary conditions (horizontal and vertical adjacency) rather than all 8 directions.\n   - **Input Handling**: The official solution uses straightforward input handling with a list of lists, which avoids the complexity of index management in a single list of strings.\n\n4. **Lessons Learned**: \n   - **Problem Constraints**: It's crucial to fully understand the problem constraints and requirements. The problem only required checking horizontal and vertical adjacency, not diagonal.\n   - **Simplifying the Approach**: Sometimes, a simpler approach that directly addresses the problem requirements can be more effective than a comprehensive but unnecessary solution.\n   - **Input Parsing**: Ensuring correct input parsing is fundamental to avoid logical errors in processing the data.\n\nIn future problem-solving scenarios, I will focus on understanding the problem constraints more thoroughly and aim for a solution that directly addresses the requirements without overcomplicating the logic."
