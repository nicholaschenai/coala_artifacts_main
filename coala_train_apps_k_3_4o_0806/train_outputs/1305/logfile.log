## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If any two beds are adjacent in any of these directions, the arrangement is "UNSAFE". We need to perform this check for multiple test cases.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each test case, read the grid dimensions \( N \) and the grid itself.
2. For each cell in the grid that contains a bed (value 1), check its adjacent cells in all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).
3. If any adjacent cell also contains a bed, mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE" and break out of the loop for that test case.
4. If no adjacent beds are found for any bed in the grid, mark the arrangement as "SAFE".
5. Repeat the above steps for all test cases and output the result for each.

## Pseudocode

```
function check_safety(grid, N):
    for each cell (i, j) in grid:
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
            for each direction (di, dj) in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)]:
                ni = i + di
                nj = j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                    return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read grid of size N x N
        result = check_safety(grid, N)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_safety(grid, N):
    # Directions for adjacent cells: right, down, left, up, and four diagonals
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all adjacent cells
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = check_safety(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case to determine if the bed arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE", and outputs the result for each test case. The `check_safety` function checks all possible adjacent positions for each bed to ensure no two beds are adjacent.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    **Initial Strategy:**
    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \( N \).

    **Correct Strategy:**
    The correct formula is:
    \[ \text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \]
    This formula:
    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.
    - Uses \( 3^{(N-2)} \) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.
    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.

    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.

    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

        ### Problem Analysis

        The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. 

        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.

        ### Mistake in the Solution

        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N` is incorrect for this problem. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not the sum of the first k natural numbers. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.

        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.

        ### Correct Approach

        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * k <= N. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        ### Revised Solution

        Let's implement the correct logic:

        ```python
        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for N in test_cases:
                count = 0
                # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
                k = 1
                while k * k <= N:
                    count += 1
                    k += 1
                results.append(count)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.
        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is done using a simple loop.
        - **Output Results**: For each test case, we print the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        This solution correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's correct the solution based on the insights from the problem analysis. The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N`. This is because the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is `k * (k + 1) / 2`, and we need to find the largest `k` such that this sum is less than or equal to `N`. This `k` will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        Here's the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for N in test_cases:
                count = 0
                # Find the largest k such that k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N
                k = 1
                while k * (k + 1) // 2 <= N:
                    count += 1
                    k += 1
                results.append(count)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

        if __name__ == "__main__":

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) and then the \( N \times N \) grid.
2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.
3. **Output**: If any adjacent beds are found, mark the grid as "UNSAFE". If no such pairs are found, mark it as "SAFE".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each row i from 0 to N-1:
        for each column j from 0 to N-1:
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all 8 possible adjacent positions
                for each (di, dj) in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():

    for each test case:

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where the issue might be.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The code should check each bed and ensure that none of its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) also contain a bed.

### Code Review

1. **Direction Check**: The code correctly defines the 8 possible directions to check for adjacent beds.
2. **Grid Traversal**: The code iterates over each cell in the grid and checks for beds.
3. **Adjacent Check**: For each bed found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent positions to see if any of them also contain a bed.

### Issue Identification

The code logic seems correct in terms of checking adjacent cells. However, the test results indicate that the first test case is incorrectly marked as "UNSAFE" when it should be "SAFE". This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being processed or how the results are being stored and printed.

### Potential Issues

1. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read and parsed correctly. The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. The index management must be correct to parse each test case properly.
2. **Result Storage**: Ensure that results are stored and printed correctly. The results list should store the result for each test case, and each result should be printed on a new line.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the logic for reading and parsing the input data. Ensure that the grid is being constructed correctly for each test case.
2. **Check Result Logic**: Ensure that the results are being stored and printed correctly.

### Revised Code

Let's make sure the input parsing and result handling are correct:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for all 8 possible adjacent positions
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Fixes

- **Input Parsing**: Ensure that the grid is correctly constructed by slicing the input list with the correct indices.
- **Result Handling**: Store each result in a list and print each result on a new line to match the expected output format.

This revised code should correctly handle the input and output, ensuring that each test case is processed independently and results are printed correctly.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) and then the \( N \times N \) grid.
2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.
3. **Output**: If any adjacent beds are found, mark the grid as "UNSAFE". If no such pairs are found, mark it as "SAFE".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each row i from 0 to N-1:
        for each column j from 0 to N-1:
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all 8 possible adjacent positions
                for each (di, dj) in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

### Final Python Code

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for all 8 possible adjacent positions
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"

### Explanation

- **is_safe Function**: This function checks each cell in the grid. If a bed is found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent cells. If any of these cells also contain a bed, the grid is marked as "UNSAFE".
- **main Function**: This function handles input and output. It reads the number of test cases, processes each grid, and prints whether it is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where the issue might be.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The code should check each bed and ensure that none of its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) also contain a bed.

### Code Review

1. **Direction Check**: The code correctly defines the 8 possible directions to check for adjacent beds.
2. **Grid Traversal**: The code iterates over each cell in the grid and checks for beds.
3. **Adjacent Check**: For each bed found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent positions to see if any of them also contain a bed.

### Issue Identification

The code logic seems correct in terms of checking adjacent cells. However, the test results indicate that the first test case is incorrectly marked as "UNSAFE" when it should be "SAFE". This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being processed or how the results are being stored and printed.

### Potential Issues

1. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read and parsed correctly. The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. The index management must be correct to parse each test case properly.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    **Initial Strategy:**
    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \( N \).

    **Correct Strategy:**
    The correct formula is:
    \[ \text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \]
    This formula:
    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.
    - Uses \( 3^{(N-2)} \) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.
    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.

    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) and then the \( N \times N \) grid.
2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.
3. **Output**: If any adjacent beds are found, mark the grid as "UNSAFE". If no such pairs are found, mark it as "SAFE".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each row i from 0 to N-1:
        for each column j from 0 to N-1:
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all 8 possible adjacent positions
                for each (di, dj) in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

### Explanation

- **is_safe Function**: This function checks each cell in the grid. If a bed is found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent cells. If any of these cells also contain a bed, the grid is marked as "UNSAFE".
- **main Function**: This function handles input and output. It reads the number of test cases, processes each grid, and prints whether it is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where the issue might be.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The code should check each bed and ensure that none of its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) also contain a bed.

### Code Review

1. **Direction Check**: The code correctly defines the 8 possible directions to check for adjacent beds.
2. **Grid Traversal**: The code iterates over each cell in the grid and checks for beds.
3. **Adjacent Check**: For each bed found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent positions to see if any of them also contain a bed.

### Issue Identification

The code logic seems correct in terms of checking adjacent cells. However, the test results indicate that the first test case is incorrectly marked as "UNSAFE" when it should be "SAFE". This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being processed or how the results are being stored and printed.

### Potential Issues

1. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read and parsed correctly. The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. The index management must be correct to parse each test case properly.
2. **Result Storage**: Ensure that results are stored and printed correctly. The results list should store the result for each test case, and each result should be printed on a new line.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the logic for reading and parsing the input data. Ensure that the grid is being constructed correctly for each test case.
2. **Check Result Logic**: Ensure that the results are being stored and printed correctly.

### Revised Code

Let's make sure the input parsing and result handling are correct:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for all 8 possible adjacent positions
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where the issue might be.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The code should check each bed and ensure that none of its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) also contain a bed.

### Code Review

1. **Direction Check**: The code correctly defines the 8 possible directions to check for adjacent beds.
2. **Grid Traversal**: The code iterates over each cell in the grid and checks for beds.
3. **Adjacent Check**: For each bed found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent positions to see if any of them also contain a bed.

### Issue Identification

The code logic seems correct in terms of checking adjacent cells. However, the test results indicate that the first test case is incorrectly marked as "UNSAFE" when it should be "SAFE". This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being processed or how the results are being stored and printed.

### Potential Issues

1. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read and parsed correctly. The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. The index management must be correct to parse each test case properly.
2. **Result Storage**: Ensure that results are stored and printed correctly. The results list should store the result for each test case, and each result should be printed on a new line.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the logic for reading and parsing the input data. Ensure that the grid is being constructed correctly for each test case.
2. **Check Result Logic**: Ensure that the results are being stored and printed correctly.

### Revised Code

Let's make sure the input parsing and result handling are correct:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for all 8 possible adjacent positions
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Fixes

- **Input Parsing**: Ensure that the grid is correctly constructed by slicing the input list with the correct indices.
- **Result Handling**: Store each result in a list and print each result on a new line to match the expected output format.

This revised code should correctly handle the input and output, ensuring that each test case is processed independently and results are printed correctly.

The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) and then the \( N \times N \) grid.
2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.
3. **Output**: If any adjacent beds are found, mark the grid as "UNSAFE". If no such pairs are found, mark it as "SAFE".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each row i from 0 to N-1:
        for each column j from 0 to N-1:
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all 8 possible adjacent positions
                for each (di, dj) in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being processed or how the results are being stored and printed.

### Potential Issues

1. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read and parsed correctly. The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. The index management must be correct to parse each test case properly.
2. **Result Storage**: Ensure that results are stored and printed correctly. The results list should store the result for each test case, and each result should be printed on a new line.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the logic for reading and parsing the input data. Ensure that the grid is being constructed correctly for each test case.
2. **Check Result Logic**: Ensure that the results are being stored and printed correctly.

### Revised Code

Let's make sure the input parsing and result handling are correct:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for all 8 possible adjacent positions
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                for di, dj in directions:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            row = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            grid.append(row)
        
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Fixes

- **Input Parsing**: Ensure that the grid is correctly constructed by slicing the input list with the correct indices.
- **Result Handling**: Store each result in a list and print each result on a new line to match the expected output format.

This revised code should correctly handle the input and output, ensuring that each test case is processed independently and results are printed correctly.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    **Initial Strategy:**
    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \( N \).

    **Correct Strategy:**
    The correct formula is:
    \[ \text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \]
    This formula:
    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.
    - Uses \( 3^{(N-2)} \) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.
    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.

    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) and then the \( N \times N \) grid.
2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.
3. **Output**: If any adjacent beds are found, mark the grid as "UNSAFE". If no such pairs are found, mark it as "SAFE".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each row i from 0 to N-1:
        for each column j from 0 to N-1:
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all 8 possible adjacent positions
                for each (di, dj) in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid

### Explanation

- **is_safe Function**: This function checks each cell in the grid. If a bed is found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent cells. If any of these cells also contain a bed, the grid is marked as "UNSAFE".
- **main Function**: This function handles input and output. It reads the number of test cases, processes each grid, and prints whether it is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where the issue might be.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The code should check each bed and ensure that none of its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) also contain a bed.

### Code Review

1. **Direction Check**: The code correctly defines the 8 possible directions to check for adjacent beds.
2. **Grid Traversal**: The code iterates over each cell in the grid and checks for beds.
3. **Adjacent Check**: For each bed found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent positions to see if any of them also contain a bed.

### Issue Identification

The code logic seems correct in terms of checking adjacent cells. However, the test results indicate that the first test case is incorrectly marked as "UNSAFE" when it should be "SAFE". This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being processed or how the results are being stored and printed.

### Potential Issues

1. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read and parsed correctly. The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. The index management must be correct to parse each test case properly.
2. **Result Storage**: Ensure that results are stored and printed correctly. The results list should store the result for each test case, and each result should be printed on a new line.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the logic for reading and parsing the input data. Ensure that the grid is being constructed correctly for each test case.
2. **Check Result Logic**: Ensure that the results are being stored and printed correctly.

### Revised Code

Let's make sure the input parsing and result handling are correct:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for all 8 possible adjacent positions
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) and then the \( N \times N \) grid.
2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.
3. **Output**: If any adjacent beds are found, mark the grid as "UNSAFE". If no such pairs are found, mark it as "SAFE".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each row i from 0 to N-1:
        for each column j from 0 to N-1:
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all 8 possible adjacent positions
                for each (di, dj) in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

### Final Python Code

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for all 8 possible adjacent positions
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

### Explanation

- **is_safe Function**: This function checks each cell in the grid. If a bed is found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent cells. If any of these cells also contain a bed, the grid is marked as "UNSAFE".
- **main Function**: This function handles input and output. It reads the number of test cases, processes each grid, and prints whether it is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where the issue might be.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The code should check each bed and ensure that none of its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) also contain a bed.

### Code Review

1. **Direction Check**: The code correctly defines the 8 possible directions to check for adjacent beds.
2. **Grid Traversal**: The code iterates over each cell in the grid and checks for beds.
3. **Adjacent Check**: For each bed found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent positions to see if any of them also contain a bed.

### Issue Identification

The code logic seems correct in terms of checking adjacent cells. However, the test results indicate that the first test case is incorrectly marked as "UNSAFE" when it should be "SAFE". This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being processed or how the results are being stored and printed.

### Potential Issues

1. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read and parsed correctly. The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. The index management must be correct to parse each test case properly.
2. **Result Storage**: Ensure that results are stored and printed correctly. The results list should store the result for each test case, and each result should be printed on a new line.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the logic for reading and parsing the input data. Ensure that the grid is being constructed correctly for each test case.
2. **Check Result Logic**: Ensure that the results are being stored and printed correctly.

### Revised Code

Let's make sure the input parsing and result handling are correct:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for all 8 possible adjacent positions
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    **Initial Strategy:**
    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \( N \).

    **Correct Strategy:**
    The correct formula is:
    \[ \text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \]
    This formula:
    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.
    - Uses \( 3^{(N-2)} \) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.
    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.

    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) and then the \( N \times N \) grid.
2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.
3. **Output**: If any adjacent beds are found, mark the grid as "UNSAFE". If no such pairs are found, mark it as "SAFE".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each row i from 0 to N-1:
        for each column j from 0 to N-1:
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all 8 possible adjacent positions
                for each (di, dj) in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T

### Explanation

- **is_safe Function**: This function checks each cell in the grid. If a bed is found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent cells. If any of these cells also contain a bed, the grid is marked as "UNSAFE".
- **main Function**: This function handles input and output. It reads the number of test cases, processes each grid, and prints whether it is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where the issue might be.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The code should check each bed and ensure that none of its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) also contain a bed.

### Code Review

1. **Direction Check**: The code correctly defines the 8 possible directions to check for adjacent beds.
2. **Grid Traversal**: The code iterates over each cell in the grid and checks for beds.
3. **Adjacent Check**: For each bed found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent positions to see if any of them also contain a bed.

### Issue Identification

The code logic seems correct in terms of checking adjacent cells. However, the test results indicate that the first test case is incorrectly marked as "UNSAFE" when it should be "SAFE". This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being processed or how the results are being stored and printed.

### Potential Issues

1. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read and parsed correctly. The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. The index management must be correct to parse each test case properly.
2. **Result Storage**: Ensure that results are stored and printed correctly. The results list should store the result for each test case, and each result should be printed on a new line.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the logic for reading and parsing the input data. Ensure that the grid is being constructed correctly for each test case.
2. **Check Result Logic**: Ensure that the results are being stored and printed correctly.

### Revised Code

Let's make sure the input parsing and result handling are correct:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for all 8 possible adjacent positions
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the "SAFE" vs "UNSAFE" Grid Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem revolves around checking adjacency in a grid, which is a common pattern in grid-based problems. The key is to ensure that no two beds (represented by '1') are adjacent, including diagonally. This requires iterating over each cell in the grid and checking its 8 possible neighbors.

#### Strategies and Challenges
Initially, the strategy was to iterate over each cell and check all 8 directions for any adjacent beds. The logic for checking adjacency was implemented correctly, but the solution failed due to issues with input parsing and result handling.

#### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
The main issue was with input parsing. The input was read as a single string and split into a list, but the index management was not correctly handling the transition between test cases. This led to incorrect grid construction and, consequently, incorrect results. The solution involved carefully managing the index to ensure each grid was parsed correctly.

Additionally, ensuring that results were stored and printed correctly was crucial. Each test case result needed to be stored in a list and printed on a new line to match the expected output format.

#### Final Thoughts
This problem highlighted the importance of careful input parsing and result management in competitive programming. Even when the core logic is correct, these peripheral issues can lead to incorrect results. Future attempts at similar problems should prioritize verifying input handling and output formatting early in the process.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1

To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a grid of size \( N \times N \) where each cell can either have a bed (denoted by 1) or be empty (denoted by 0). The task is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. We need to check multiple test cases and output "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" for each.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases \( T \). For each test case, read the size \( N \) and then the \( N \times N \) grid.
2. **Safety Check**: For each grid, check every cell that contains a bed (1). Ensure that no adjacent cell (including diagonals) also contains a bed.
3. **Output**: If any adjacent beds are found, mark the grid as "UNSAFE". If no such pairs are found, mark it as "SAFE".

### Pseudocode

```
function is_safe(grid, N):
    for each row i from 0 to N-1:
        for each column j from 0 to N-1:
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                # Check all 8 possible adjacent positions
                for each (di, dj) in [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]:
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        read the N x N grid
        result = is_safe(grid, N)
        print(result)
```

### Explanation

- **is_safe Function**: This function checks each cell in the grid. If a bed is found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent cells. If any of these cells also contain a bed, the grid is marked as "UNSAFE".
- **main Function**: This function handles input and output. It reads the number of test cases, processes each grid, and prints whether it is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE".

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the code to identify where the issue might be.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". A grid is "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent, including diagonally. The code should check each bed and ensure that none of its 8 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) also contain a bed.

### Code Review

1. **Direction Check**: The code correctly defines the 8 possible directions to check for adjacent beds.
2. **Grid Traversal**: The code iterates over each cell in the grid and checks for beds.
3. **Adjacent Check**: For each bed found, it checks all 8 possible adjacent positions to see if any of them also contain a bed.

### Issue Identification

The code logic seems correct in terms of checking adjacent cells. However, the test results indicate that the first test case is incorrectly marked as "UNSAFE" when it should be "SAFE". This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being processed or how the results are being stored and printed.

### Potential Issues

1. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is being read and parsed correctly. The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. The index management must be correct to parse each test case properly.
2. **Result Storage**: Ensure that results are stored and printed correctly. The results list should store the result for each test case, and each result should be printed on a new line.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the logic for reading and parsing the input data. Ensure that the grid is being constructed correctly for each test case.
2. **Check Result Logic**: Ensure that the results are being stored and printed correctly.

### Revised Code

Let's make sure the input parsing and result handling are correct:

```python
def is_safe(grid, N):
    # Directions for all 8 possible adjacent positions
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

                        return "UNSAFE"
    return "SAFE"

### Explanation of Fixes

- **Input Parsing**: The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings. We ensure that the grid is correctly constructed by slicing the input list with the correct indices.
- **Result Handling**: Each result is stored in a list and printed on a new line to match the expected output format.

This code should correctly handle the input and output, ensuring that each test case is processed independently and results are printed correctly.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task was to determine if a grid of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on adjacency rules. My initial approach correctly identified the need to check all 8 possible directions for adjacency, but the implementation had issues with input parsing and result handling.

2. **Official Solution Approach**: The official solution simplifies the problem by focusing only on horizontal and vertical adjacency checks. It iterates through the grid to check for consecutive '1's in rows and columns, which is sufficient to determine if the grid is "UNSAFE". This approach is more efficient because it reduces unnecessary checks for diagonal adjacency, which are not required by the problem statement.

3. **Key Differences**: 
   - **Efficiency**: The official solution is more efficient as it only checks necessary conditions (horizontal and vertical adjacency) rather than all 8 directions.
   - **Input Handling**: The official solution uses straightforward input handling with a list of lists, which avoids the complexity of index management in a single list of strings.

4. **Lessons Learned**: 
   - **Problem Constraints**: It's crucial to fully understand the problem constraints and requirements. The problem only required checking horizontal and vertical adjacency, not diagonal.
   - **Simplifying the Approach**: Sometimes, a simpler approach that directly addresses the problem requirements can be more effective than a comprehensive but unnecessary solution.
   - **Input Parsing**: Ensuring correct input parsing is fundamental to avoid logical errors in processing the data.

In future problem-solving scenarios, I will focus on understanding the problem constraints more thoroughly and aim for a solution that directly addresses the requirements without overcomplicating the logic.
