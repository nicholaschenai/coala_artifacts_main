    "raw_msg": "Let's address the problem by carefully analyzing the pattern and ensuring the code correctly implements the required logic. The task is to generate a pattern for each test case based on the integer \\( K \\). For each test case, we need to print \\( K \\) lines, where each line \\( i \\) (0-indexed) contains the string \"10\" repeated \\( i+1 \\) times.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    # Read each test case value\n    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n    # For each test case\n    for K in test_cases:\n        # Generate K lines\n        for i in range(K):\n            # Start with \"1\" and alternate between \"0\" and \"1\"\n            line = ''.join('1' if j % 2 == 0 else '0' for j in range(i + 1))\n            # Print the line\n            print(line)\n\n# Call the function to execute the pattern generation\ngenerate_pattern()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the number of test cases \\( T \\) is extracted. Each test case value \\( K \\) is stored in a list `test_cases`.\n- **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, iterate from 0 to \\( K-1 \\) to generate each line of the pattern. For each line \\( i \\), generate a string that starts with \"1\" and alternates between \"0\" and \"1\" for \\( i+1 \\) characters.\n- **Output**: Each line is printed immediately after it is constructed. This ensures that the output format matches the expected pattern for each test case.",
