    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, with a specified output node. Each input node can be set to 1 with a probability `p` and to 0 with a probability `1-p`. We need to find the value of `p` such that the output node has a probability of 1/2 of being 1.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Circuit**: Each node in the circuit is either an input node or a gate (AND or OR). The gates take inputs from previous nodes and produce an output based on their logic.\n\n2. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - For an input node, the probability of being 1 is `p`.\n   - For an OR gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) + P(b) - P(a) * P(b)`.\n   - For an AND gate with inputs `a` and `b`, the probability of output being 1 is `P(a) * P(b)`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for `p`**: We need to find the value of `p` such that the probability of the output node being 1 is exactly 0.5. This can be efficiently done using binary search over the range [0, 1].\n\n4. **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, parse the circuit description, compute the probability of the output node being 1 for a given `p`, and adjust `p` using binary search until the desired probability is achieved.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):\n    probabilities = [0] * n\n    for i from 0 to n-1:\n        if nodes[i] is input:\n            probabilities[i] = p\n        else if nodes[i] is OR gate:\n            a, b = nodes[i].inputs\n            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] + probabilities[b] - probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n        else if nodes[i] is AND gate:\n            a, b = nodes[i].inputs\n            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n    return probabilities[n-1]\n\nfunction find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes):\n    low = 0.0\n    high = 1.0\n    while high - low > 1e-6:\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if calculate_probability(n, nodes, mid) < 0.5:\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return (low + high) / 2\n\nfunction main():\n    read number of test cases\n    for each test case:\n        read n\n        read nodes\n        p = find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes)\n        print p formatted to 5 decimal places\n```\n\n### Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_probability(n, nodes, p):\n    probabilities = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if nodes[i][0] == 0:  # Input node\n            probabilities[i] = p\n        elif nodes[i][0] == 1:  # OR gate\n            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]\n            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] + probabilities[b] - probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:  # AND gate\n            a, b = nodes[i][1], nodes[i][2]\n            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n    return probabilities[n-1]\n\ndef find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes):\n    low = 0.0\n    high = 1.0\n    while high - low > 1e-6:\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if calculate_probability(n, nodes, mid) < 0.5:\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return (low + high) / 2\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split('\\n')\n    \n    index = 0\n    num_cases = int(data[index].strip())\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    for _ in range(num_cases):\n        if data[index].strip() == \"\":\n            index += 1\n        n = int(data[index].strip())\n        index += 1\n        nodes = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            nodes.append(list(map(int, data[index].strip().split())))\n            index += 1\n        p = find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes)\n        results.append(f\"{p:.5f}\")\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes each test case, and uses binary search to find the probability `p` that makes the output node have a probability of 1/2 of being 1.
