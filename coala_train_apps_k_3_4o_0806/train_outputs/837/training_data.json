    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number N for multiple test cases. The core concept here was recognizing that these multiples form an arithmetic series, which can be efficiently summed using a mathematical formula rather than iterating through each number.\n\nKey steps included:\n1. **Identifying the Largest Multiple**: For a given N, the largest multiple of 10 is calculated as \\( m = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{N}{10} \\right\\rfloor \\times 10 \\).\n2. **Using the Arithmetic Series Formula**: The sum of the series can be computed using the formula \\( \\text{Sum} = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (10 + m) \\), where \\( k \\) is the number of terms, \\( k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{N}{10} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\nThe solution was implemented in a function `sum_of_multiples_of_10` that encapsulates this logic, and a `main` function that handles input and output. The approach was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues, demonstrating the power of mathematical formulas in simplifying and optimizing computations. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sequences and leveraging mathematical properties for efficient problem-solving.",
    "reflection": "The problem was straightforward, and my solution was similar to the official one, both in logic and efficiency. However, the official solution uses a slightly different approach to calculate the sum of multiples of 10, which is worth noting for its simplicity.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Simplified Calculation**:\n   - The official solution directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N by adjusting N with `n -= n % 10`.\n   - It then divides by 10 to get the number of terms `n` in the series.\n\n2. **Direct Use of Arithmetic Series Formula**:\n   - The formula used is `n * (n + 1) / 2 * 10`, which directly computes the sum of the series without explicitly calculating the last term `m` as in my solution.\n   - This approach is concise and leverages the arithmetic series formula effectively.\n\n3. **Efficiency**:\n   - Both solutions are efficient with a time complexity of O(1) per test case, as they involve simple arithmetic operations.\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThe official solution is a good reminder of how sometimes a direct approach can be more elegant and concise. It simplifies the calculation by reducing the number of steps and variables involved. This experience reinforces the importance of revisiting mathematical formulas and leveraging them directly when possible to simplify code.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases, followed by T integers. For each integer N, it calculates the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to N using a helper function. It stores the results for each test case in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to calculate the sum of a series of numbers that are multiples of a specific number, up to a certain limit. This is common in mathematical problems involving arithmetic series, especially when dealing with large numbers where efficiency is important to avoid integer overflow. The solution uses a formula to calculate the sum of multiples of 10 efficiently, which can be adapted to other multiples by changing the base multiple. This approach is particularly useful in competitive programming and algorithm design, where constraints on time and space complexity are critical."
