INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a different value of "N". We need to output the sum for each test case on a new line.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   For each test case:
   - Identify all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to "N".
   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence: 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N.
   - The largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N can be found by calculating `N // 10 * 10`.
   - The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{Number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{First term} + \text{Last term})
     \]
   - The first term is 10, and the last term is the largest multiple of 10 â‰¤ N.
   - The number of terms is the largest multiple of 10 divided by 10.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read the number of test cases, T
   For each test case:
       Read the integer N
       Calculate the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N: max_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
       Calculate the number of terms: num_terms = max_multiple // 10
       Calculate the sum using the arithmetic sequence formula:
           sum = (num_terms / 2) * (10 + max_multiple)
       Print the sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    
    results = []
    
    # Process each test case
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        # Read the integer N for the current test case
        N = int(data[i])
        
        # Calculate the largest multiple of 10 that is â‰¤ N
        max_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
        
        # Calculate the number of terms in the sequence
        num_terms = max_multiple // 10
        
        # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence
        # First term is 10, last term is max_multiple
        sum_multiples = (num_terms * (10 + max_multiple)) // 2
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(sum_multiples)
    
    # Output all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads input from standard input, processes each test case to calculate the sum of multiples of 10 up to N, and prints the result for each test case. The arithmetic sequence formula is used to efficiently compute the sum.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer N, and we need to output the N'th number in the series.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
           - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
           - The differences between consecutive terms are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
           - These differences are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

        2. **Formulate the Series**:
           - The N'th term can be expressed as a sum of squares: 
             - \( S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + (N-1)^2 \)
           - This is a known mathematical series where the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers is given by:
             - \( S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \)

        3. **Plan the Solution**:
           - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula for the sum of squares.
           - Output the result for each test case.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function calculate_nth_term(N):
            return (N-1) * N * (2*N-1) // 6

        function main():
            read T
            for each test case:
                read N
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                print result
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def calculate_nth_term(N):
            # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                result = calculate_nth_term(N)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **calculate_nth_term**: This function computes the N'th term in the series using the formula for the sum of squares.
        - **main**: This function handles input and output. It reads all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints, and processes each test case to compute and print the result.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

        At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
        This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
        Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
        - Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
        - $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
        - $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        Initial score of students will be : $[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$
        after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 50, 50, 10, 10]$
        after solving question 2 scores will be: $[50, 100, 100, 20, 20]$
        after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 100, 700, 140, 20]$
        Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will $(50+100+700+140+20)/5 = 202$

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the `main()` function, which contains the logic for reading input and producing output, is not being executed. In Python scripts, especially when using functions, it's crucial to ensure that the main logic is called when the script is executed.

        ### Steps to Identify the Problem

        1. **Check Function Execution**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script. Without this call, the script will define the functions but never execute them.
        2. **Input/Output Handling**: Verify that the input is being read correctly and that the output is being printed as expected.
        3. **Index Management**: Ensure that the index used to parse the input data is managed correctly to avoid any off-by-one errors or incorrect data parsing.

        ### Correction Steps

        1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Add a call to the `main()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        2. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the input parsing logic to ensure that it correctly handles the input format and constraints.

        ### Revised Solution

        ```python
        def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
            # Initialize scores for each student
            scores = [10] * N
    
            # Process each question
            for i, j, k in questions:
                for student in range(i, j + 1):
                    scores[student] *= k
    
            # Calculate the mean of the scores
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
            return mean_score

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                M = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                questions = []
                for _ in range(M):
                    i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
                    j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
                    k = int(data[index + 2])
                    index += 3
                    questions.append((i, j, k))
        
                result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Ensure the main function is called
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Function Call**: The `main()` function is now called when the script is executed, ensuring that the input is read and processed, and the output is printed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, split into a list of strings, and parsed using an index to handle multiple test cases efficiently.
        - **Output**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed at the end. This ensures that all outputs are correctly displayed.

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer N, and we need to output the sum of these multiples for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Multiples of 10**:
   - Multiples of 10 are numbers like 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N.

2. **Calculate the Sum**:
   - If N is 10, the multiples are [10].
   - If N is 20, the multiples are [10, 20].
   - The sum of these multiples can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

3. **Arithmetic Series Formula**:
   - The multiples of 10 up to N form an arithmetic series: 10, 20, 30, ..., m.
   - The last term m is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, which is \( m = \left\lfloor \frac{N}{10} \right\rfloor \times 10 \).
   - The number of terms in this series is \( k = \left\lfloor \frac{N}{10} \right\rfloor \).
   - The sum of the series is given by the formula: \( \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (10 + m) \).

4. **Plan the Solution**:
   - For each test case, calculate the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N.
   - Use the arithmetic series formula to compute the sum of these multiples.
   - Output the result for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    m = (N // 10) * 10
    k = N // 10

        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number N for multiple test cases. The core concept here was recognizing that these multiples form an arithmetic series, which can be efficiently summed using a mathematical formula rather than iterating through each number.

Key steps included:
1. **Identifying the Largest Multiple**: For a given N, the largest multiple of 10 is calculated as \( m = \left\lfloor \frac{N}{10} \right\rfloor \times 10 \).
2. **Using the Arithmetic Series Formula**: The sum of the series can be computed using the formula \( \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (10 + m) \), where \( k \) is the number of terms, \( k = \left\lfloor \frac{N}{10} \right\rfloor \).

The solution was implemented in a function `sum_of_multiples_of_10` that encapsulates this logic, and a `main` function that handles input and output. The approach was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues, demonstrating the power of mathematical formulas in simplifying and optimizing computations. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sequences and leveraging mathematical properties for efficient problem-solving.

   - The number of terms in this series is \( k = \left\lfloor \frac{N}{10} \right\rfloor \).
   - The sum of the series is given by the formula: \( \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (10 + m) \).

4. **Plan the Solution**:
   - For each test case, calculate the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N.
   - Use the arithmetic series formula to compute the sum of these multiples.
   - Output the result for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    m = (N // 10) * 10
    k = N // 10
    return (k * (10 + m)) // 2

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
        print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    # Calculate the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N
    m = (N // 10) * 10
    # Calculate the number of terms in the series
    k = N // 10
    # Calculate the sum of the series
    return (k * (10 + m)) // 2

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for t in range(eval(input())):
 n=eval(input())
 n-=n%10
 n/=10
 print(n*(n+1)/2*10)

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution was similar to the official one, both in logic and efficiency. However, the official solution uses a slightly different approach to calculate the sum of multiples of 10, which is worth noting for its simplicity.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Simplified Calculation**:
   - The official solution directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N by adjusting N with `n -= n % 10`.
   - It then divides by 10 to get the number of terms `n` in the series.

2. **Direct Use of Arithmetic Series Formula**:
   - The formula used is `n * (n + 1) / 2 * 10`, which directly computes the sum of the series without explicitly calculating the last term `m` as in my solution.
   - This approach is concise and leverages the arithmetic series formula effectively.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Both solutions are efficient with a time complexity of O(1) per test case, as they involve simple arithmetic operations.

### Reflection:

The official solution is a good reminder of how sometimes a direct approach can be more elegant and concise. It simplifies the calculation by reducing the number of steps and variables involved. This experience reinforces the importance of revisiting mathematical formulas and leveraging them directly when possible to simplify code.
