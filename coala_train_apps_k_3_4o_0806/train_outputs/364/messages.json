You can fill a jug, empty a jug, or pour water from one jug to another until one is full or the other is empty. The goal is to see if you can end up with exactly `z` liters in one or both jugs.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nThe problem is a classic example of the \"water jug problem,\" which can be solved using the mathematical concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The key insight is that you can measure exactly `z` liters if and only if `z` is a multiple of the GCD of `x` and `y`, and `z` is less than or equal to the sum of `x` and `y`.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Check if `z` is greater than the sum of `x` and `y`:** If `z` is greater than `x + y`, it's impossible to measure `z` liters because the total capacity of both jugs is insufficient.\n\n2. **Calculate the GCD of `x` and `y`:** Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of `x` and `y`.\n\n3. **Check if `z` is a multiple of the GCD:** If `z` is a multiple of the GCD, then it is possible to measure `z` liters using the jugs.\n\n4. **Return the result:** If both conditions are satisfied, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction canMeasureWater(x, y, z):\n    if z > x + y:\n        return False\n    \n    gcd = calculateGCD(x, y)\n    \n    if z % gcd == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nfunction calculateGCD(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        temp = b\n        b = a % b\n        a = temp\n    return a\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def canMeasureWater(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> bool:\n        # Helper function to calculate the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm\n        def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n            while b != 0:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n        \n        # If z is greater than the total capacity of both jugs, it's impossible\n        if z > x + y:\n            return False\n        \n        # Calculate the GCD of x and y\n        gcd_value = gcd(x, y)\n        \n        # Check if z is a multiple of the GCD\n        return z % gcd_value == 0\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently determines if it's possible to measure exactly `z` liters using the two jugs by leveraging the properties of the GCD."

The key mathematical concept involved was calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of three numbers, which represents the interval at which all groups coincide.\n\n    The strategy that worked was to:\n    1. Calculate the total number of hours over the given days (`N * 24`).\n    2. Compute the LCM of the three visit frequencies (`x`, `y`, `z`) using the greatest common divisor (GCD) as a helper function.\n    3. Determine how many times this LCM fits into the total hours to find the number of simultaneous visits.\n\n    The solution involved implementing the Euclidean algorithm for GCD and using it to compute the LCM. This approach efficiently handled the constraints, especially with large values for `N`, by focusing on the mathematical properties of LCM rather than simulating each hour.\n\n    The problem was straightforward once the mathematical approach was clear, and no unexpected errors occurred during implementation.
