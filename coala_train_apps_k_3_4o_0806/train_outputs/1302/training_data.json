    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n#### Strategies and Missteps\nInitially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\nThe correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n#### Correct Solution\nThe correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\n```python\ndef count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for N in test_cases:\n        count = 0\n        # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n        k = 1\n        while k * k <= N:\n            count += 1\n            k += 1\n        results.append(count)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n    count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem required determining how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, with each room in one house paired with a room in the other house. My initial approach misunderstood the problem's requirements, leading to incorrect logic and conditions. I was trying to find the largest `k` such that `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N`, which was not aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The official solution correctly interprets the problem by realizing that for a room of size `i*i`, we need `2 * i * i` tiles to tile two rooms completely. The task is to find the number of such `i` values that satisfy this condition.\n\n2. **Simplified Calculation**: The official solution simplifies the problem by dividing `N` by 2, which directly relates to the number of tiles needed for two rooms. It then calculates the largest integer `k` such that `2 * k^2 <= N`, which is effectively finding `k = 2 * int((N/2)^0.5)`.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient, using mathematical operations to directly compute the result without iterative checks, which is crucial given the constraints (with `N` up to `10^12`).\n\n#### Lessons Learned:\n\n- **Problem Interpretation**: It's crucial to thoroughly understand the problem statement and constraints before diving into a solution. Misinterpretation can lead to incorrect logic and wasted effort.\n  \n- **Mathematical Insight**: Sometimes, problems that seem complex can be simplified significantly with the right mathematical insight, reducing computational complexity and improving efficiency.\n\n- **Efficiency in Large Constraints**: For problems with large constraints, direct computation using mathematical formulas is often more efficient than iterative approaches. This is especially true when the problem can be reduced to a simple mathematical expression.",
