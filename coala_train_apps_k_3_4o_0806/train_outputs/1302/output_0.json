    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   Chef has two houses, each with N rooms. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i. Chef also has N boxes of tiles, where the i-th box contains i tiles. Chef wants to use the tiles to completely tile rooms in both houses such that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The task is to determine how many rooms in total can be completely tiled across both houses.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To tile a room completely, the number of tiles in a box must be exactly twice the area of the room (since each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house). Therefore, for a room with area i*i, we need 2 * (i*i) tiles. We need to find all i such that i (the number of tiles in the i-th box) is equal to 2 * (i*i). This simplifies to finding i such that i = 2 * i^2, which is not possible for any positive integer i. However, if we consider the problem as finding i such that i = 2 * j^2 for some integer j, we can find the number of such j values.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n       for each N in test_cases:\n           count = 0\n           for i from 1 to N:\n               if i is a perfect square:\n                   j = sqrt(i)\n                   if 2 * j^2 <= N:\n                       count += 1\n           print count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for N in test_cases:\n        count = 0\n        # Iterate over possible room sizes\n        i = 1\n        while i * i <= N:\n            # Check if the number of tiles in the box can tile two rooms of size i*i\n            if 2 * i * i <= N:\n                count += 1\n            i += 1\n        results.append(count)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n    count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each test case, checking for each possible room size if it can be tiled using the tiles from the corresponding box. The count of such rooms is then printed for each test case.",
