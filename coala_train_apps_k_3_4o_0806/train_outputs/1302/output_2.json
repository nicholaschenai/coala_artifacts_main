    "raw_msg": "Let's correct the solution based on the insights from the problem analysis. The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N`. This is because the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is `k * (k + 1) / 2`, and we need to find the largest `k` such that this sum is less than or equal to `N`. This `k` will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for N in test_cases:\n        count = 0\n        # Find the largest k such that k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N\n        k = 1\n        while k * (k + 1) // 2 <= N:\n            count += 1\n            k += 1\n        results.append(count)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n    count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.\n- **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This is done using a simple loop.\n- **Output Results**: For each test case, we print the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\nThis solution correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.",
