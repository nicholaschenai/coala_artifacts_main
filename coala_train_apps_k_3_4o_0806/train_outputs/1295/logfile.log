INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a number of queries, Q. Each query consists of two integers, N and K. For each query, we need to calculate the sum S(N, K) which is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers modulo K. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2) for i >= 2

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so calculating it directly for large N is inefficient. However, we only need the sum modulo K, which can be simplified using properties of modular arithmetic.

2. **Use Pisano Period**: The Fibonacci sequence modulo any number K is periodic, known as the Pisano period. This means that after a certain number of terms, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo K repeats. We can use this property to reduce the computation for large N.

3. **Calculate Pisano Period**: For each query, calculate the Pisano period for the given K. This will help us determine how the Fibonacci sequence behaves under modulo K.

4. **Sum within Pisano Period**: Once the Pisano period is known, calculate the sum of Fibonacci numbers within one full period. Use this to compute the sum for N terms by considering how many full periods fit into N and the remainder.

5. **Compute Result for Each Query**: For each query, use the Pisano period and the precomputed sums to quickly calculate the result S(N, K).

## Pseudocode

```
function pisano_period(k):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i from 0 to k*k:
        a, b = b, (a + b) % k
        if a == 0 and b == 1:
            return i + 1

function fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):
    period = pisano_period(k)
    full_periods = n // period
    remainder = n % period
    
    fib_mod = [0, 1]
    for i from 2 to period:
        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)
    
    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k
    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k
    
    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k

function main():
    read Q
    for each query:
        read N, K
        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def pisano_period(k):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(k * k):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % k
        if a == 0 and b == 1:
            return i + 1

def fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):
    period = pisano_period(k)
    full_periods = n // period
    remainder = n % period
    
    fib_mod = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, period):
        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)
    
    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k
    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k
    
    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution efficiently calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers modulo K for each query by leveraging the periodic nature of the Fibonacci sequence under modulo operations.

    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        ### Step-by-Step Analysis

        1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.

        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.

        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.

        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.

        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.

        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.

        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.

        ### Potential Issues

        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.

        ### Correction

        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.

        ### Corrected Code

        ```python
        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)

            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod

                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)
                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)

        This code should now correctly read input, process each test case, and output the results as expected. The main issue was that the function `solve_queries()` was not being called, which has now been fixed.

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(I-1, K-1)\).

        3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \(2^{N-I}\) possible combinations.

        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            for i from 2 to max_n:
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod-2, mod)
            for i from max_n-1 down to 1:
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod
            return factorials, inverses

        function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod

        function solve_queries(T, queries, mod):
            max_n = 4000
            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod)
            results = []
            for each test case:
                read N and Q
                for each query:
                    read I and K
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverses, mod)
                        count_greater = pow(2, N-I, mod)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % mod
                        results.append(result)
            return results
        ```

                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD

            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")
        ```

        This code efficiently handles the problem by precomputing factorials and their inverses, allowing for quick computation of binomial coefficients and powers of 2, which are essential for solving each query.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts on the Fibonacci Last Digit Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around the Fibonacci sequence and its properties, specifically focusing on the last digit of Fibonacci numbers. A key insight is that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This periodicity allows us to reduce the problem's complexity significantly, especially given the constraints where \( N \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \).

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the approach was to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, which was incorrect. The mistake was in misunderstanding how the sequence reduction should be simulated. The correct approach involves using the periodic sequence of last digits and simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

    #### Correct Approach
    1. **Precompute the Periodic Sequence**: Calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
    2. **Simulate Sequence Reduction**: Use the precomputed sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

    #### Code Snippet
    ```python
    def generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
        last_digits = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, 60):
            last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
        return last_digits

    def find_last_remaining_number(N):
        last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()
        position = (N - 1) % 60
        while position > 0:
            position = position // 2
        return last_digits[position]

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    #### Lessons Learned
    The key takeaway is the importance of understanding the periodic nature of sequences and how it can be leveraged to simplify complex problems. Additionally, correctly simulating processes that involve iterative reductions is crucial for solving such problems accurately.

   We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two numbers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Given the constraints where \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), directly computing the Fibonacci numbers and their powers is not feasible.

The key idea is to use the Pisano period, which is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo some number repeats. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.

   For each query:
   - Compute the Pisano period for a suitable modulus.
   - Use the Pisano period to find the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo the period.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two numbers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Given the constraints where \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), directly computing the Fibonacci numbers and their powers is not feasible. Instead, we can use properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. The key idea is to use the Pisano period, which is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo some number repeats. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.

   For each query:
   - Compute the Pisano period for a suitable modulus.
   - Use the Pisano period to find the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo the period.
   - Raise each Fibonacci number in this reduced sequence to the power of \( K \) and sum them up.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function pisano_period(modulus):
       a, b = 0, 1
       for i from 0 to modulus * modulus:
           a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus

           fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
           sum = (sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus
       return sum

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \), for multiple queries.
   - The constraints are very large, so we need to use properties like the Pisano period to handle large numbers efficiently.

2. **Potential Issues in the Code:**
   - **Pisano Period Calculation:** The Pisano period is calculated for a modulus, but the modulus used in the code is not specified correctly. We need to ensure that the modulus is appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - **Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci calculation should be efficient and handle large numbers. The current implementation might not be optimal for very large \( N \).
   - **Handling Large Numbers:** The code should handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic, but the current approach might not be correctly applying the modulus in all necessary places.
   - **Looping Over Pisano Period:** The loop should correctly handle the Pisano period and ensure that the sum is computed correctly for large \( N \).

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**
   - **Modulus Usage:** The modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) is used, but the Pisano period calculation might not be correctly applied with this modulus.
   - **Loop Logic:** The loop logic for summing the Fibonacci powers might not be correctly handling the case when \( N \) is larger than the Pisano period.
   - **Output Handling:** The code might not be correctly outputting the results due to incorrect handling of input or output.

4. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure the Pisano period is calculated correctly for the modulus.
   - Optimize the Fibonacci calculation to handle large \( N \) efficiently.
   - Correctly apply the modulus in all necessary calculations.
   - Ensure the loop logic correctly handles the Pisano period and large \( N \).

Let's revise the code with these considerations in mind:

```python
def pisano_period(modulus):
    # Calculate the Pisano period for a given modulus
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(modulus * modulus):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
        if a == 0 and b == 1:
            return i + 1

def fibonacci_mod(n, modulus):
    # Calculate the nth Fibonacci number modulo a given modulus
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
    return b

def sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, modulus):
    # Calculate the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers each raised to the power of K, modulo a given modulus
    period = pisano_period(modulus)
    sum = 0
    # We only need to consider the first `period` Fibonacci numbers due to periodicity
    for i in range(period):
        fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
        sum = (sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus
    # Calculate how many full periods fit into N
    full_periods = N // period
    # Calculate the remainder part
    remainder = N % period
    # Sum for full periods
    sum = (sum * full_periods) % modulus
    # Add the remainder part
    for i in range(remainder):
        fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
        sum = (sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        result = sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, 10**9 + 7)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \), for multiple queries.
   - The constraints are very large, so we need to use properties like the Pisano period to handle large numbers efficiently.

2. **Potential Issues in the Code:**
   - **Pisano Period Calculation:** The Pisano period is calculated for a modulus, but the modulus used in the code is not specified correctly. We need to ensure that the modulus is appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - **Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci calculation should be efficient and handle large numbers. The current implementation might not be optimal for very large \( N \).
   - **Handling Large Numbers:** The code should handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic, but the current approach might not be correctly applying the modulus in all necessary places.
   - **Looping Over Pisano Period:** The loop should correctly handle the Pisano period and ensure that the sum is computed correctly for large \( N \).

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**
   - **Modulus Usage:** The modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) is used, but the Pisano period calculation might not be correctly applied with this modulus.
   - **Loop Logic:** The loop logic for summing the Fibonacci powers might not be correctly handling the case when \( N \) is larger than the Pisano period.
   - **Output Handling:** The code might not be correctly outputting the results due to incorrect handling of input or output.

4. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure the Pisano period is calculated correctly for the modulus.
   - Optimize the Fibonacci calculation to handle large \( N \) efficiently.
   - Correctly apply the modulus in all necessary calculations.
   - Ensure the loop logic correctly handles the Pisano period and large \( N \).

Let's revise the code with these considerations in mind:

```python
def pisano_period(modulus):
    # Calculate the Pisano period for a given modulus
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(modulus * modulus):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
        if a == 0 and b == 1:
            return i + 1

def fibonacci_mod(n, modulus):
    # Calculate the nth Fibonacci number modulo a given modulus
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
    return b

def sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, modulus):
    # Calculate the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers each raised to the power of K, modulo a given modulus
    period = pisano_period(modulus)
    sum = 0
    # We only need to consider the first `period` Fibonacci numbers due to periodicity
    for i in range(period):
        fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
        sum = (sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus
    # Calculate how many full periods fit into N
    full_periods = N // period
    # Calculate the remainder part
    remainder = N % period
    # Sum for full periods
    sum = (sum * full_periods) % modulus
    # Add the remainder part
    for i in range(remainder):
        fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
        sum = (sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus
    return sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        result = sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, 10**9 + 7)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000

        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        ### Step-by-Step Analysis

        1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.

        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.

        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.

        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.

        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.

        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.

        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.

        ### Potential Issues

        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.

        ### Correction

        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.

        ### Corrected Code

        ```python
        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)

            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod
            return factorials, inverses

                    index += 2
            
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)
                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(I-1, K-1)\).

        3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \(2^{N-I}\) possible combinations.

        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts on the Fibonacci Last Digit Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around the Fibonacci sequence and its properties, specifically focusing on the last digit of Fibonacci numbers. A key insight is that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This periodicity allows us to reduce the problem's complexity significantly, especially given the constraints where \( N \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \).

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the approach was to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, which was incorrect. The mistake was in misunderstanding how the sequence reduction should be simulated. The correct approach involves using the periodic sequence of last digits and simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

    #### Correct Approach
    1. **Precompute the Periodic Sequence**: Calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
    2. **Simulate Sequence Reduction**: Use the precomputed sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

    #### Code Snippet
    ```python
    def generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
        last_digits = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, 60):
            last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
        return last_digits

    def find_last_remaining_number(N):
        last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()
        position = (N - 1) % 60
        while position > 0:
            position = position // 2
        return last_digits[position]

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    #### Lessons Learned
    The key takeaway is the importance of understanding the periodic nature of sequences and how it can be leveraged to simplify complex problems. Additionally, correctly simulating processes that involve iterative reductions is crucial for solving such problems accurately.

### Explanation:
- **Pisano Period**: The Pisano period is used to determine the repeating cycle of Fibonacci numbers modulo a number. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.
- **Fibonacci Calculation**: We calculate Fibonacci numbers modulo a given modulus to prevent overflow and handle large numbers efficiently.
- **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to the power of \( K \) for one full Pisano period and then multiply by the number of full periods in \( N \). We also add the sum for the remaining part of \( N \) that doesn't complete a full period.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits and meet problem constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

-----Output-----

Output Q lines with one integer each. The ith line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Q <= 5*104
- 1 <= N <= 1018
- 1 <= K <= 1018

-----Example-----
Input:
1
1 1
Output:

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two numbers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Given the constraints where \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), directly computing the Fibonacci numbers and their powers is not feasible. Instead, we can use properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. The key idea is to use the Pisano period, which is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo some number repeats. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.

   For each query:
   - Compute the Pisano period for a suitable modulus.
   - Use the Pisano period to find the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo the period.
   - Raise each Fibonacci number in this reduced sequence to the power of \( K \) and sum them up.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function pisano_period(modulus):
       a, b = 0, 1
       for i from 0 to modulus * modulus:
           a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
           if a == 0 and b == 1:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \), for multiple queries.
   - The constraints are very large, so we need to use properties like the Pisano period to handle large numbers efficiently.

2. **Potential Issues in the Code:**
   - **Pisano Period Calculation:** The Pisano period is calculated for a modulus, but the modulus used in the code is not specified correctly. We need to ensure that the modulus is appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - **Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci calculation should be efficient and handle large numbers. The current implementation might not be optimal for very large \( N \).
   - **Handling Large Numbers:** The code should handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic, but the current approach might not be correctly applying the modulus in all necessary places.
   - **Looping Over Pisano Period:** The loop should correctly handle the Pisano period and ensure that the sum is computed correctly for large \( N \).

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**
   - **Modulus Usage:** The modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) is used, but the Pisano period calculation might not be correctly applied with this modulus.
   - **Loop Logic:** The loop logic for summing the Fibonacci powers might not be correctly handling the case when \( N \) is larger than the Pisano period.
   - **Output Handling:** The code might not be correctly outputting the results due to incorrect handling of input or output.

4. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure the Pisano period is calculated correctly for the modulus.
   - Optimize the Fibonacci calculation to handle large \( N \) efficiently.
   - Correctly apply the modulus in all necessary calculations.
   - Ensure the loop logic correctly handles the Pisano period and large \( N \).

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's address the problem with a revised solution. The main issue with the previous solution was the incorrect handling of large Fibonacci numbers and their powers due to the constraints.

### Explanation:
- **Pisano Period**: The Pisano period is used to determine the repeating cycle of Fibonacci numbers modulo a number. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.
- **Fibonacci Calculation**: We calculate Fibonacci numbers modulo a given modulus to prevent overflow and handle large numbers efficiently.
- **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to the power of \( K \) for one full Pisano period and then multiply by the number of full periods in \( N \). We also add the sum for the remaining part of \( N \) that doesn't complete a full period.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits and meet problem constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

-----Output-----

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two numbers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Given the constraints where \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), directly computing the Fibonacci numbers and their powers is not feasible. Instead, we can use properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. The key idea is to use the Pisano period, which is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo some number repeats. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.

   For each query:
   - Compute the Pisano period for a suitable modulus.
   - Use the Pisano period to find the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo the period.
   - Raise each Fibonacci number in this reduced sequence to the power of \( K \) and sum them up.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function pisano_period(modulus):
       a, b = 0, 1
       for i from 0 to modulus * modulus:
           a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus

       for i from 2 to n:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \), for multiple queries.
   - The constraints are very large, so we need to use properties like the Pisano period to handle large numbers efficiently.

2. **Potential Issues in the Code:**
   - **Pisano Period Calculation:** The Pisano period is calculated for a modulus, but the modulus used in the code is not specified correctly. We need to ensure that the modulus is appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - **Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci calculation should be efficient and handle large numbers. The current implementation might not be optimal for very large \( N \).
   - **Handling Large Numbers:** The code should handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic, but the current approach might not be correctly applying the modulus in all necessary places.
   - **Looping Over Pisano Period:** The loop should correctly handle the Pisano period and ensure that the sum is computed correctly for large \( N \).

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**
   - **Modulus Usage:** The modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) is used, but the Pisano period calculation might not be correctly applied with this modulus.
   - **Loop Logic:** The loop logic for summing the Fibonacci powers might not be correctly handling the case when \( N \) is larger than the Pisano period.
   - **Output Handling:** The code might not be correctly outputting the results due to incorrect handling of input or output.

4. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure the Pisano period is calculated correctly for the modulus.
   - Optimize the Fibonacci calculation to handle large \( N \) efficiently.
   - Correctly apply the modulus in all necessary calculations.
   - Ensure the loop logic correctly handles the Pisano period and large \( N \).

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's address the problem with a revised solution. The main issue with the previous solution was the incorrect handling of large Fibonacci numbers and their powers due to the constraints.

### Explanation:
- **Pisano Period**: The Pisano period is used to determine the repeating cycle of Fibonacci numbers modulo a number. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.
- **Fibonacci Calculation**: We calculate Fibonacci numbers modulo a given modulus to prevent overflow and handle large numbers efficiently.
- **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to the power of \( K \) for one full Pisano period and then multiply by the number of full periods in \( N \). We also add the sum for the remaining part of \( N \) that doesn't complete a full period.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits and meet problem constraints.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        ### Step-by-Step Analysis

        1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.

        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.

        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.

        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.

        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.

        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.

        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.

        ### Potential Issues

        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.

        ### Correction

        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.

        ### Corrected Code

        ```python
        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):

                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD

    ### Summary of Attempts on the Fibonacci Last Digit Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around the Fibonacci sequence and its properties, specifically focusing on the last digit of Fibonacci numbers. A key insight is that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This periodicity allows us to reduce the problem's complexity significantly, especially given the constraints where \( N \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \).

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the approach was to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, which was incorrect. The mistake was in misunderstanding how the sequence reduction should be simulated. The correct approach involves using the periodic sequence of last digits and simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

    #### Correct Approach
    1. **Precompute the Periodic Sequence**: Calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
    2. **Simulate Sequence Reduction**: Use the precomputed sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

    #### Code Snippet
    ```python
    def generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
        last_digits = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, 60):
            last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
        return last_digits

    def find_last_remaining_number(N):
        last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()
        position = (N - 1) % 60
        while position > 0:
            position = position // 2
        return last_digits[position]

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    #### Lessons Learned
    The key takeaway is the importance of understanding the periodic nature of sequences and how it can be leveraged to simplify complex problems. Additionally, correctly simulating processes that involve iterative reductions is crucial for solving such problems accurately.

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(I-1, K-1)\).

        3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \(2^{N-I}\) possible combinations.

        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            for i from 2 to max_n:
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod-2, mod)
            for i from max_n-1 down to 1:
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod
            return factorials, inverses

        function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod

        function solve_queries(T, queries, mod):
            max_n = 4000
            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod)
            results = []
            for each test case:
                read N and Q
                for each query:
                    read I and K
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverses, mod)
                        count_greater = pow(2, N-I, mod)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % mod
                        results.append(result)
            return results

                        results.append(0)

                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)
                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)

            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")
        ```

        This code efficiently handles the problem by precomputing factorials and their inverses, allowing for quick computation of binomial coefficients and powers of 2, which are essential for solving each query.

- **Pisano Period**: The Pisano period is used to determine the repeating cycle of Fibonacci numbers modulo a number. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.
- **Fibonacci Calculation**: We calculate Fibonacci numbers modulo a given modulus to prevent overflow and handle large numbers efficiently.
- **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to the power of \( K \) for one full Pisano period and then multiply by the number of full periods in \( N \). We also add the sum for the remaining part of \( N \) that doesn't complete a full period.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits and meet problem constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

-----Output-----

Output Q lines with one integer each. The ith line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Q <= 5*104
- 1 <= N <= 1018
- 1 <= K <= 1018

-----Example-----
Input:
1
1 1
Output:
1

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two numbers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Given the constraints where \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), directly computing the Fibonacci numbers and their powers is not feasible. Instead, we can use properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. The key idea is to use the Pisano period, which is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo some number repeats. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.

   For each query:
   - Compute the Pisano period for a suitable modulus.
   - Use the Pisano period to find the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo the period.
   - Raise each Fibonacci number in this reduced sequence to the power of \( K \) and sum them up.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function pisano_period(modulus):
       a, b = 0, 1
       for i from 0 to modulus * modulus:
           a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
           if a == 0 and b == 1:
               return i + 1

           return 1
       a, b = 0, 1
       for i from 2 to n:
           a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
       return b

   function sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, modulus):
       period = pisano_period(modulus)
       sum = 0
       for i from 0 to min(N, period):
           fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
           sum = (sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus
       return sum

   function main():
       read Q
       for each query:
           read N, K
           result = sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, 10**9 + 7)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \), for multiple queries.
   - The constraints are very large, so we need to use properties like the Pisano period to handle large numbers efficiently.

2. **Potential Issues in the Code:**
   - **Pisano Period Calculation:** The Pisano period is calculated for a modulus, but the modulus used in the code is not specified correctly. We need to ensure that the modulus is appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - **Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci calculation should be efficient and handle large numbers. The current implementation might not be optimal for very large \( N \).
   - **Handling Large Numbers:** The code should handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic, but the current approach might not be correctly applying the modulus in all necessary places.
   - **Looping Over Pisano Period:** The loop should correctly handle the Pisano period and ensure that the sum is computed correctly for large \( N \).

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**
   - **Modulus Usage:** The modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) is used, but the Pisano period calculation might not be correctly applied with this modulus.
   - **Loop Logic:** The loop logic for summing the Fibonacci powers might not be correctly handling the case when \( N \) is larger than the Pisano period.
   - **Output Handling:** The code might not be correctly outputting the results due to incorrect handling of input or output.

4. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure the Pisano period is calculated correctly for the modulus.
   - Optimize the Fibonacci calculation to handle large \( N \) efficiently.
   - Correctly apply the modulus in all necessary calculations.
   - Ensure the loop logic correctly handles the Pisano period and large \( N \).

### Explanation:
- **Pisano Period**: The Pisano period is used to determine the repeating cycle of Fibonacci numbers modulo a number. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.
- **Fibonacci Calculation**: We calculate Fibonacci numbers modulo a given modulus to prevent overflow and handle large numbers efficiently.
- **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to the power of \( K \) for one full Pisano period and then multiply by the number of full periods in \( N \). We also add the sum for the remaining part of \( N \) that doesn't complete a full period.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits and meet problem constraints.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \), for multiple queries.
   - The constraints are very large, so we need to use properties like the Pisano period to handle large numbers efficiently.

2. **Potential Issues in the Code:**
   - **Pisano Period Calculation:** The Pisano period is calculated for a modulus, but the modulus used in the code is not specified correctly. We need to ensure that the modulus is appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - **Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci calculation should be efficient and handle large numbers. The current implementation might not be optimal for very large \( N \).
   - **Handling Large Numbers:** The code should handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic, but the current approach might not be correctly applying the modulus in all necessary places.
   - **Looping Over Pisano Period:** The loop should correctly handle the Pisano period and ensure that the sum is computed correctly for large \( N \).

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**
   - **Modulus Usage:** The modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) is used, but the Pisano period calculation might not be correctly applied with this modulus.
   - **Loop Logic:** The loop logic for summing the Fibonacci powers might not be correctly handling the case when \( N \) is larger than the Pisano period.
   - **Output Handling:** The code might not be correctly outputting the results due to incorrect handling of input or output.

4. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure the Pisano period is calculated correctly for the modulus.
   - Optimize the Fibonacci calculation to handle large \( N \) efficiently.
   - Correctly apply the modulus in all necessary calculations.
   - Ensure the loop logic correctly handles the Pisano period and large \( N \).

Let's revise the code with these considerations in mind:

```python
def pisano_period(modulus):
    # Calculate the Pisano period for a given modulus
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(modulus * modulus):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
        if a == 0 and b == 1:
            return i + 1

def fibonacci_mod(n, modulus):
    # Calculate the nth Fibonacci number modulo a given modulus
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
    return b

def sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, modulus):
    # Calculate the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers each raised to the power of K, modulo a given modulus
    period = pisano_period(modulus)
    sum_period = 0
    # Calculate the sum of powers for one full period
    for i in range(period):
        fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
        sum_period = (sum_period + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus
    # Calculate how many full periods fit into N
    full_periods = N // period
    # Calculate the remainder part
    remainder = N % period
    # Sum for full periods
    total_sum = (sum_period * full_periods) % modulus
    # Add the remainder part
    for i in range(remainder):
        fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
        total_sum = (total_sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus
    return total_sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    Q = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        result = sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, 10**9 + 7)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":

```

This revised code should handle the large constraints more efficiently by leveraging the Pisano period and modular arithmetic correctly.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two numbers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Given the constraints where \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), directly computing the Fibonacci numbers and their powers is not feasible. Instead, we can use properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. The key idea is to use the Pisano period, which is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo some number repeats. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.

   For each query:
   - Compute the Pisano period for a suitable modulus.
   - Use the Pisano period to find the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo the period.
   - Raise each Fibonacci number in this reduced sequence to the power of \( K \) and sum them up.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function pisano_period(modulus):
       a, b = 0, 1
       for i from 0 to modulus * modulus:
           a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus

       for i from 2 to n:
           a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
       return b

   function sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, modulus):
       period = pisano_period(modulus)
       sum = 0
       for i from 0 to min(N, period):
           fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
           sum = (sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus

           result = sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, 10**9 + 7)

### Explanation:
- **Pisano Period**: The Pisano period is used to determine the repeating cycle of Fibonacci numbers modulo a number. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.
- **Fibonacci Calculation**: We calculate Fibonacci numbers modulo a given modulus to prevent overflow and handle large numbers efficiently.
- **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to the power of \( K \) for one full Pisano period and then multiply by the number of full periods in \( N \). We also add the sum for the remaining part of \( N \) that doesn't complete a full period.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits and meet problem constraints.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \), for multiple queries.
   - The constraints are very large, so we need to use properties like the Pisano period to handle large numbers efficiently.

2. **Potential Issues in the Code:**
   - **Pisano Period Calculation:** The Pisano period is calculated for a modulus, but the modulus used in the code is not specified correctly. We need to ensure that the modulus is appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - **Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci calculation should be efficient and handle large numbers. The current implementation might not be optimal for very large \( N \).
   - **Handling Large Numbers:** The code should handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic, but the current approach might not be correctly applying the modulus in all necessary places.
   - **Looping Over Pisano Period:** The loop should correctly handle the Pisano period and ensure that the sum is computed correctly for large \( N \).

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**
   - **Modulus Usage:** The modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) is used, but the Pisano period calculation might not be correctly applied with this modulus.
   - **Loop Logic:** The loop logic for summing the Fibonacci powers might not be correctly handling the case when \( N \) is larger than the Pisano period.
   - **Output Handling:** The code might not be correctly outputting the results due to incorrect handling of input or output.

4. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure the Pisano period is calculated correctly for the modulus.
   - Optimize the Fibonacci calculation to handle large \( N \) efficiently.
   - Correctly apply the modulus in all necessary calculations.
   - Ensure the loop logic correctly handles the Pisano period and large \( N \).

    # Calculate the remainder part
    remainder = N % period
    # Sum for full periods
    total_sum = (sum_period * full_periods) % modulus
    # Add the remainder part
    for i in range(remainder):
        fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
        total_sum = (total_sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus
    return total_sum

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        ### Step-by-Step Analysis

        1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.

        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.

        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.

        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.

        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.

        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.

        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.

        ### Potential Issues

        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.

        ### Correction

        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.

        ### Corrected Code

        ```python
        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):

                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD
                        results.append(result)

        This code should now correctly read input, process each test case, and output the results as expected. The main issue was that the function `solve_queries()` was not being called, which has now been fixed.

    ### Summary of Attempts on the Fibonacci Last Digit Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around the Fibonacci sequence and its properties, specifically focusing on the last digit of Fibonacci numbers. A key insight is that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This periodicity allows us to reduce the problem's complexity significantly, especially given the constraints where \( N \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \).

    #### Strategies and Errors
    Initially, the approach was to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, which was incorrect. The mistake was in misunderstanding how the sequence reduction should be simulated. The correct approach involves using the periodic sequence of last digits and simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.

    #### Correct Approach
    1. **Precompute the Periodic Sequence**: Calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
    2. **Simulate Sequence Reduction**: Use the precomputed sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.

    #### Code Snippet
    ```python
    def generate_fibonacci_last_digits():
        last_digits = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, 60):
            last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
        return last_digits

    def find_last_remaining_number(N):
        last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()
        position = (N - 1) % 60
        while position > 0:
            position = position // 2
        return last_digits[position]

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    #### Lessons Learned
    The key takeaway is the importance of understanding the periodic nature of sequences and how it can be leveraged to simplify complex problems. Additionally, correctly simulating processes that involve iterative reductions is crucial for solving such problems accurately.

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(I-1, K-1)\).

        3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \(2^{N-I}\) possible combinations.

        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            for i from 2 to max_n:
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod-2, mod)
            for i from max_n-1 down to 1:
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod
            return factorials, inverses

        function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod

        function solve_queries(T, queries, mod):
            max_n = 4000
            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod)
            results = []
            for each test case:
                read N and Q
                for each query:
                    read I and K
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverses, mod)
                        count_greater = pow(2, N-I, mod)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % mod
                        results.append(result)

                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)
                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)

            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")
        ```

        This code efficiently handles the problem by precomputing factorials and their inverses, allowing for quick computation of binomial coefficients and powers of 2, which are essential for solving each query.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two numbers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Given the constraints where \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), directly computing the Fibonacci numbers and their powers is not feasible. Instead, we can use properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. The key idea is to use the Pisano period, which is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo some number repeats. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.

   For each query:
   - Compute the Pisano period for a suitable modulus.
   - Use the Pisano period to find the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo the period.
   - Raise each Fibonacci number in this reduced sequence to the power of \( K \) and sum them up.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function pisano_period(modulus):
       a, b = 0, 1
       for i from 0 to modulus * modulus:
           a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
           if a == 0 and b == 1:
               return i + 1

       if n == 0:
           return 0
       elif n == 1:
           return 1
       a, b = 0, 1
       for i from 2 to n:
           a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus
       return b

   function sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, modulus):
       period = pisano_period(modulus)
       sum = 0
       for i from 0 to min(N, period):
           fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
           sum = (sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus
       return sum

   function main():
       read Q
       for each query:
           read N, K
           result = sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, 10**9 + 7)
           print result
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \), for multiple queries.
   - The constraints are very large, so we need to use properties like the Pisano period to handle large numbers efficiently.

2. **Potential Issues in the Code:**
   - **Pisano Period Calculation:** The Pisano period is calculated for a modulus, but the modulus used in the code is not specified correctly. We need to ensure that the modulus is appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - **Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci calculation should be efficient and handle large numbers. The current implementation might not be optimal for very large \( N \).
   - **Handling Large Numbers:** The code should handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic, but the current approach might not be correctly applying the modulus in all necessary places.
   - **Looping Over Pisano Period:** The loop should correctly handle the Pisano period and ensure that the sum is computed correctly for large \( N \).

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**
   - **Modulus Usage:** The modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) is used, but the Pisano period calculation might not be correctly applied with this modulus.
   - **Loop Logic:** The loop logic for summing the Fibonacci powers might not be correctly handling the case when \( N \) is larger than the Pisano period.
   - **Output Handling:** The code might not be correctly outputting the results due to incorrect handling of input or output.

4. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure the Pisano period is calculated correctly for the modulus.
   - Optimize the Fibonacci calculation to handle large \( N \) efficiently.
   - Correctly apply the modulus in all necessary calculations.
   - Ensure the loop logic correctly handles the Pisano period and large \( N \).

### Explanation:
- **Pisano Period**: The Pisano period is used to determine the repeating cycle of Fibonacci numbers modulo a number. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.
- **Fibonacci Calculation**: We calculate Fibonacci numbers modulo a given modulus to prevent overflow and handle large numbers efficiently.
- **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to the power of \( K \) for one full Pisano period and then multiply by the number of full periods in \( N \). We also add the sum for the remaining part of \( N \) that doesn't complete a full period.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits and meet problem constraints.

### Explanation:
- **Pisano Period**: The Pisano period is used to determine the repeating cycle of Fibonacci numbers modulo a number. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.
- **Fibonacci Calculation**: We calculate Fibonacci numbers modulo a given modulus to prevent overflow and handle large numbers efficiently.
- **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to the power of \( K \) for one full Pisano period and then multiply by the number of full periods in \( N \). We also add the sum for the remaining part of \( N \) that doesn't complete a full period.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits and meet problem constraints.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \), for multiple queries.
   - The constraints are very large, so we need to use properties like the Pisano period to handle large numbers efficiently.

2. **Potential Issues in the Code:**
   - **Pisano Period Calculation:** The Pisano period is calculated for a modulus, but the modulus used in the code is not specified correctly. We need to ensure that the modulus is appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - **Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci calculation should be efficient and handle large numbers. The current implementation might not be optimal for very large \( N \).
   - **Handling Large Numbers:** The code should handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic, but the current approach might not be correctly applying the modulus in all necessary places.
   - **Looping Over Pisano Period:** The loop should correctly handle the Pisano period and ensure that the sum is computed correctly for large \( N \).

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**
   - **Modulus Usage:** The modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) is used, but the Pisano period calculation might not be correctly applied with this modulus.
   - **Loop Logic:** The loop logic for summing the Fibonacci powers might not be correctly handling the case when \( N \) is larger than the Pisano period.
   - **Output Handling:** The code might not be correctly outputting the results due to incorrect handling of input or output.

4. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure the Pisano period is calculated correctly for the modulus.
   - Optimize the Fibonacci calculation to handle large \( N \) efficiently.
   - Correctly apply the modulus in all necessary calculations.
   - Ensure the loop logic correctly handles the Pisano period and large \( N \).

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Fibonacci Power Sum Problem

**Core Concepts:**
- The problem involves calculating the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \), for multiple queries.
- Given the constraints where \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), direct computation is infeasible.
- The key concept is leveraging the Pisano period, which is the cycle length of Fibonacci numbers modulo a number, to reduce computational complexity.

**Strategies and Challenges:**
- **Pisano Period:** Initially, the Pisano period was calculated correctly, but its application in reducing the problem size was not fully optimized.
- **Modular Arithmetic:** The use of modular arithmetic was crucial to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. However, ensuring that all operations correctly applied the modulus was a challenge.
- **Loop Logic:** The logic to handle full periods and the remainder of \( N \) was initially flawed, leading to incorrect results.

**Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
- **Runtime Errors:** The code faced runtime errors due to inefficient handling of large numbers and incorrect loop logic.
- **Fixes:** The solution required careful handling of the Pisano period to ensure that only necessary Fibonacci numbers were computed. Additionally, ensuring that all arithmetic operations were performed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) was essential to prevent overflow and meet problem constraints.

**Conclusion:**
- The problem highlighted the importance of understanding mathematical properties (like the Pisano period) to optimize algorithms for large inputs.
- Future attempts should focus on ensuring that all parts of the solution correctly apply these properties and handle edge cases effectively.

1. Restate the problem in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where each query provides two numbers \( N \) and \( K \). The sum \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Given the constraints where \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), directly computing the Fibonacci numbers and their powers is not feasible. Instead, we can use properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. The key idea is to use the Pisano period, which is the period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo some number repeats. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.

   For each query:
   - Compute the Pisano period for a suitable modulus.
   - Use the Pisano period to find the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers modulo the period.
   - Raise each Fibonacci number in this reduced sequence to the power of \( K \) and sum them up.

### Explanation:
- **Pisano Period**: The Pisano period is used to determine the repeating cycle of Fibonacci numbers modulo a number. This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.
- **Fibonacci Calculation**: We calculate Fibonacci numbers modulo a given modulus to prevent overflow and handle large numbers efficiently.
- **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to the power of \( K \) for one full Pisano period and then multiply by the number of full periods in \( N \). We also add the sum for the remaining part of \( N \) that doesn't complete a full period.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits and meet problem constraints.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \( K \), for multiple queries.
   - The constraints are very large, so we need to use properties like the Pisano period to handle large numbers efficiently.

2. **Potential Issues in the Code:**
   - **Pisano Period Calculation:** The Pisano period is calculated for a modulus, but the modulus used in the code is not specified correctly. We need to ensure that the modulus is appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - **Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci calculation should be efficient and handle large numbers. The current implementation might not be optimal for very large \( N \).
   - **Handling Large Numbers:** The code should handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic, but the current approach might not be correctly applying the modulus in all necessary places.
   - **Looping Over Pisano Period:** The loop should correctly handle the Pisano period and ensure that the sum is computed correctly for large \( N \).

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**
   - **Modulus Usage:** The modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) is used, but the Pisano period calculation might not be correctly applied with this modulus.
   - **Loop Logic:** The loop logic for summing the Fibonacci powers might not be correctly handling the case when \( N \) is larger than the Pisano period.
   - **Output Handling:** The code might not be correctly outputting the results due to incorrect handling of input or output.

4. **Steps to Correct the Code:**
   - Ensure the Pisano period is calculated correctly for the modulus.
   - Optimize the Fibonacci calculation to handle large \( N \) efficiently.
   - Correctly apply the modulus in all necessary calculations.
   - Ensure the loop logic correctly handles the Pisano period and large \( N \).

Let's revise the code with these considerations in mind:

    # Calculate the sum of powers for one full period
    for i in range(period):

    # Calculate how many full periods fit into N
    full_periods = N // period
    # Calculate the remainder part
    remainder = N % period
    # Sum for full periods
    total_sum = (sum_period * full_periods) % modulus
    # Add the remainder part
    for i in range(remainder):
        fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)
        total_sum = (total_sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus
    return total_sum

def main():

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:

1. **Efficient Fibonacci Calculation:**
   - The official solution uses a fast doubling method to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. This method is based on matrix exponentiation and allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time, which is crucial given the large constraints of the problem.

2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The solution makes extensive use of modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. This is a common technique in competitive programming to ensure calculations remain within manageable limits.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The official solution leverages mathematical properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic to derive a formula for the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to a power. This involves using the properties of modular inverses and powers, which are not immediately obvious but are powerful tools in reducing computational complexity.

4. **Comparison with My Approach:**
   - My initial approach attempted to use the Pisano period to reduce the problem size, but it was not correctly implemented to handle the large constraints. The official solution, on the other hand, directly computes the required sum using a derived formula, which is more efficient and avoids the pitfalls of handling large sequences directly.

5. **Key Takeaway:**
   - The problem highlights the importance of understanding mathematical properties and efficient algorithms (like fast doubling for Fibonacci) in solving problems with large constraints. It also underscores the need to carefully apply modular arithmetic to ensure correctness and efficiency.

In future problems, considering mathematical derivations and efficient algorithms can significantly improve both the correctness and performance of the solution.
