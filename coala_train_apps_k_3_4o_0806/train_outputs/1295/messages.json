        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a number of queries, Q. Each query consists of two integers, N and K. For each query, we need to calculate the sum S(N, K) which is defined as the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers modulo K. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n- F(0) = 0\n- F(1) = 1\n- F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2) for i >= 2\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so calculating it directly for large N is inefficient. However, we only need the sum modulo K, which can be simplified using properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n2. **Use Pisano Period**: The Fibonacci sequence modulo any number K is periodic, known as the Pisano period. This means that after a certain number of terms, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers modulo K repeats. We can use this property to reduce the computation for large N.\n\n3. **Calculate Pisano Period**: For each query, calculate the Pisano period for the given K. This will help us determine how the Fibonacci sequence behaves under modulo K.\n\n4. **Sum within Pisano Period**: Once the Pisano period is known, calculate the sum of Fibonacci numbers within one full period. Use this to compute the sum for N terms by considering how many full periods fit into N and the remainder.\n\n5. **Compute Result for Each Query**: For each query, use the Pisano period and the precomputed sums to quickly calculate the result S(N, K).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction pisano_period(k):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i from 0 to k*k:\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % k\n        if a == 0 and b == 1:\n            return i + 1\n\nfunction fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):\n    period = pisano_period(k)\n    full_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    fib_mod = [0, 1]\n    for i from 2 to period:\n        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)\n    \n    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k\n    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k\n    \n    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k\n\nfunction main():\n    read Q\n    for each query:\n        read N, K\n        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)\n        print result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef pisano_period(k):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in range(k * k):\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % k\n        if a == 0 and b == 1:\n            return i + 1\n\ndef fibonacci_sum_mod(n, k):\n    period = pisano_period(k)\n    full_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    fib_mod = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, period):\n        fib_mod.append((fib_mod[i-1] + fib_mod[i-2]) % k)\n    \n    sum_period = sum(fib_mod) % k\n    sum_remainder = sum(fib_mod[:remainder+1]) % k\n    \n    return (full_periods * sum_period + sum_remainder) % k\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    Q = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        result = fibonacci_sum_mod(N, K)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers modulo K for each query by leveraging the periodic nature of the Fibonacci sequence under modulo operations."

This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.\n\n        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.\n\n        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.\n\n        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.\n\n        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.\n\n        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.\n\n        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.\n\n        ### Potential Issues\n\n        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.\n\n        ### Correction\n\n        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.\n\n        ### Corrected Code\n\n        ```python\n        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)\n            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod\n\n        def solve_queries():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, MOD)\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                        results.append(result)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)) + \"\\n\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute the solution\n        solve_queries()\n        ```\n\n        This corrected code should now properly execute and produce the expected output for the given test cases.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's correct the solution by ensuring that the `solve_queries()` function is called.

There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \\(2^{N-I}\\) possible combinations.\n\n        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i from 2 to max_n:\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod-2, mod)\n            for i from max_n-1 down to 1:\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod\n\n        function solve_queries(T, queries, mod):\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod)\n            results = []\n            for each test case:\n                read N and Q\n                for each query:\n                    read I and K\n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverses, mod)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N-I, mod)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % mod\n                        results.append(result)\n            return results\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)\n            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod\n\n        def solve_queries():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, MOD)\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                        results.append(result)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)) + \"\\n\")\n        ```\n\n        This code efficiently handles the problem by precomputing factorials and their inverses, allowing for quick computation of binomial coefficients and powers of 2, which are essential for solving each query.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['1', '3 3', '1 2', '2 1', '3 2'] Expected output: [{'0'}, {'2'}, {'2'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.

A key insight is that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This periodicity allows us to reduce the problem's complexity significantly, especially given the constraints where \\( N \\) can be as large as \\( 10^{18} \\).\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n    Initially, the approach was to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, which was incorrect. The mistake was in misunderstanding how the sequence reduction should be simulated. The correct approach involves using the periodic sequence of last digits and simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    1. **Precompute the Periodic Sequence**: Calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.\n    2. **Simulate Sequence Reduction**: Use the precomputed sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.\n\n    #### Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def generate_fibonacci_last_digits():\n        last_digits = [0, 1]\n        for i in range(2, 60):\n            last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)\n        return last_digits\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(N):\n        last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()\n        position = (N - 1) % 60\n        while position > 0:\n            position = position // 2\n        return last_digits[position]\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = find_last_remaining_number(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    #### Lessons Learned\n    The key takeaway is the importance of understanding the periodic nature of sequences and how it can be leveraged to simplify complex problems. Additionally, correctly simulating processes that involve iterative reductions is crucial for solving such problems accurately.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is correct.\n\n        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.\n\n        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.\n\n        ### Potential Issues\n\n        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called.

Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.\n\n        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \\(C(I-1, K-1)\\).\n\n        3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \\(2^{N-I}\\) possible combinations.\n\n        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i from 2 to max_n:\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod-2, mod)\n            for i from max_n-1 down to 1:\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod\n\n        function solve_queries(T, queries, mod):\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod)\n            results = []\n            for each test case:\n                read N and Q\n                for each query:\n                    read I and K\n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverses, mod)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N-I, mod)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % mod\n                        results.append(result)\n            return results\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)\n            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod\n\n        def solve_queries():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, MOD)\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                        results.append(result)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)) + \"\\n\")\n        ```\n\n        This code efficiently handles the problem by precomputing factorials and their inverses, allowing for quick computation of binomial coefficients and powers of 2, which are essential for solving each query.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['1', '3 3', '1 2', '2 1', '3 2'] Expected output: [{'0'}, {'2'}, {'2'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.

A key insight is that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This periodicity allows us to reduce the problem's complexity significantly, especially given the constraints where \\( N \\) can be as large as \\( 10^{18} \\).\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n    Initially, the approach was to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, which was incorrect. The mistake was in misunderstanding how the sequence reduction should be simulated. The correct approach involves using the periodic sequence of last digits and simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    1. **Precompute the Periodic Sequence**: Calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.\n    2. **Simulate Sequence Reduction**: Use the precomputed sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.\n\n    #### Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def generate_fibonacci_last_digits():\n        last_digits = [0, 1]\n        for i in range(2, 60):\n            last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)\n        return last_digits\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(N):\n        last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()\n        position = (N - 1) % 60\n        while position > 0:\n            position = position // 2\n        return last_digits[position]\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = find_last_remaining_number(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    #### Lessons Learned\n    The key takeaway is the importance of understanding the periodic nature of sequences and how it can be leveraged to simplify complex problems. Additionally, correctly simulating processes that involve iterative reductions is crucial for solving such problems accurately.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This allows us to reduce the problem size significantly.\n- **Fibonacci Calculation**: We calculate Fibonacci numbers modulo a given modulus to prevent overflow and handle large numbers efficiently.\n- **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to the power of \\( K \\) for one full Pisano period and then multiply by the number of full periods in \\( N \\). We also add the sum for the remaining part of \\( N \\) that doesn't complete a full period.\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are done modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits and meet problem constraints."

We need to ensure that the modulus is appropriate for the problem constraints.\n   - **Fibonacci Calculation:** The Fibonacci calculation should be efficient and handle large numbers. The current implementation might not be optimal for very large \\( N \\).\n   - **Handling Large Numbers:** The code should handle large numbers efficiently using modular arithmetic, but the current approach might not be correctly applying the modulus in all necessary places.\n   - **Looping Over Pisano Period:** The loop should correctly handle the Pisano period and ensure that the sum is computed correctly for large \\( N \\).\n\n3. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**\n   - **Modulus Usage:** The modulus \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) is used, but the Pisano period calculation might not be correctly applied with this modulus.\n   - **Loop Logic:** The loop logic for summing the Fibonacci powers might not be correctly handling the case when \\( N \\) is larger than the Pisano period.\n   - **Output Handling:** The code might not be correctly outputting the results due to incorrect handling of input or output.\n\n4. **Steps to Correct the Code:**\n   - Ensure the Pisano period is calculated correctly for the modulus.\n   - Optimize the Fibonacci calculation to handle large \\( N \\) efficiently.\n   - Correctly apply the modulus in all necessary calculations.\n   - Ensure the loop logic correctly handles the Pisano period and large \\( N \\).\n\nLet's revise the code with these considerations in mind:\n\n```python\ndef pisano_period(modulus):\n    # Calculate the Pisano period for a given modulus\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in range(modulus * modulus):\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus\n        if a == 0 and b == 1:\n            return i + 1\n\ndef fibonacci_mod(n, modulus):\n    # Calculate the nth Fibonacci number modulo a given modulus\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, (a + b) % modulus\n    return b\n\ndef sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, modulus):\n    # Calculate the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers each raised to the power of K, modulo a given modulus\n    period = pisano_period(modulus)\n    sum_period = 0\n    # Calculate the sum of powers for one full period\n    for i in range(period):\n        fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)\n        sum_period = (sum_period + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus\n    # Calculate how many full periods fit into N\n    full_periods = N // period\n    # Calculate the remainder part\n    remainder = N % period\n    # Sum for full periods\n    total_sum = (sum_period * full_periods) % modulus\n    # Add the remainder part\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        fib = fibonacci_mod(i, modulus)\n        total_sum = (total_sum + pow(fib, K, modulus)) % modulus\n    return total_sum\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    Q = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(Q):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        result = sum_fibonacci_powers(N, K, 10**9 + 7)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis revised code should handle the large constraints more efficiently by leveraging the Pisano period and modular arithmetic correctly."

This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.\n\n        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.\n\n        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.\n\n        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.\n\n        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.\n\n        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.\n\n        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.\n\n        ### Potential Issues\n\n        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.\n\n        ### Correction\n\n        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called.

A key insight is that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This periodicity allows us to reduce the problem's complexity significantly, especially given the constraints where \\( N \\) can be as large as \\( 10^{18} \\).\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n    Initially, the approach was to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, which was incorrect. The mistake was in misunderstanding how the sequence reduction should be simulated. The correct approach involves using the periodic sequence of last digits and simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    1. **Precompute the Periodic Sequence**: Calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.\n    2. **Simulate Sequence Reduction**: Use the precomputed sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.\n\n    #### Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def generate_fibonacci_last_digits():\n        last_digits = [0, 1]\n        for i in range(2, 60):\n            last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)\n        return last_digits\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(N):\n        last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()\n        position = (N - 1) % 60\n        while position > 0:\n            position = position // 2\n        return last_digits[position]\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = find_last_remaining_number(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    #### Lessons Learned\n    The key takeaway is the importance of understanding the periodic nature of sequences and how it can be leveraged to simplify complex problems. Additionally, correctly simulating processes that involve iterative reductions is crucial for solving such problems accurately.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.\n        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.\n        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.\n\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\n        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.\n        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each test case print required answer.\n\n        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=1000000\n        Subtask 3: 5 points\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=16\n        - 1<=Q<=1000\n        Subtask 1: 25 points\n        - T=1\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=100000\n        Subtask 2: 70 points\n        - Original Constraints.\n\n        -----Example:-----\n        Input:\n\n        1\n\n        3 3\n\n        1 2\n\n        2 1\n\n        3 2\n\n        Output:\n\n        0\n\n        2\n\n        2\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        For N=3\n\n        total subsets are:\n\n        {1}\n\n        {2}\n\n        {3}\n\n        {1,2}\n\n        {1,3}\n\n        {2,3}\n\n        {1,2,3}\n\n        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.\n\n        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.\n\n        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ### Problem Restatement\n\n        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.\n\n        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \\(C(I-1, K-1)\\).\n\n        3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \\(2^{N-I}\\) possible combinations.\n\n        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i from 2 to max_n:\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod-2, mod)\n            for i from max_n-1 down to 1:\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod\n\n        function solve_queries(T, queries, mod):\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod)\n            results = []\n            for each test case:\n                read N and Q\n                for each query:\n                    read I and K\n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverses, mod)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N-I, mod)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % mod\n                        results.append(result)\n            return results\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)\n            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod\n\n        def solve_queries():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, MOD)\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                        results.append(result)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)) + \"\\n\")\n        ```\n\n        This code efficiently handles the problem by precomputing factorials and their inverses, allowing for quick computation of binomial coefficients and powers of 2, which are essential for solving each query.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['1', '3 3', '1 2', '2 1', '3 2'] Expected output: [{'0'}, {'2'}, {'2'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.

This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.\n\n        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.\n\n        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.\n\n        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.\n\n        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.\n\n        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.\n\n        ### Potential Issues\n\n        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.\n\n        ### Correction\n\n        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.\n\n        ### Corrected Code\n\n        ```python\n        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)\n            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod\n\n        def solve_queries():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, MOD)\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                        results.append(result)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)) + \"\\n\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute the solution\n        solve_queries()\n        ```\n\n        This corrected code should now properly execute and produce the expected output for the given test cases.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's correct the solution by ensuring that the `solve_queries()` function is called.

A key insight is that the sequence of last digits of Fibonacci numbers is periodic with a period of 60. This periodicity allows us to reduce the problem's complexity significantly, especially given the constraints where \\( N \\) can be as large as \\( 10^{18} \\).\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n    Initially, the approach was to simulate the sequence reduction by halving the position index, which was incorrect. The mistake was in misunderstanding how the sequence reduction should be simulated. The correct approach involves using the periodic sequence of last digits and simulating the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one element remains.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    1. **Precompute the Periodic Sequence**: Calculate the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.\n    2. **Simulate Sequence Reduction**: Use the precomputed sequence to simulate the reduction process by repeatedly taking every second element until one element remains.\n\n    #### Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def generate_fibonacci_last_digits():\n        last_digits = [0, 1]\n        for i in range(2, 60):\n            last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)\n        return last_digits\n\n    def find_last_remaining_number(N):\n        last_digits = generate_fibonacci_last_digits()\n        position = (N - 1) % 60\n        while position > 0:\n            position = position // 2\n        return last_digits[position]\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = find_last_remaining_number(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    #### Lessons Learned\n    The key takeaway is the importance of understanding the periodic nature of sequences and how it can be leveraged to simplify complex problems. Additionally, correctly simulating processes that involve iterative reductions is crucial for solving such problems accurately.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.\n        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.\n        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.\n\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\n        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.\n        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each test case print required answer.\n\n        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=1000000\n        Subtask 3: 5 points\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=16\n        - 1<=Q<=1000\n        Subtask 1: 25 points\n        - T=1\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=100000\n        Subtask 2: 70 points\n        - Original Constraints.\n\n        -----Example:-----\n        Input:\n\n        1\n\n        3 3\n\n        1 2\n\n        2 1\n\n        3 2\n\n        Output:\n\n        0\n\n        2\n\n        2\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        For N=3\n\n        total subsets are:\n\n        {1}\n\n        {2}\n\n        {3}\n\n        {1,2}\n\n        {1,3}\n\n        {2,3}\n\n        {1,2,3}\n\n        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.\n\n        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.\n\n        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ### Problem Restatement\n\n        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.\n\n        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \\(C(I-1, K-1)\\).\n\n        3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \\(2^{N-I}\\) possible combinations.\n\n        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i from 2 to max_n:\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod-2, mod)\n            for i from max_n-1 down to 1:\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod\n\n        function solve_queries(T, queries, mod):\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod)\n            results = []\n            for each test case:\n                read N and Q\n                for each query:\n                    read I and K\n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverses, mod)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N-I, mod)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % mod\n                        results.append(result)\n            return results\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)\n            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod\n\n        def solve_queries():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, MOD)\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                        results.append(result)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)) + \"\\n\")\n        ```\n\n        This code efficiently handles the problem by precomputing factorials and their inverses, allowing for quick computation of binomial coefficients and powers of 2, which are essential for solving each query.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['1', '3 3', '1 2', '2 1', '3 2'] Expected output: [{'0'}, {'2'}, {'2'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.

Additionally, ensuring that all arithmetic operations were performed modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) was essential to prevent overflow and meet problem constraints.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The problem highlighted the importance of understanding mathematical properties (like the Pisano period) to optimize algorithms for large inputs.\n- Future attempts should focus on ensuring that all parts of the solution correctly apply these properties and handle edge cases effectively."

This method is based on matrix exponentiation and allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time, which is crucial given the large constraints of the problem.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic:**\n   - The solution makes extensive use of modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. This is a common technique in competitive programming to ensure calculations remain within manageable limits.\n\n3. **Mathematical Insight:**\n   - The official solution leverages mathematical properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic to derive a formula for the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to a power. This involves using the properties of modular inverses and powers, which are not immediately obvious but are powerful tools in reducing computational complexity.\n\n4. **Comparison with My Approach:**\n   - My initial approach attempted to use the Pisano period to reduce the problem size, but it was not correctly implemented to handle the large constraints. The official solution, on the other hand, directly computes the required sum using a derived formula, which is more efficient and avoids the pitfalls of handling large sequences directly.\n\n5. **Key Takeaway:**\n   - The problem highlights the importance of understanding mathematical properties and efficient algorithms (like fast doubling for Fibonacci) in solving problems with large constraints. It also underscores the need to carefully apply modular arithmetic to ensure correctness and efficiency.\n\nIn future problems, considering mathematical derivations and efficient algorithms can significantly improve both the correctness and performance of the solution."
