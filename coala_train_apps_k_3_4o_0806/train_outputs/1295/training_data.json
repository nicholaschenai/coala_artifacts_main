    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Fibonacci Power Sum Problem\n\n**Core Concepts:**\n- The problem involves calculating the sum of the first \\( N \\) Fibonacci numbers, each raised to the power of \\( K \\), for multiple queries.\n- Given the constraints where \\( N \\) and \\( K \\) can be as large as \\( 10^{18} \\), direct computation is infeasible.\n- The key concept is leveraging the Pisano period, which is the cycle length of Fibonacci numbers modulo a number, to reduce computational complexity.\n\n**Strategies and Challenges:**\n- **Pisano Period:** Initially, the Pisano period was calculated correctly, but its application in reducing the problem size was not fully optimized.\n- **Modular Arithmetic:** The use of modular arithmetic was crucial to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. However, ensuring that all operations correctly applied the modulus was a challenge.\n- **Loop Logic:** The logic to handle full periods and the remainder of \\( N \\) was initially flawed, leading to incorrect results.\n\n**Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**\n- **Runtime Errors:** The code faced runtime errors due to inefficient handling of large numbers and incorrect loop logic.\n- **Fixes:** The solution required careful handling of the Pisano period to ensure that only necessary Fibonacci numbers were computed. Additionally, ensuring that all arithmetic operations were performed modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) was essential to prevent overflow and meet problem constraints.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The problem highlighted the importance of understanding mathematical properties (like the Pisano period) to optimize algorithms for large inputs.\n- Future attempts should focus on ensuring that all parts of the solution correctly apply these properties and handle edge cases effectively.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and learnings:\n\n1. **Efficient Fibonacci Calculation:**\n   - The official solution uses a fast doubling method to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. This method is based on matrix exponentiation and allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time, which is crucial given the large constraints of the problem.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic:**\n   - The solution makes extensive use of modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. This is a common technique in competitive programming to ensure calculations remain within manageable limits.\n\n3. **Mathematical Insight:**\n   - The official solution leverages mathematical properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic to derive a formula for the sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to a power. This involves using the properties of modular inverses and powers, which are not immediately obvious but are powerful tools in reducing computational complexity.\n\n4. **Comparison with My Approach:**\n   - My initial approach attempted to use the Pisano period to reduce the problem size, but it was not correctly implemented to handle the large constraints. The official solution, on the other hand, directly computes the required sum using a derived formula, which is more efficient and avoids the pitfalls of handling large sequences directly.\n\n5. **Key Takeaway:**\n   - The problem highlights the importance of understanding mathematical properties and efficient algorithms (like fast doubling for Fibonacci) in solving problems with large constraints. It also underscores the need to carefully apply modular arithmetic to ensure correctness and efficiency.\n\nIn future problems, considering mathematical derivations and efficient algorithms can significantly improve both the correctness and performance of the solution.",
