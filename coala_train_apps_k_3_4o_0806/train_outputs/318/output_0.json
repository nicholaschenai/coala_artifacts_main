    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   You have a circular array of pizza slices, and you need to pick slices in a way that maximizes the total size of the slices you pick. You pick a slice, then your friends Alice and Bob pick the slices next to yours in opposite directions. This continues until all slices are picked. The goal is to maximize the sum of the sizes of the slices you pick.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Since the array is circular, we need to consider two scenarios: one where we exclude the first slice and one where we exclude the last slice. This is because picking a slice affects the availability of its neighboring slices. We can use a dynamic programming table to keep track of the maximum sum of slices we can pick up to a certain point, considering the constraints of the problem.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a helper function to calculate the maximum sum of slices for a linear array:\n     - Initialize a DP array with dimensions (n+1) x (n//3+1) filled with zeros\n     - Iterate over the slices array\n       - For each slice, update the DP table considering the choice of picking or not picking the slice\n     - Return the maximum value from the DP table\n\n   In the main function:\n     - Calculate the maximum sum by excluding the first slice\n     - Calculate the maximum sum by excluding the last slice\n     - Return the maximum of the two results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSizeSlices(self, slices: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Helper function to calculate the maximum sum of slices for a linear array\n        def maxSum(slices: List[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(slices)\n            # DP table where dp[i][j] is the max sum we can get with the first i slices and j picks\n            dp = [[0] * (n // 3 + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n            \n            for i in range(1, n + 1):\n                for j in range(1, n // 3 + 1):\n                    # Either we take the current slice or we don't\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], (dp[i - 2][j - 1] + slices[i - 1] if i > 1 else 0))\n            \n            return dp[n][n // 3]\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum sum by excluding the first slice\n        max1 = maxSum(slices[1:])\n        # Calculate the maximum sum by excluding the last slice\n        max2 = maxSum(slices[:-1])\n        \n        # Return the maximum of the two results\n        return max(max1, max2)\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the maximum sum of slices you can pick, considering the circular nature of the array by evaluating two linear scenarios.",
