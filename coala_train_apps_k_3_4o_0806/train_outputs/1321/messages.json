The series is defined by a specific pattern, and we need to determine this pattern to compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: \n   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...\n   - By examining the differences between consecutive terms, we can identify a pattern:\n     - 1 - 0 = 1\n     - 5 - 1 = 4\n     - 14 - 5 = 9\n     - 30 - 14 = 16\n     - 55 - 30 = 25\n   - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...\n\n2. **Formulate the Series**:\n   - The N'th term can be expressed as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n   - The formula for the N'th term is: `S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (N-1)^2`.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - Use the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n   - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term in constant time.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula and output the result.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction sum_of_squares(n):\n    return (n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) // 6\n\nfunction find_nth_term(N):\n    if N == 1:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return sum_of_squares(N-1)\n\nread T\nfor each test case:\n    read N\n    result = find_nth_term(N)\n    print result\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(n):\n    # Calculate the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers\n    return (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6\n\ndef find_nth_term(N):\n    # If N is 1, the term is 0\n    if N == 1:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, calculate the sum of squares up to (N-1)\n        return sum_of_squares(N - 1)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        result = find_nth_term(N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code reads input from standard input, computes the N'th term for each test case using the derived formula, and outputs the results.

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.\n    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.\n    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct fixed this issue.\n    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.\n    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n        scores = [10] * N\n        for i, j, k in questions:\n            for student in range(i, j + 1):\n                scores[student] *= k\n        total_score = sum(scores)\n        mean_score = total_score // N\n        return mean_score\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            M = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            questions = []\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i = int(data[index]) - 1\n                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n                k = int(data[index + 2])\n                index += 3\n                questions.append((i, j, k))\n            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n            results.append(result)\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to compute the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at each time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. This results in a factorial-like growth, which can become very large, so the challenge was to compute this efficiently using modular arithmetic.\n\n    The key strategy was to use a loop to compute the product of numbers from `1` to `N`, multiplied by `X`, and take the result modulo `10^6 + 3` at each step to prevent overflow and keep the computation efficient. This approach leverages the properties of modular arithmetic, which allows us to take the modulo at each multiplication step without affecting the final result.\n\n    The solution was implemented in Python, using a function to handle the computation for each test case and reading input directly from standard input for efficiency, given the potentially large number of test cases. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness and efficiency of the approach. This problem reinforced the importance of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers and factorial-like computations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
