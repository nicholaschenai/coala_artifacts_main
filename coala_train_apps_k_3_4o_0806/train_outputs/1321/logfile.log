INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... and need to find the N'th number in this series for multiple test cases. The series is defined by a specific pattern, and we need to determine this pattern to compute the N'th term efficiently.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   - By examining the differences between consecutive terms, we can identify a pattern:
     - 1 - 0 = 1
     - 5 - 1 = 4
     - 14 - 5 = 9
     - 30 - 14 = 16
     - 55 - 30 = 25
   - The differences are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

2. **Formulate the Series**:
   - The N'th term can be expressed as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.
   - The formula for the N'th term is: `S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (N-1)^2`.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Use the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
   - This formula allows us to compute the N'th term in constant time.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula and output the result.

## Pseudocode

```
function sum_of_squares(n):
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) // 6

function find_nth_term(N):
    if N == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return sum_of_squares(N-1)

read T
for each test case:
    read N
    result = find_nth_term(N)
    print result
```

## Python Code

```python
def sum_of_squares(n):
    # Calculate the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6

def find_nth_term(N):
    # If N is 1, the term is 0
    if N == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        # Otherwise, calculate the sum of squares up to (N-1)
        return sum_of_squares(N - 1)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for i in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(data[i])
        result = find_nth_term(N)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

main()
```

This code reads input from standard input, computes the N'th term for each test case using the derived formula, and outputs the results. The use of the sum of squares formula ensures that each term is computed efficiently in constant time.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum of a subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.

    #### Strategies and Mistakes
    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.

    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.

    ### Code Snippet

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            n, strengths = test_case
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
            alternating_sum = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]
                else:
                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]
            results.append(alternating_sum)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
            test_cases.append((n, strengths))
    
        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to compute the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at each time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. This results in a factorial-like growth, which can become very large, so the challenge was to compute this efficiently using modular arithmetic.

    The key strategy was to use a loop to compute the product of numbers from `1` to `N`, multiplied by `X`, and take the result modulo `10^6 + 3` at each step to prevent overflow and keep the computation efficient. This approach leverages the properties of modular arithmetic, which allows us to take the modulo at each multiplication step without affecting the final result.

    The solution was implemented in Python, using a function to handle the computation for each test case and reading input directly from standard input for efficiency, given the potentially large number of test cases. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness and efficiency of the approach. This problem reinforced the importance of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers and factorial-like computations.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer N, and we need to output the N'th number in the series.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
   - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   - The differences between consecutive terms are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
   - These differences are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...

2. **Formulate the Series**:
   - The N'th term can be expressed as a sum of squares: 
     - \( S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + (N-1)^2 \)
   - This is a known mathematical series where the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers is given by:
     - \( S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \)

3. **Plan the Solution**:
   - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula for the sum of squares.
   - Output the result for each test case.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_nth_term(N):
    return (N-1) * N * (2*N-1) // 6

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N
        result = calculate_nth_term(N)
        print result
```

### Final Python Solution

def calculate_nth_term(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] In this problem, I was tasked with finding the N'th term in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., for multiple test cases. The key to solving this problem was identifying the pattern in the series. The differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc. This led to the realization that the N'th term can be expressed as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

The formula for the sum of squares is:
\[ S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \]

This formula allowed for efficient computation of the N'th term, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases and N values). The solution involved reading all input at once for efficiency, computing the result for each test case using the formula, and then outputting the results.

The approach was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful without any errors. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and leveraging known formulas for efficient computation.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    n=int(input())
    if n==1:
        print("0")
    else:
        n=n-2
        l=(n+1)*(2*n+3)*(n+2)/6
        print(int(l))


INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution aim to find the N'th term in a series defined by a specific pattern. The series is generated by summing the squares of integers starting from 1. My approach used a direct mathematical formula for the sum of squares, which is efficient and straightforward.

### Key Insights:

1. **Mathematical Formula**: Both solutions rely on the mathematical formula for the sum of squares, which is a well-known formula: \( S(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2N-1)}{6} \). This formula allows us to compute the N'th term in constant time, \( O(1) \).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes a specific check for when \( N = 1 \), directly returning 0. This is a simple but important step to handle the base case of the series.

3. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient in terms of time complexity, as they compute the result in constant time for each test case. This is crucial given the constraints, where \( T \) and \( N \) can be as large as 10,000.

4. **Differences in Implementation**: The official solution uses a slightly different approach by adjusting \( N \) before applying the formula. It subtracts 2 from \( N \) and then applies a modified version of the formula. This approach works because it effectively shifts the series to start from the second term, aligning with the series' pattern.

Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively leverage the mathematical properties of the series to compute the desired terms efficiently. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding and applying mathematical formulas to solve problems involving series or sequences.
