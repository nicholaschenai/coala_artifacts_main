    "summary": "In this problem, I was tasked with finding the N'th term in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., for multiple test cases. The key to solving this problem was identifying the pattern in the series. The differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc. This led to the realization that the N'th term can be expressed as the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\nThe formula for the sum of squares is:\n\\[ S(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2N-1)}{6} \\]\n\nThis formula allowed for efficient computation of the N'th term, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases and N values). The solution involved reading all input at once for efficiency, computing the result for each test case using the formula, and then outputting the results.\n\nThe approach was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful without any errors. This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and leveraging known formulas for efficient computation.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, both my solution and the official solution aim to find the N'th term in a series defined by a specific pattern. The series is generated by summing the squares of integers starting from 1. My approach used a direct mathematical formula for the sum of squares, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Mathematical Formula**: Both solutions rely on the mathematical formula for the sum of squares, which is a well-known formula: \\( S(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2N-1)}{6} \\). This formula allows us to compute the N'th term in constant time, \\( O(1) \\).\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes a specific check for when \\( N = 1 \\), directly returning 0. This is a simple but important step to handle the base case of the series.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: Both solutions are efficient in terms of time complexity, as they compute the result in constant time for each test case. This is crucial given the constraints, where \\( T \\) and \\( N \\) can be as large as 10,000.\n\n4. **Differences in Implementation**: The official solution uses a slightly different approach by adjusting \\( N \\) before applying the formula. It subtracts 2 from \\( N \\) and then applies a modified version of the formula. This approach works because it effectively shifts the series to start from the second term, aligning with the series' pattern.\n\nOverall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively leverage the mathematical properties of the series to compute the desired terms efficiently. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding and applying mathematical formulas to solve problems involving series or sequences.",

The problem involves understanding how to derive a formula for a series and then efficiently compute terms of the series for large inputs, which is common in competitive programming and algorithm design.
