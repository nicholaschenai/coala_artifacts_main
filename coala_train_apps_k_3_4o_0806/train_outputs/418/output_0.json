    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the minimum number of operations required to transform a given positive integer `n` into `1`. The operations allowed are:\n   - If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.\n   - If `n` is odd, replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The goal is to reduce `n` to `1` using the fewest operations. If `n` is even, the best move is to divide it by 2, as this reduces `n` significantly. If `n` is odd, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice should be made based on which operation will lead to a faster reduction to `1`. Generally, if `n + 1` or `n - 1` results in a number that is divisible by 4, it is often beneficial to choose that path, as it allows for a subsequent division by 2. However, a special case is when `n` is `3`, where decrementing to `2` is optimal.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function integerReplacement(n):\n       initialize steps to 0\n       while n is not 1:\n           if n is even:\n               divide n by 2\n           else:\n               if n is 3 or n - 1 is divisible by 4:\n                   decrement n by 1\n               else:\n                   increment n by 1\n           increment steps by 1\n       return steps\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n        steps = 0\n        while n != 1:\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                # If n is even, divide by 2\n                n //= 2\n            else:\n                # If n is odd, decide whether to increment or decrement\n                # Prefer decrement if n is 3 or n-1 is divisible by 4\n                if n == 3 or (n & 2) == 0:\n                    n -= 1\n                else:\n                    n += 1\n            # Increment the step count\n            steps += 1\n        return steps\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently reduces `n` to `1` by making optimal choices at each step, ensuring the minimum number of operations.",
