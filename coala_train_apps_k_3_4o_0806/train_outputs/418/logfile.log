INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a positive integer `n`. We need to transform `n` into `1` using the fewest number of operations. The operations allowed are:
- If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.
- If `n` is odd, replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers:
- For even numbers, the best operation is to divide by 2, as it reduces the number significantly.
- For odd numbers, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice should be made based on which operation will lead to a faster reduction to `1`.

For odd numbers:
- If `n` is `3`, decrementing to `2` is optimal because `2` can be halved to `1` in one step.
- For other odd numbers, we should consider the binary representation of `n`. If `n + 1` has more trailing zeros than `n - 1`, it is generally better to increment because it will lead to more divisions by 2 in subsequent steps.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a counter `steps` to 0.
2. While `n` is not equal to 1:
   - If `n` is even, divide `n` by 2.
   - If `n` is odd:
     - If `n` is 3, decrement `n` to 2.
     - Otherwise, check the number of trailing zeros in `n + 1` and `n - 1`.
     - If `n + 1` has more trailing zeros, increment `n`.
     - Otherwise, decrement `n`.
   - Increment the `steps` counter.
3. Return the `steps` counter.

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
        steps = 0
        while n != 1:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                # If n is even, divide by 2
                n //= 2
            else:
                # If n is odd
                if n == 3:
                    # Special case for 3, decrement to 2
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    # Check the number of trailing zeros in n+1 and n-1
                    if (n + 1) % 4 == 0 and n != 3:
                        n += 1
                    else:
                        n -= 1
            steps += 1
        return steps
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize `steps` to count the number of operations.
- We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.
- For even `n`, we simply divide by 2.
- For odd `n`, we handle the special case of `3` separately by decrementing to `2`.
- For other odd numbers, we decide between incrementing or decrementing based on the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of `n + 1` and `n - 1`.
- We increment the `steps` counter for each operation performed.
- Finally, we return the total number of steps taken to reduce `n` to `1`.

    Title: Josephus Problem
    Part: 1/1
    # Josephus Problem

    ## Statement

    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.
    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. 
    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.
    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.
    The process stops when one number remains.
    It is required to find the last number.

    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).

    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.
    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \log n)$.
    We want something better though.

    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution

    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.

    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:

    $$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
    n\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\
    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\
    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\
    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\
    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\
    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\
    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\
    \end{array}$$

    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:

    $$J_{n,k} = \left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \bmod n \right) + 1$$

    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$

    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:

    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \bmod n$$

    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.

    ## Implementation

    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;
    }
    ```

    **Non-recursive form** :

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
      	  res = (res + k) % i;
        return res + 1;
    }
    ```

    This formula can also be found analytically.
    Again here we assume 0-indexing.
    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.
    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \bmod n$.
    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \ \bmod n$.

    ## Modeling a $O(k \log n)$ solution

    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.
    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$) in one run without looping over.
    Afterwards we have $n - \lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k)$-th number.
    So we have to shift by that many.
    We can notice that $\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k$ is simply $-n \bmod k$.
    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.
    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.

    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.

    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;
        if (k == 1)
            return n-1;
        if (k > n)
            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;
        int cnt = n / k;
        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);
        res -= n % k;
        if (res < 0)
            res += n;
        else
            res += res / (k - 1);
        return res;
    }
    ```

    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:

    $$ n \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) ^ x = 1, $$

    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:

    $$\ln n + x \ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) = 0,$$ 
    $$x = - \frac{\ln n}{\ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)},$$

    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:

    $$x \approx k \ln n$$

    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \log n)$.

    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$

    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.

    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):

    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$

    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:

    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$

    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, "restarting" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:

    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \left(n-2^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor} \right)$$

    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$

    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler "The Josephus Problem" and Odlyzko, Wilf "Functional iteration and the Josephus problem").

    [Task]:
        Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
        He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
        21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
        Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The problem with the current solution is likely related to how the input is being read and processed. The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads from standard input and processes the data is never executed. This is a common issue when dealing with standard input/output in competitive programming environments.

        ### Steps to Fix the Issue

        1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` should be called to execute the logic.
        2. **Check Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly from standard input and processed as expected.
        3. **Output the Result**: Make sure the result is printed to standard output.

        ### Revised Solution

        To address these issues, we need to ensure that the function is called and that the input/output is handled correctly. Here's the revised solution:

        ```python
        def min_moves_to_sort_books():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            N = int(data[0])
            books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
            def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
                low, high = 0, len(lis)
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if lis[mid] < book:
                        low = mid + 1

            print(min_moves)

        # Call the function to execute the solution
        min_moves_to_sort_books()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes

        - **Function Call**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings, which are then processed to extract the number of books and their current order.
        - **Output**: The result is printed directly to standard output, which is expected in competitive programming environments.

        These changes should ensure that the solution reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the correct result.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly. Here's the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def min_moves_to_sort_books():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            N = int(data[0])
            books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
            def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
                low, high = 0, len(lis)
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if lis[mid] < book:
                        low = mid + 1
                    else:
                        high = mid
                return low
    
            lis = []
            for book in books:
                pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
                if pos == len(lis):
                    lis.append(book)
                else:
                    lis[pos] = book
    
            min_moves = N - len(lis)
            print(min_moves)

        # Call the function to execute the solution
        min_moves_to_sort_books()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **Function Call**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings, which are then processed to extract the number of books and their current order.
        - **Binary Search for LIS**: A helper function `binary_search_lis` is used to find the position where a book can be placed in the `lis` to maintain the increasing order.
        - **Building the LIS**: We iterate over each book and use the helper function to determine where it fits in the `lis`. If the position is at the end of `lis`, we append the book; otherwise, we replace the existing element at that position.
        - **Output**: The result, which is the minimum number of moves, is printed directly to standard output. 

        These changes ensure that the solution reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the correct result.

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was similar to the official one, both in logic and efficiency. However, the official solution uses a slightly different approach to calculate the sum of multiples of 10, which is worth noting for its simplicity.

    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

    1. **Simplified Calculation**:
       - The official solution directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N by adjusting N with `n -= n % 10`.
       - It then divides by 10 to get the number of terms `n` in the series.

    2. **Direct Use of Arithmetic Series Formula**:
       - The formula used is `n * (n + 1) / 2 * 10`, which directly computes the sum of the series without explicitly calculating the last term `m` as in my solution.
       - This approach is concise and leverages the arithmetic series formula effectively.

    3. **Efficiency**:
       - Both solutions are efficient with a time complexity of O(1) per test case, as they involve simple arithmetic operations.

    ### Reflection:

    The official solution is a good reminder of how sometimes a direct approach can be more elegant and concise. It simplifies the calculation by reducing the number of steps and variables involved. This experience reinforces the importance of revisiting mathematical formulas and leveraging them directly when possible to simplify code.

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the minimum number of operations required to transform a given positive integer `n` into `1`. The operations allowed are:
   - If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.
   - If `n` is odd, replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The goal is to reduce `n` to `1` using the fewest operations. If `n` is even, the best move is to divide it by 2, as this reduces `n` significantly. If `n` is odd, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice should be made based on which operation will lead to a faster reduction to `1`. Generally, if `n + 1` or `n - 1` results in a number that is divisible by 4, it is often beneficial to choose that path, as it allows for a subsequent division by 2. However, a special case is when `n` is `3`, where decrementing to `2` is optimal.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function integerReplacement(n):
       initialize steps to 0
       while n is not 1:
           if n is even:
               divide n by 2
           else:
               if n is 3 or n - 1 is divisible by 4:

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The challenge was to determine the optimal path to minimize the number of operations.

The core concept here was to leverage the properties of even and odd numbers. For even numbers, dividing by 2 is straightforward and optimal. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, as this would allow for further division by 2 in subsequent steps. A special case was when `n` was `3`, where decrementing to `2` was optimal.

The solution involved a loop that continued until `n` became `1`, applying the appropriate operation at each step and counting the number of operations. The strategy of checking divisibility by 4 for odd numbers proved effective in minimizing the steps.

The implementation was straightforward, and the logic was verified by passing the provided test cases. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on future outcomes. The solution was efficient and did not encounter any unexpected errors. Here is the final code:

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] The problem of reducing a number `n` to `1` using the minimum number of operations is a classic example of a greedy algorithm. The key insight is to make decisions at each step that will lead to the fastest reduction of `n`.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Recursive vs Iterative Approach:**
   - The official solution initially presents a recursive approach (commented out) that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. It checks if `n` is even or odd and recursively calls itself with the appropriate operation. This approach is elegant but can be inefficient due to repeated calculations and potential stack overflow for large `n`.
   - The iterative approach, which is implemented, avoids these issues by using a loop to iteratively reduce `n`. This is more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.

2. **Handling Odd Numbers:**
   - The decision-making process for odd numbers is crucial. The solution uses the property of numbers modulo 4 to decide whether to increment or decrement:
     - If `n % 4 == 1` or `n == 3`, decrementing is preferred. This is because decrementing will often lead to a number that can be divided by 2 in the next step.
     - Otherwise, incrementing is preferred, as it will lead to a number that is divisible by 4, allowing for a more significant reduction in subsequent steps.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The iterative approach is efficient because it reduces the problem size in each step without the overhead of recursive calls. It also uses a simple loop and a few conditional checks, making it both time and space efficient.

### Reflection:

The official solution aligns closely with my initial approach, particularly in the iterative handling of the problem. The use of modulo operations to decide the best path for odd numbers is a key optimization that ensures the minimum number of steps. This problem reinforces the importance of understanding number properties (like divisibility) and how they can be leveraged in algorithm design. The iterative approach is generally preferable for problems like this due to its efficiency and simplicity.
