    "raw_msg": "To solve the problem of finding the number of \"nice\" subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers, we can use a sliding window approach with a hash map to efficiently count the subarrays. Here's how we can break down the problem and solution:\n\n### 1. Restate the Problem\nWe need to find the number of contiguous subarrays within a given array `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a Solution\n- **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify which numbers in the array are odd.\n- **Use a Prefix Sum Approach**: We can use a prefix sum approach to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far as we iterate through the array.\n- **Count Subarrays with Exactly `k` Odd Numbers**: For each position in the array, we can determine how many subarrays end at that position and contain exactly `k` odd numbers by using a hash map to store the count of prefix sums.\n\n### 3. Pseudocode Solution\n1. Initialize a hash map `count` to store the frequency of prefix sums, starting with `count[0] = 1` to handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning.\n2. Initialize `odd_count` to 0 to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.\n3. Initialize `result` to 0 to store the number of nice subarrays.\n4. Iterate over each number in `nums`:\n   - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.\n   - If `odd_count - k` exists in `count`, it means there are subarrays ending at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers. Add the frequency of `odd_count - k` to `result`.\n   - Update the frequency of `odd_count` in `count`.\n5. Return `result`.\n\n### 4. Final Python Solution\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums\n        count = defaultdict(int)\n        count[0] = 1  # To handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning\n        \n        odd_count = 0  # To keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered\n        result = 0  # To store the number of nice subarrays\n        \n        for num in nums:\n            # Increment odd_count if the current number is odd\n            if num % 2 == 1:\n                odd_count += 1\n            \n            # If there exists a prefix with odd_count - k, it means there are subarrays\n            # ending at the current position with exactly k odd numbers\n            if odd_count - k in count:\n                result += count[odd_count - k]\n            \n            # Update the frequency of the current odd_count\n            count[odd_count] += 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- We use a hash map `count` to store the frequency of each prefix sum of odd numbers.\n- `odd_count` keeps track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.\n- For each number in `nums`, we update `odd_count` and check if there is a prefix sum that would result in exactly `k` odd numbers in the current subarray.\n- The solution efficiently counts the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers using a single pass through the array, resulting in an O(n) time complexity.",
