INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays within `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

## Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, identify the positions of all odd numbers in the array.
   - Use these positions to determine the subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.
   - For each subarray with exactly `k` odd numbers, calculate the number of possible subarrays by considering the number of even numbers before the first odd number and after the last odd number in the subarray.
   - Use a sliding window approach to efficiently count these subarrays.

## Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a list `odd_indices` to store indices of odd numbers in `nums`.
   Iterate over `nums` and populate `odd_indices` with indices of odd numbers.
   
   Initialize `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of nice subarrays.
   
   Iterate over `odd_indices` with a window of size `k`:
       - For each window, calculate the number of even numbers before the first odd number in the window.
       - Calculate the number of even numbers after the last odd number in the window.
       - The number of nice subarrays for this window is the product of the two calculated numbers.
       - Add this product to `count`.
   
   Return `count`.
   ```

## Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Find all indices of odd numbers in the array
        odd_indices = []
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num % 2 == 1:
                odd_indices.append(i)
        
        # Step 2: Initialize the count of nice subarrays
        count = 0
        
        # Step 3: Iterate over the odd indices with a window of size k
        for i in range(len(odd_indices) - k + 1):
            # Start and end of the current window of k odd numbers
            start = odd_indices[i]
            end = odd_indices[i + k - 1]
            
            # Calculate the number of even numbers before the first odd number in the window
            if i == 0:
                left_even_count = start + 1
            else:
                left_even_count = start - odd_indices[i - 1]
            
            # Calculate the number of even numbers after the last odd number in the window
            if i + k == len(odd_indices):
                right_even_count = len(nums) - end
            else:
                right_even_count = odd_indices[i + k] - end
            
            # Add the number of nice subarrays for this window to the count
            count += left_even_count * right_even_count
        
        # Step 4: Return the total count of nice subarrays
        return count
```

This solution efficiently counts the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by leveraging the positions of odd numbers and calculating possible subarrays using a sliding window approach.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find the number of unique results from bitwise OR operations on all contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The core concept here is understanding how the bitwise OR operation works and how it can be efficiently computed over subarrays.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Bitwise OR**: This operation results in a number that has bits set to 1 wherever either of the original numbers had a bit set to 1. This means that as we extend a subarray, the OR result can only increase or stay the same.
    - **Set for Uniqueness**: Using a set to track unique OR results is crucial because it automatically handles duplicates, which is essential for counting unique results.

    ### Strategy:
    - For each element in the array, consider it as the starting point of a subarray.
    - Use a set to store OR results for subarrays ending at the current index.
    - Extend previous results by including the current element and update the set of results.
    - Add these results to a global set that tracks all unique OR results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    from typing import List

    class Solution:
        def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
            unique_results = set()
            current_results = set()
        
            for num in A:
                new_results = {num}
                for result in current_results:
                    new_results.add(result | num)
                current_results = new_results
                unique_results.update(current_results)
        
            return len(unique_results)
    ```

    This approach efficiently computes the unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to manage uniqueness. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency.

    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest subsequence where each number is greater than the previous one. The subsequence does not need to be contiguous, and we are only interested in the length of this subsequence.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We'll maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We initialize each `d[i]` to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element, we check all previous elements to see if they can be part of an increasing subsequence ending at the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the `d` array.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function lengthOfLIS(nums):
               if nums is empty:
                   return 0
       
               n = length of nums
               d = array of size n, initialized to 1
       
               for i from 1 to n-1:
                   for j from 0 to i-1:
                       if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                           d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
       
               return max value in d
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                # If the input list is empty, the longest increasing subsequence is 0
                if not nums:
                    return 0
        
                # Initialize the dynamic programming array with 1s
                # Each element is at least an increasing subsequence of length 1 (itself)
                n = len(nums)
                d = [1] * n
        
                # Iterate over each element in the list
                for i in range(1, n):
                    # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence
                    for j in range(i):
                        # If the current element is greater than a previous element
                        if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                            # Update the dp array to reflect the longest subsequence ending at i
                            d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
                # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the dp array
                return max(d)
        ```

        This solution uses dynamic programming to achieve an O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable for the problem constraints.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given an array `A` of non-negative integers. For every contiguous subarray `B` of `A`, we compute the bitwise OR of all elements in `B`. Our task is to return the number of unique results obtained from these bitwise OR operations.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number that has bits set to 1 wherever either of the original numbers had a bit set to 1. This means that the result of a bitwise OR operation can only increase or stay the same as we include more numbers in the subarray.

        2. **Tracking Unique Results**: We need to track all unique results of the bitwise OR operations. Using a set is ideal for this purpose because it automatically handles duplicates.

        3. **Iterative Approach**: 
           - For each element in the array, consider it as the starting point of a subarray.
           - Compute the bitwise OR for all subarrays starting from this element.
           - Use a set to keep track of all unique results.

        4. **Optimization Insight**: 
           - If we have a result from a subarray ending at a certain index, extending this subarray by one more element can only add more bits (or keep the same) to the result. Thus, we can build on previous results to avoid redundant calculations.

        ### Pseudocode

        1. Initialize a set `unique_results` to store unique OR results.
        2. For each element `A[i]` in the array:
           - Initialize a set `current_results` to store OR results for subarrays starting at `A[i]`.
           - Add `A[i]` to `current_results`.
           - For each result in `current_results`, compute the OR with `A[i]` and update `current_results`.

        ```python

                    new_results = {num}
            
                    # Extend each of the previous results with the current number
                    for result in current_results:
                        new_results.add(result | num)

                # The number of unique results is the answer
                return len(unique_results)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - We maintain a set `unique_results` to store all unique OR results.
        - For each number in the array, we compute new OR results by extending the previous results (`current_results`) with the current number.
        - We update `current_results` with these new results and add them to `unique_results`.
        - Finally, the size of `unique_results` gives us the number of unique OR results.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] To solve the problem of finding the number of "nice" subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers, we can use a sliding window approach with a hash map to efficiently count the subarrays. Here's how we can break down the problem and solution:

### 1. Restate the Problem
We need to find the number of contiguous subarrays within a given array `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

### 2. Conceptualize a Solution
- **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify which numbers in the array are odd.
- **Use a Prefix Sum Approach**: We can use a prefix sum approach to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far as we iterate through the array.
- **Count Subarrays with Exactly `k` Odd Numbers**: For each position in the array, we can determine how many subarrays end at that position and contain exactly `k` odd numbers by using a hash map to store the count of prefix sums.

### 3. Pseudocode Solution
1. Initialize a hash map `count` to store the frequency of prefix sums, starting with `count[0] = 1` to handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning.
2. Initialize `odd_count` to 0 to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.
3. Initialize `result` to 0 to store the number of nice subarrays.
4. Iterate over each number in `nums`:
   - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.
   - If `odd_count - k` exists in `count`, it means there are subarrays ending at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers. Add the frequency of `odd_count - k` to `result`.
   - Update the frequency of `odd_count` in `count`.
5. Return `result`.

### 4. Final Python Solution
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums
        count = defaultdict(int)
        count[0] = 1  # To handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning
        
        odd_count = 0  # To keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered
        result = 0  # To store the number of nice subarrays
        
        for num in nums:
            # Increment odd_count if the current number is odd
            if num % 2 == 1:
                odd_count += 1
            
            # If there exists a prefix with odd_count - k, it means there are subarrays
            # ending at the current position with exactly k odd numbers
            if odd_count - k in count:
                result += count[odd_count - k]
            
            # Update the frequency of the current odd_count
            count[odd_count] += 1
        
        return result
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We use a hash map `count` to store the frequency of each prefix sum of odd numbers.
- `odd_count` keeps track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.
- For each number in `nums`, we update `odd_count` and check if there is a prefix sum that would result in exactly `k` odd numbers in the current subarray.
- The solution efficiently counts the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers using a single pass through the array, resulting in an O(n) time complexity.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] In solving the problem of finding the number of "nice" subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers, I utilized a sliding window approach combined with a prefix sum strategy. The core concept was to efficiently count subarrays by tracking the number of odd numbers encountered as we iterate through the array. This was achieved using a hash map to store the frequency of prefix sums of odd numbers.

The key steps involved:
1. **Prefix Sum of Odd Numbers**: By maintaining a running count of odd numbers (`odd_count`), we could determine how many subarrays end at each position with exactly `k` odd numbers.
2. **Hash Map for Frequency Counting**: A hash map (`count`) was used to store the frequency of each prefix sum, allowing us to quickly check how many subarrays have the required number of odd numbers.
3. **Single Pass Efficiency**: The solution was designed to work in O(n) time complexity by making a single pass through the array, updating the hash map and result as we go.

This approach was effective and passed all test cases, demonstrating the power of combining prefix sums with hash maps for efficient subarray counting. The problem reinforced the utility of these techniques in handling subarray problems with specific constraints.

- For each number in `nums`, we update `odd_count` and check if there is a prefix sum that would result in exactly `k` odd numbers in the current subarray.
- The solution efficiently counts the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers using a single pass through the array, resulting in an O(n) time complexity.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem of finding the number of "nice" subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers, both my solution and the official solution effectively solve the problem, but they approach it differently.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:
1. **Edge Array**: The official solution uses an "edge" array to store the lengths of even-numbered segments between odd numbers. This is a clever way to handle the problem because it directly relates to how many subarrays can be formed with exactly `k` odd numbers.
   
2. **Combination Calculation**: By storing the lengths of even segments, the solution calculates the number of valid subarrays by multiplying the lengths of segments before and after a group of `k` odd numbers. This is efficient because it reduces the problem to simple arithmetic operations on the lengths of these segments.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution checks if there are enough odd numbers to form a subarray with `k` odd numbers early on, which can save unnecessary calculations.

### Comparison with My Approach:
- **Prefix Sum vs. Edge Array**: My approach used a prefix sum and hash map to track the number of odd numbers encountered, which is a common technique for subarray problems. The official solution's use of the edge array is more direct and potentially more intuitive for this specific problem.
  
- **Efficiency**: Both solutions have a time complexity of O(n), but the official solution might have a slight edge in terms of constant factors due to its straightforward arithmetic operations.

### Conclusion:
The official solution provides an insightful alternative approach by focusing on the structure of the array in terms of even segments between odd numbers. This method is particularly effective for this problem and highlights the importance of considering different perspectives when tackling array-based problems. In future problems, considering the structure and characteristics of the data can lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.

It uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of prefix sums of odd numbers encountered so far. As it iterates through the list, it increments a counter whenever an odd number is found and checks if there is a previously seen prefix sum that would result in a subarray with exactly `k` odd numbers. If such a prefix sum exists, it adds the frequency of that prefix sum to the result. The function returns the total count of such subarrays.
