## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the length of array $a$.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)Â â€” the elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer in single line â€” the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.


-----Example-----
Input
3
5
2 1 1 2 2
6
1 2 1 1 3 2
9
3 1 2 2 1 6 6 3 3

Output
4
1
8



-----Note-----

In the first query there are four stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 4} = [2, 1, 1, 2], a_{2 \ldots 3} = [1, 1], a_{2 \ldots 5} = [1, 1, 2, 2], a_{4 \ldots 5} = [2, 2]$.

In the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarrayÂ â€” $a_{3 \ldots 4}$.

In the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 8}, a_{2 \ldots 5}, a_{2 \ldots 7}, a_{2 \ldots 9}, a_{3 \ldots 4}, a_{6 \ldots 7}, a_{6 \ldots 9}, a_{8 \ldots 9}$.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given multiple queries, each with an array of integers. For each query, we need to determine how many subarrays of the given array are "stack exterminable." A subarray is stack exterminable if, when processed through a specific stack operation, the stack ends up empty. The stack operation involves pushing elements onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case the top element is popped instead.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Stack Extermination**: 
   - We need to simulate a stack where we push elements unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case we pop the stack.
   - A subarray is stack exterminable if, after processing all its elements, the stack is empty.

2. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - For each query, consider all possible subarrays of the given array.
   - For each subarray, simulate the stack operation to check if it is stack exterminable.
   - Count the number of stack exterminable subarrays.

3. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - The brute force approach involves checking all subarrays, which can be computationally expensive.
   - We need to ensure that the solution is efficient enough to handle the constraints, especially since the sum of all array lengths across queries can be large.

## Pseudocode

```
function is_stack_exterminable(subarray):
    initialize an empty stack
    for each element in subarray:
        if stack is not empty and stack top is equal to element:
            pop the stack
        else:
            push element onto the stack
    return true if stack is empty, else false

function count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(array):
    initialize count to 0
    for start in range(0, length of array):
        for end in range(start, length of array):
            subarray = array[start:end+1]
            if is_stack_exterminable(subarray):
                increment count
    return count

function process_queries(queries):
    for each query in queries:
        read n and array
        result = count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(array)
        print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_stack_exterminable(subarray):
    stack = []
    for element in subarray:
        if stack and stack[-1] == element:
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(element)
    return len(stack) == 0

def count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(array):
    count = 0
    n = len(array)
    for start in range(n):
        for end in range(start, n):
            subarray = array[start:end+1]
            if is_stack_exterminable(subarray):
                count += 1
    return count

def process_queries(queries):
    results = []
    for query in queries:
        n, array = query
        result = count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(array)
        results.append(result)
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
index = 0
q = int(data[index])
index += 1
queries = []
for _ in range(q):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    queries.append((n, array))

# Process queries and output results
results = process_queries(queries)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **`is_stack_exterminable`**: This function simulates the stack operation for a given subarray and checks if the stack is empty at the end.
- **`count_stack_exterminable_subarrays`**: This function iterates over all possible subarrays of the given array, uses `is_stack_exterminable` to check each one, and counts how many are stack exterminable.
- **`process_queries`**: This function processes each query, applies the counting function, and stores the results.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, parsed, and processed to extract the number of queries and the arrays for each query. The results are then printed.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the length of array $a$.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)Â â€” the elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer in single line â€” the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.


-----Example-----
Input
3
5
2 1 1 2 2
6
1 2 1 1 3 2
9
3 1 2 2 1 6 6 3 3

Output

-----Note-----

In the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarrayÂ â€” $a_{3 \ldots 4}$.

In the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 8}, a_{2 \ldots 5}, a_{2 \ldots 7}, a_{2 \ldots 9}, a_{3 \ldots 4}, a_{6 \ldots 7}, a_{6 \ldots 9}, a_{8 \ldots 9}$.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break to reach the origin from a given starting point, or if the starting point lies on a wall. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant, and the solution required efficient handling of multiple test cases with potentially large input sizes.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Set for Fast Lookup**: Using a set to store wall positions allowed for O(1) time complexity when checking if a starting point lies on a wall.
    - **Counting with Conditions**: The problem required counting how many wall positions are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point. This was efficiently handled by iterating over the sorted list of wall positions.

    ### Strategies
    - **Input Parsing and Management**: Efficiently parsing input and managing indices was crucial given the constraints.
    - **Iterative Counting**: Instead of using complex data structures, a simple iteration over the sorted list of wall positions was sufficient to count the walls Chef needs to break.

    ### Code Snippet
    ```python
    a_set = set(a)  # Convert list to set for O(1) lookup
    for _ in range(Q):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
    
        sum_xy = x + y
        if sum_xy in a_set:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            count = 0
            for ai in a:
                if ai > sum_xy:
                    count += 1
            results.append(count)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of using appropriate data structures for fast lookups and the simplicity of iterative solutions when dealing with sorted data. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts on the "Good Subtree" Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around understanding tree structures and identifying subtrees that can be represented by intersecting segments. The key insight is that the largest "good" subtree is the largest connected component that can be formed by removing the least number of edges. This involves recognizing that a tree with `n` nodes has `n-1` edges, and removing any edge will split the tree into two subtrees.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misinterpreted the problem by focusing on calculating subtree sizes using DFS, which led to incorrect results. The mistake was in not correctly identifying the specific requirement of forming a "good" subtree, which involves intersecting segments. The initial approach was to calculate the size of the subtree rooted at each node, but this did not align with the problem's requirements.

    The correct strategy is to realize that the largest good subtree is simply the entire tree minus one edge, which is `n - 1`. This is because removing any single edge from a tree of `n` nodes results in two subtrees, and the largest possible subtree is `n - 1`.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the output misalignment, where the expected output was not correctly matched with the calculated result. This was due to a misunderstanding of the problem requirements. The fix involved recognizing that the largest good subtree is `n - 1`, which directly addresses the problem requirements.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution involves a simple realization that the largest good subtree is `n - 1`, as removing any edge from a tree results in the largest possible subtree being `n - 1`. This approach is efficient and directly addresses the problem requirements.

    ```python
    def find_max_good_subtree(n, edges):
        return n - 1

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(q):
            n = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            edges = []
            for _ in range(n - 1):
                x = int(data[index])
                y = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
                edges.append((x, y))
        
            result = find_max_good_subtree(n, edges)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem requirements and leveraging the inherent properties of tree structures to find efficient solutions.

        Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
        - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
        - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
        - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
        He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
        You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We have a string `S` and we form a pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. The characters in each row are formed by repeating the string `S` in a cyclic manner. We are given another string `T` and need to answer `Q` queries. Each query provides a row number `N`, and we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Pyramid**: 
           - The `N`-th row of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string `S` until it reaches a length of `N`.
           - This means the `N`-th row is `S` repeated `N // len(S)` times plus the first `N % len(S)` characters of `S`.

        2. **Finding Substring Occurrences**:
           - For each query, construct the `N`-th row as described.
           - Count the number of times `T` appears as a substring in this row.

        3. **Efficiency Considerations**:
           - Directly constructing the `N`-th row for very large `N` is inefficient.
           - Instead, use the properties of cyclic repetition to determine the row content without explicitly constructing it.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
            results = []
            len_s = length of S
            len_t = length of T

            for each query N in queries:
                # Calculate the effective row
                full_repeats = N // len_s
                remainder = N % len_s

                # Construct the row
                row = S * full_repeats + S[:remainder]

                # Count occurrences of T in the row
                count = 0
                for i from 0 to length of row - len_t:
                    if row[i:i+len_t] == T:
                        count += 1

                results.append(count)

            return results
        ```

        ### Final Python Code

        ```python
        def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
            results = []
            len_s = len(S)
            len_t = len(T)

            for N in queries:
                # Calculate the effective row
                full_repeats = N // len_s
                remainder = N % len_s

                # Construct the row
                row = S * full_repeats + S[:remainder]

                # Count occurrences of T in the row
                count = 0
                for i in range(len(row) - len_t + 1):
                    if row[i:i+len_t] == T:
                        count += 1

                results.append(count)

            return results

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            S = data[0]
            T = data[1]
            Q = int(data[2])
            queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]

                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Row Construction**: For each query, we determine how many full repetitions of `S` fit into the row and how many additional characters are needed.
        - **Substring Search**: We then search for `T` in this constructed row.
        - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the construction of the row and the search for `T` by leveraging Python's string slicing and comparison operations.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of queries, each with an array. For each array, we need to determine how many of its subarrays are "stack exterminable." A subarray is stack exterminable if, when processed through a specific stack operation, the stack ends up empty. The stack operation is as follows: push elements onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case pop the stack.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Stack Extermination**:
   - For a subarray to be stack exterminable, every element must be paired with another identical element such that they cancel each other out when processed through the stack.
   - This means that the count of each element in the subarray must be even.

2. **Efficient Subarray Checking**:
   - Instead of checking every possible subarray, we can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find subarrays where all elements have even counts.
   - As we iterate through the array, maintain a count of elements in the current subarray. If all counts are even, the subarray is stack exterminable.

3. **Iterate Over Queries**:
   - For each query, iterate over the array using a sliding window approach to count stack exterminable subarrays.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(queries):
    results = []
    for each query in queries:
        n = length of the array
        array = the array from the query
        exterminable_count = 0
        
        # Use a dictionary to count occurrences of elements in the current subarray
        element_count = {}
        left = 0
        
        for right in range(n):
            # Add the current element to the count
            element_count[array[right]] = element_count.get(array[right], 0) + 1
            
            # Check if the current subarray is stack exterminable
            while all(count % 2 == 0 for count in element_count.values()):
                exterminable_count += 1
                # Move the left pointer to shrink the window
                element_count[array[left]] -= 1
                if element_count[array[left]] == 0:
                    del element_count[array[left]]
                left += 1
        
        results.append(exterminable_count)
    
    return results
```

### Explanation

- **Data Structure**: We use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each element in the current subarray.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: We use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the current subarray. The `right` pointer expands the subarray, and the `left` pointer contracts it when the subarray is stack exterminable.
- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently checks subarrays by maintaining a running count of elements, ensuring that we only consider subarrays where all element counts are even.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the length of array $a$.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)Â â€” the elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of queries, each with an array. For each array, we need to determine how many of its subarrays are "stack exterminable." A subarray is stack exterminable if, when processed through a specific stack operation, the stack ends up empty. The stack operation is as follows: push elements onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case pop the stack.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Stack Extermination**:
   - For a subarray to be stack exterminable, every element must be paired with another identical element such that they cancel each other out when processed through the stack.
   - This means that the count of each element in the subarray must be even.

2. **Efficient Subarray Checking**:
   - Instead of checking every possible subarray, we can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find subarrays where all elements have even counts.
   - As we iterate through the array, maintain a count of elements in the current subarray. If all counts are even, the subarray is stack exterminable.

3. **Iterate Over Queries**:
   - For each query, iterate over the array using a sliding window approach to count stack exterminable subarrays.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(queries):
    results = []
    for each query in queries:
        n = length of the array
        array = the array from the query
        exterminable_count = 0
        
        # Use a dictionary to count occurrences of elements in the current subarray
        element_count = {}
        left = 0
        
        for right in range(n):
            # Add the current element to the count
            element_count[array[right]] = element_count.get(array[right], 0) + 1
            
            # Check if the current subarray is stack exterminable
            while all(count % 2 == 0 for count in element_count.values()):
                exterminable_count += 1
                # Move the left pointer to shrink the window
                element_count[array[left]] -= 1
                if element_count[array[left]] == 0:
                    del element_count[array[left]]
                left += 1
        
        results.append(exterminable_count)
    
    return results
```

    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":

```

### Explanation

- **Data Structure**: We use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each element in the current subarray.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: We use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the current subarray. The `right` pointer expands the subarray, and the `left` pointer contracts it when the subarray is stack exterminable.
- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently checks subarrays by maintaining a running count of elements, ensuring that we only consider subarrays where all element counts are even.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the initial solution is that it incorrectly checks for stack exterminable subarrays. The condition for a subarray to be stack exterminable is not simply that all element counts are even. Instead, the subarray must be processed through the stack operation, which involves pushing and popping elements based on the stack's top element.

### Correct Approach

1. **Stack Simulation**:
   - For each subarray, simulate the stack operation: push elements onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case pop the stack.
   - If the stack is empty after processing the subarray, it is stack exterminable.

2. **Iterate Over All Subarrays**:
   - For each starting point of the subarray, iterate over all possible ending points.
   - For each subarray, simulate the stack operation and check if the stack is empty at the end.

3. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - This approach is less efficient than the previous one but correctly simulates the stack operation for each subarray.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(queries):
    results = []
    for each query in queries:
        n = length of the array
        array = the array from the query
        exterminable_count = 0
        
        for start in range(n):
            stack = []
            for end in range(start, n):
                current_element = array[end]
                if stack and stack[-1] == current_element:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(current_element)
                
                if not stack:
                    exterminable_count += 1
        
        results.append(exterminable_count)
    
    return results
```

### Final Python Code

                else:
                    stack.append(current_element)
                
                if not stack:
                    exterminable_count += 1

```

### Explanation

- **Stack Simulation**: For each subarray, simulate the stack operation by iterating over the elements and applying the push/pop logic.
- **Subarray Iteration**: Iterate over all possible subarrays using two nested loops, where the outer loop sets the starting point and the inner loop sets the ending point.
- **Correctness**: This approach ensures that each subarray is correctly processed through the stack operation, and only those that leave the stack empty are counted.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the length of array $a$.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)Â â€” the elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer in single line â€” the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.


-----Example-----
Input
3
5
2 1 1 2 2
6
1 2 1 1 3 2
9
3 1 2 2 1 6 6 3 3

Output

-----Note-----

In the first query there are four stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 4} = [2, 1, 1, 2], a_{2 \ldots 3} = [1, 1], a_{2 \ldots 5} = [1, 1, 2, 2], a_{4 \ldots 5} = [2, 2]$.

In the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarrayÂ â€” $a_{3 \ldots 4}$.

In the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 8}, a_{2 \ldots 5}, a_{2 \ldots 7}, a_{2 \ldots 9}, a_{3 \ldots 4}, a_{6 \ldots 7}, a_{6 \ldots 9}, a_{8 \ldots 9}$.

### Explanation

- **Data Structure**: We use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each element in the current subarray.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: We use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the current subarray. The `right` pointer expands the subarray, and the `left` pointer contracts it when the subarray is stack exterminable.
- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently checks subarrays by maintaining a running count of elements, ensuring that we only consider subarrays where all element counts are even.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the initial solution is that it incorrectly checks for stack exterminable subarrays. The condition for a subarray to be stack exterminable is not simply that all element counts are even. Instead, the subarray must be processed through the stack operation, which involves pushing and popping elements based on the stack's top element.

### Correct Approach

1. **Stack Simulation**:
   - For each subarray, simulate the stack operation: push elements onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case pop the stack.
   - If the stack is empty after processing the subarray, it is stack exterminable.

2. **Iterate Over All Subarrays**:
   - For each starting point of the subarray, iterate over all possible ending points.
   - For each subarray, simulate the stack operation and check if the stack is empty at the end.

3. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - This approach is less efficient than the previous one but correctly simulates the stack operation for each subarray.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(queries):
    results = []
    for each query in queries:
        n = length of the array
        array = the array from the query
        exterminable_count = 0
        
        for start in range(n):
            stack = []
            for end in range(start, n):
                current_element = array[end]
                if stack and stack[-1] == current_element:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(current_element)
                
                if not stack:
                    exterminable_count += 1
        
        results.append(exterminable_count)
    
    return results
```

### Explanation

- **Stack Simulation**: For each subarray, simulate the stack operation by iterating over the elements and applying the push/pop logic.
- **Subarray Iteration**: Iterate over all possible subarrays using two nested loops, where the outer loop sets the starting point and the inner loop sets the ending point.
- **Correctness**: This approach ensures that each subarray is correctly processed through the stack operation, and only those that leave the stack empty are counted.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break to reach the origin from a given starting point, or if the starting point lies on a wall. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant, and the solution required efficient handling of multiple test cases with potentially large input sizes.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Set for Fast Lookup**: Using a set to store wall positions allowed for O(1) time complexity when checking if a starting point lies on a wall.
    - **Counting with Conditions**: The problem required counting how many wall positions are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point. This was efficiently handled by iterating over the sorted list of wall positions.

    ### Strategies
    - **Input Parsing and Management**: Efficiently parsing input and managing indices was crucial given the constraints.
    - **Iterative Counting**: Instead of using complex data structures, a simple iteration over the sorted list of wall positions was sufficient to count the walls Chef needs to break.

    ### Code Snippet
    ```python
    a_set = set(a)  # Convert list to set for O(1) lookup
    for _ in range(Q):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
    
        sum_xy = x + y
        if sum_xy in a_set:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            count = 0
            for ai in a:
                if ai > sum_xy:
                    count += 1
            results.append(count)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of using appropriate data structures for fast lookups and the simplicity of iterative solutions when dealing with sorted data. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum of a subsequence of PokÃ©mon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.

    #### Strategies and Mistakes
    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.

    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.

    ### Code Snippet

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            n, strengths = test_case
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
            alternating_sum = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]
                else:
                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]
            results.append(alternating_sum)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
            test_cases.append((n, strengths))
    
        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)

            print(result)

    ### Summary of Attempts on the "Good Subtree" Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around understanding tree structures and identifying subtrees that can be represented by intersecting segments. The key insight is that the largest "good" subtree is the largest connected component that can be formed by removing the least number of edges. This involves recognizing that a tree with `n` nodes has `n-1` edges, and removing any edge will split the tree into two subtrees.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misinterpreted the problem by focusing on calculating subtree sizes using DFS, which led to incorrect results. The mistake was in not correctly identifying the specific requirement of forming a "good" subtree, which involves intersecting segments. The initial approach was to calculate the size of the subtree rooted at each node, but this did not align with the problem's requirements.

    The correct strategy is to realize that the largest good subtree is simply the entire tree minus one edge, which is `n - 1`. This is because removing any single edge from a tree of `n` nodes results in two subtrees, and the largest possible subtree is `n - 1`.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the output misalignment, where the expected output was not correctly matched with the calculated result. This was due to a misunderstanding of the problem requirements. The fix involved recognizing that the largest good subtree is `n - 1`, which directly addresses the problem requirements.

    #### Final Solution
    The final solution involves a simple realization that the largest good subtree is `n - 1`, as removing any edge from a tree results in the largest possible subtree being `n - 1`. This approach is efficient and directly addresses the problem requirements.

    ```python
    def find_max_good_subtree(n, edges):
        return n - 1

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(q):
            n = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            edges = []
            for _ in range(n - 1):
                x = int(data[index])
                y = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
                edges.append((x, y))
        
            result = find_max_good_subtree(n, edges)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the length of array $a$.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)Â â€” the elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer in single line â€” the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.


-----Example-----

In the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarrayÂ â€” $a_{3 \ldots 4}$.

In the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 8}, a_{2 \ldots 5}, a_{2 \ldots 7}, a_{2 \ldots 9}, a_{3 \ldots 4}, a_{6 \ldots 7}, a_{6 \ldots 9}, a_{8 \ldots 9}$.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a sequence of queries, each with an array. For each array, we need to determine how many of its subarrays are "stack exterminable." A subarray is stack exterminable if, when processed through a specific stack operation, the stack ends up empty. The stack operation is as follows: push elements onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case pop the stack.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Stack Extermination**:
   - For a subarray to be stack exterminable, every element must be paired with another identical element such that they cancel each other out when processed through the stack.
   - This means that the count of each element in the subarray must be even.

2. **Efficient Subarray Checking**:
   - Instead of checking every possible subarray, we can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find subarrays where all elements have even counts.
   - As we iterate through the array, maintain a count of elements in the current subarray. If all counts are even, the subarray is stack exterminable.

3. **Iterate Over Queries**:
   - For each query, iterate over the array using a sliding window approach to count stack exterminable subarrays.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(queries):
    results = []
    for each query in queries:
        n = length of the array
        array = the array from the query
        exterminable_count = 0
        
        # Use a dictionary to count occurrences of elements in the current subarray
        element_count = {}
        left = 0
        
        for right in range(n):
            # Add the current element to the count
            element_count[array[right]] = element_count.get(array[right], 0) + 1
            
            # Check if the current subarray is stack exterminable
            while all(count % 2 == 0 for count in element_count.values()):
                exterminable_count += 1
                # Move the left pointer to shrink the window
                element_count[array[left]] -= 1
                if element_count[array[left]] == 0:
                    del element_count[array[left]]
                left += 1
        
        results.append(exterminable_count)
    
    return results
```

        left = 0

    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":

### Explanation

- **Data Structure**: We use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each element in the current subarray.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: We use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the current subarray. The `right` pointer expands the subarray, and the `left` pointer contracts it when the subarray is stack exterminable.
- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently checks subarrays by maintaining a running count of elements, ensuring that we only consider subarrays where all element counts are even.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the initial solution is that it incorrectly checks for stack exterminable subarrays. The condition for a subarray to be stack exterminable is not simply that all element counts are even. Instead, the subarray must be processed through the stack operation, which involves pushing and popping elements based on the stack's top element.

### Correct Approach

1. **Stack Simulation**:
   - For each subarray, simulate the stack operation: push elements onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case pop the stack.
   - If the stack is empty after processing the subarray, it is stack exterminable.

2. **Iterate Over All Subarrays**:
   - For each starting point of the subarray, iterate over all possible ending points.
   - For each subarray, simulate the stack operation and check if the stack is empty at the end.

3. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - This approach is less efficient than the previous one but correctly simulates the stack operation for each subarray.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(queries):
    results = []
    for each query in queries:
        n = length of the array
        array = the array from the query
        exterminable_count = 0
        
        for start in range(n):
            stack = []
            for end in range(start, n):
                current_element = array[end]
                if stack and stack[-1] == current_element:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(current_element)
                
                if not stack:
                    exterminable_count += 1
        
        results.append(exterminable_count)
    
    return results

INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] In this problem, we needed to determine the number of stack exterminable subarrays for a given set of queries, each containing an array. The core concept was simulating a stack operation where elements are pushed onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case the stack is popped. A subarray is considered stack exterminable if the stack is empty after processing all its elements.

Initially, I attempted to solve the problem by checking if all element counts in a subarray were even, which was incorrect. The correct approach required simulating the stack operation for each subarray. This involved iterating over all possible subarrays using a nested loop and applying the stack logic to determine if the stack was empty at the end.

The key takeaway was the importance of accurately simulating the stack operation for each subarray rather than relying on a simplified condition. This experience reinforced the need to carefully translate problem requirements into code logic, especially when dealing with operations that have specific conditions like stack operations. The final solution correctly iterated over all subarrays and applied the stack operation, ensuring that only those subarrays that left the stack empty were counted.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the length of array $a$.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)Â â€” the elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.

   - For a subarray to be stack exterminable, every element must be paired with another identical element such that they cancel each other out when processed through the stack.
   - This means that the count of each element in the subarray must be even.

2. **Efficient Subarray Checking**:
   - Instead of checking every possible subarray, we can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find subarrays where all elements have even counts.
   - As we iterate through the array, maintain a count of elements in the current subarray. If all counts are even, the subarray is stack exterminable.

3. **Iterate Over Queries**:
   - For each query, iterate over the array using a sliding window approach to count stack exterminable subarrays.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(queries):
    results = []
    for each query in queries:
        n = length of the array
        array = the array from the query
        exterminable_count = 0
        
        # Use a dictionary to count occurrences of elements in the current subarray
        element_count = {}
        left = 0
        
        for right in range(n):
            # Add the current element to the count
            element_count[array[right]] = element_count.get(array[right], 0) + 1
            
            # Check if the current subarray is stack exterminable
            while all(count % 2 == 0 for count in element_count.values()):
                exterminable_count += 1
                # Move the left pointer to shrink the window
                element_count[array[left]] -= 1
                if element_count[array[left]] == 0:
                    del element_count[array[left]]
                left += 1
        
        results.append(exterminable_count)
    
    return results
```

### Final Python Code

```python
def count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(queries):
    results = []
    for n, array in queries:
        exterminable_count = 0
        element_count = {}
        left = 0
        
        for right in range(n):
            # Add the current element to the count
            element_count[array[right]] = element_count.get(array[right], 0) + 1

### Explanation

- **Data Structure**: We use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each element in the current subarray.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: We use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the current subarray. The `right` pointer expands the subarray, and the `left` pointer contracts it when the subarray is stack exterminable.
- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently checks subarrays by maintaining a running count of elements, ensuring that we only consider subarrays where all element counts are even.

INFO - [Task id] 84 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the initial solution is that it incorrectly checks for stack exterminable subarrays. The condition for a subarray to be stack exterminable is not simply that all element counts are even. Instead, the subarray must be processed through the stack operation, which involves pushing and popping elements based on the stack's top element.

### Correct Approach

1. **Stack Simulation**:
   - For each subarray, simulate the stack operation: push elements onto the stack unless the top of the stack is the same as the current element, in which case pop the stack.
   - If the stack is empty after processing the subarray, it is stack exterminable.

2. **Iterate Over All Subarrays**:
   - For each starting point of the subarray, iterate over all possible ending points.
   - For each subarray, simulate the stack operation and check if the stack is empty at the end.

3. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - This approach is less efficient than the previous one but correctly simulates the stack operation for each subarray.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function count_stack_exterminable_subarrays(queries):
    results = []
    for each query in queries:
        n = length of the array
        array = the array from the query
        exterminable_count = 0
        
        for start in range(n):
            stack = []
            for end in range(start, n):
                current_element = array[end]
                if stack and stack[-1] == current_element:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(current_element)

INFO - [Task id] 84 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the "stack exterminable subarrays" problem, I gained several insights:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Initially, I misunderstood the condition for a subarray to be stack exterminable. The key is not just having even counts of elements but ensuring that the stack operation results in an empty stack. This requires simulating the stack process for each subarray.

2. **Brute Force vs. Efficient Solutions**: My initial approach was a brute force method that correctly simulated the stack operation for each subarray. While this approach was correct, it was not efficient for large inputs due to its O(n^2) complexity.

3. **Official Solution Insight**: The official solution uses a trie-like structure to efficiently track the state of the stack. This approach is more efficient because it avoids redundant calculations by storing and reusing the results of previous stack states. The use of a trie allows for a more compact representation of possible stack states, reducing the time complexity significantly.

4. **Data Structures**: The official solution's use of a trie to represent stack states is a clever use of data structures to optimize the problem. This highlights the importance of choosing the right data structure to improve both time and space efficiency.

5. **Mathematical Insight**: The official solution also uses combinatorial mathematics to efficiently count stack exterminable subarrays by calculating the number of valid transitions in the trie. This reduces the need to explicitly simulate each subarray, leveraging mathematical properties to achieve the same result.

In summary, this problem reinforced the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and considering efficient data structures and mathematical techniques to optimize solutions. The official solution's use of a trie and combinatorial counting is a powerful technique that can be applied to similar problems involving state transitions and counting.

[Problem]
    Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

    If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

    There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

    Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

    You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

    Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.


    -----Input-----

    The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the number of queries.

    The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)Â â€” the length of array $a$.

    The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)Â â€” the elements.

    It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case print one integer in single line â€” the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.


    -----Example-----
    Input
    3
    5
    2 1 1 2 2
    6
    1 2 1 1 3 2
    9
    3 1 2 2 1 6 6 3 3

    Output
    4
    1
    8



    -----Note-----

    In the first query there are four stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 4} = [2, 1, 1, 2], a_{2 \ldots 3} = [1, 1], a_{2 \ldots 5} = [1, 1, 2, 2], a_{4 \ldots 5} = [2, 2]$.

    In the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarrayÂ â€” $a_{3 \ldots 4}$.

    In the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 8}, a_{2 \ldots 5}, a_{2 \ldots 7}, a_{2 \ldots 9}, a_{3 \ldots 4}, a_{6 \ldots 7}, a_{6 \ldots 9}, a_{8 \ldots 9}$.
