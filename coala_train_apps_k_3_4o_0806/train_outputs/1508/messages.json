Each line `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `K-1`) contains `K` digits. The digits in each line are determined by the following rules:\n- If the line number `i` is even, the digits are in increasing order starting from `0` up to `K-1`.\n- If the line number `i` is odd, the digits are in decreasing order starting from `K-1` down to `0`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Read the number of test cases `T`.\n2. For each test case, read the integer `K`.\n3. For each test case, generate `K` lines:\n   - For even-indexed lines, generate a sequence of numbers from `0` to `K-1`.\n   - For odd-indexed lines, generate a sequence of numbers from `K-1` to `0`.\n4.

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).\n        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.\n        Note f([1]) = 0.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.\n        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - 1 \u2264 T \u2264 40\n        - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file \u2264 106\n        - 0 \u2264 K \u2264 2 * 1010\n\n        -----Example-----\n        Input:\n        3\n        4 12\n        2 2\n        5 14\n\n        Output:\n        -1\n        1 2\n        5 4 3 2 1\n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.\n        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. \n        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n        ### Problem Restatement\n        We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and need to find a permutation such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n        1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:\n           \\[\n           f(P) = \\max(p_1, p_2) + \\max(p_2, p_3) + \\ldots + \\max(p_{N-1}, p_N)\n           \\]\n\n        2. **Constraints and Observations**:\n           - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.\n           - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \\(\\frac{N \\times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\\).\n\n        3. **Approach**:\n           - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.\n           - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.\n\n        4. **Constructing the Permutation**:\n           - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.\n           - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n        ```\n        function find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n            for each (N, K) in test_cases:\n                if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:\n                    output -1\n                else:\n                    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]\n                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1\n                    i = 0\n                    while current_sum > K:\n                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i+1]:\n                            swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]\n                            current_sum -= 1\n                        i += 1\n                    output permutation\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                if K < N - 1 or K > (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n                    i = 0\n                    while current_sum > K:\n                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                            current_sum -= 1\n                        i += 1\n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n        - We start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum.\n        - We then iteratively swap adjacent elements to reduce the sum until it matches K.\n        - This approach ensures that we efficiently find a permutation that satisfies the condition or determine that it's impossible.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['3', '4 12', '2 2', '5 14'] Expected output: [{'-1'}, {'1', '2'}, {'5', '1', '3', '4', '2'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.

There are n appetizers numbered from 0 to n-1 such that if the appetizers are arrayed in this order, they will display the message. The Chef plans to display them in this order on a table that can be viewed by all guests as they enter. The appetizers will only be served once all guests are seated.\n\n        The appetizers are not necessarily finished in the same order as they are numbered. So, when an appetizer is finished the Chef will write the number on a piece of paper and place it beside the appetizer on a counter between the kitchen and the restaurant. A server will retrieve this appetizer and place it in the proper location according to the number written beside it.\n\n        The Chef has a penchant for binary numbers. The number of appetizers created is a power of 2, say n = 2k. Furthermore, he has written the number of the appetizer in binary with exactly k bits. That is, binary numbers with fewer than k bits are padded on the left with zeros so they are written with exactly k bits.\n\n        Unfortunately, this has unforseen complications. A binary number still \"looks\" binary when it is written upside down. For example, the binary number \"0101\" looks like \"1010\" when read upside down and the binary number \"110\" looks like \"011\" (the Chef uses simple vertical lines to denote a 1 bit). The Chef didn't realize that the servers would read the numbers upside down so he doesn't rotate the paper when he places it on the counter. Thus, when the server picks up an appetizer they place it the location indexed by the binary number when it is read upside down.\n\n        You are given the message the chef intended to display and you are to display the message that will be displayed after the servers move all appetizers to their locations based on the binary numbers they read.\n\n        -----Input-----\n\n        The first line consists of a single integer T \u2264 25 indicating the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of a single line beginning with an integer 1 \u2264 k \u2264 16 followed by a string of precisely 2k characters. The integer and the string are separated by a single space. The string has no spaces and is composed only of lower case letters from `a` to `z`.\n\n\n        -----Output-----\n\n        For each test case you are to output the scrambled message on a single line.\n\n\n        -----Example-----\n        Input:\n        2\n        2 chef\n        4 enjoyourapplepie\n\n        Output:\n        cehf\n        eayejpuinpopolre\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        ### Analysis of the Problem\n\n        The issue seems to be related to how the input and output are handled. The function `solve_scrambled_message()` is defined but not called, which means the code that processes the input and generates the output is never executed. This is a common mistake when defining functions for tasks that require immediate execution.\n\n        ### Steps to Correct the Code\n\n        1. **Ensure Function Execution**: The function `solve_scrambled_message()` should be called at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.\n\n        2. **Check Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly from standard input.

        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem requires generating a specific pattern based on an integer \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. For each test case, given an integer \\( K \\), we need to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern consists of \\( K \\) lines, where each line \\( i \\) (0-indexed) contains numbers starting from \\( i \\) down to 0, followed by numbers from 0 up to \\( i \\).\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern**: \n   - For each test case with integer \\( K \\), we need to generate \\( K \\) lines.\n   - Each line \\( i \\) should start with numbers from \\( i \\) down to 0, and then continue with numbers from 0 up to \\( i \\).\n\n2. **Pattern Construction**:\n   - For line \\( i \\):\n     - First, print numbers from \\( i \\) down to 0.\n     - Then, print numbers from 0 up to \\( i \\).\n\n3. **Iterate for Each Test Case**:\n   - Read the number of test cases \\( T \\).\n   - For each test case, read \\( K \\) and generate the pattern as described.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n    for each K in test_cases:\n        for i from 0 to K-1:\n            # Generate the line pattern\n            line = []\n            # Add numbers from i down to 0\n            for j from i down to 0:\n                line.append(j)\n            # Add numbers from 1 up to i\n            for j from 1 to i:\n                line.append(j)\n            # Print the line as a string\n            print(\"\".join(map(str, line)))\n```\n\n### Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n    for K in test_cases:\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = []\n            # Add numbers from i down to 0\n            for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                line.append(j)\n            # Add numbers from 1 up to i\n            for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                line.append(j)\n            # Print the line as a string\n            print(\"\".join(map(str, line)))\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the number of test cases \\( T \\) is extracted. Each test case value \\( K \\) is stored in a list `test_cases`.\n- **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, iterate from 0 to \\( K-1 \\) to generate each line of the pattern. For each line \\( i \\), first append numbers from \\( i \\) down to 0, then append numbers from 1 up to \\( i \\).\n- **Output**: Each line is printed immediately after it is constructed. The `map` function is used to convert numbers to strings for joining and printing."

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to iteratively remove the substring \"abc\" from a given string until no such substring remains, and to do this for multiple test cases. The core concept here was to use a loop to repeatedly search and remove the substring \"abc\" from the string.\n\n    Initially, the function was defined correctly but was not called, which led to no output being produced. This highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed by explicitly calling them, especially in a script that relies on standard input and output.\n\n    The solution involved reading all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is suitable for competitive programming environments. The `replace` method was used to remove the first occurrence of \"abc\" in each iteration, and the process was repeated until the string was stable (i.e., no more \"abc\" substrings were found).\n\n    The key takeaway from this exercise is the importance of function calls in script execution and the effective use of string manipulation methods to solve iterative removal problems. This approach can be applied to similar problems where a specific pattern needs to be removed from a string repeatedly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this permutation problem, there are several key insights and lessons learned:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem required constructing a permutation such that the sum of the maximums of consecutive pairs equals a given integer K. The constraints on the minimum and maximum possible values of this sum were crucial in determining if a solution was possible.\n\n    2. **Initial Approach and Mistakes**: My initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation to achieve the maximum possible sum and then adjusting it to reach K. However, the logic for adjusting the permutation was not robust enough to handle all cases, particularly when the sum needed to be reduced by more than one at a time.\n\n    3. **Importance of Function Execution**: A critical oversight was not calling the function that contained the main logic, which resulted in no output. This highlights the importance of ensuring that all parts of the code are executed as intended.\n\n    4. **Official Solution Insights**: The official solution provided a more structured approach to handling even and odd values of N separately. It efficiently calculates the possible range for K and constructs the permutation by strategically placing elements to achieve the desired sum. This approach is more systematic and handles edge cases more effectively.\n\n    5. **Key Takeaways**:\n       - Always verify that the function containing the main logic is called.\n       - Consider edge cases and ensure the logic can handle adjustments to the permutation sum efficiently.\n       - Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts (like handling even and odd N separately) can simplify the solution.\n\n    These insights will be valuable for tackling similar permutation and combinatorial problems in the future.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this permutation problem, there are several key insights and lessons learned:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem required constructing a permutation such that the sum of the maximums of consecutive pairs equals a given integer K. The constraints on the minimum and maximum possible values of this sum were crucial in determining if a solution was possible.\n\n    2. **Initial Approach and Mistakes**: My initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation to achieve the maximum possible sum and then adjusting it to reach K. However, the logic for adjusting the permutation was not robust enough to handle all cases, particularly when the sum needed to be reduced by more than one at a time.\n\n    3. **Importance of Function Execution**: A critical oversight was not calling the function that contained the main logic, which resulted in no output. This highlights the importance of ensuring that all parts of the code are executed as intended.\n\n    4. **Official Solution Insights**: The official solution provided a more structured approach to handling even and odd values of N separately. It efficiently calculates the possible range for K and constructs the permutation by strategically placing elements to achieve the desired sum. This approach is more systematic and handles edge cases more effectively.\n\n    5. **Key Takeaways**:\n       - Always verify that the function containing the main logic is called.\n       - Consider edge cases and ensure the logic can handle adjustments to the permutation sum efficiently.\n       - Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts (like handling even and odd N separately) can simplify the solution.\n\n    These insights will be valuable for tackling similar permutation and combinatorial problems in the future.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).\n        You are given N and an integer K.

The function `find_permutation` is defined but not called, which means the code doesn't execute.\n\n        2. **Logic for Permutation Construction**:\n           - The logic attempts to start with the maximum possible sum by using a descending order permutation.\n           - It then tries to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K by swapping adjacent elements.\n\n        3. **Mistakes and Misunderstandings**:\n           - The function `find_permutation` is defined but never called, so no logic is executed.\n           - The permutation adjustment logic might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the sum needs to be reduced by more than one at a time.\n           - The permutation construction logic might not correctly handle cases where the desired sum K is exactly the maximum possible sum.\n\n        ### Steps to Correct the Solution\n        1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: Make sure the function is executed by calling it after its definition.\n        2. **Refine the Permutation Adjustment Logic**:\n           - Ensure that the logic correctly reduces the sum to K by considering larger swaps or more efficient adjustments.\n           - Handle edge cases where the desired sum is exactly the maximum possible sum.\n\n        3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test the solution with various edge cases to ensure correctness.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n        Let's revise the solution to address these issues:\n\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)\n                min_possible = N - 1\n                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n        \n                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    # Start with the permutation in descending order\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_sum = max_possible\n            \n                    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K\n                    for i in range(N - 1):\n                        if current_sum == K:\n                            break\n                        # Calculate the current max of the pair\n                        current_max = max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1])\n                        # Calculate the new max if we swap\n                        new_max = max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i + 2] if i + 2 < N else 0)\n                        # Calculate the difference\n                        diff = current_max - new_max\n                        # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap\n                        if current_sum - diff >= K:\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                            current_sum -= diff\n            \n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute\n        find_permutation()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Changes\n        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure execution.\n        - **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.\n        - **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called and the logic is correctly implemented to handle the permutation construction and adjustment.

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this permutation problem, there are several key insights and lessons learned:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem required constructing a permutation such that the sum of the maximums of consecutive pairs equals a given integer K. The constraints on the minimum and maximum possible values of this sum were crucial in determining if a solution was possible.\n\n    2. **Initial Approach and Mistakes**: My initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation to achieve the maximum possible sum and then adjusting it to reach K. However, the logic for adjusting the permutation was not robust enough to handle all cases, particularly when the sum needed to be reduced by more than one at a time.\n\n    3. **Importance of Function Execution**: A critical oversight was not calling the function that contained the main logic, which resulted in no output. This highlights the importance of ensuring that all parts of the code are executed as intended.\n\n    4. **Official Solution Insights**: The official solution provided a more structured approach to handling even and odd values of N separately. It efficiently calculates the possible range for K and constructs the permutation by strategically placing elements to achieve the desired sum. This approach is more systematic and handles edge cases more effectively.\n\n    5. **Key Takeaways**:\n       - Always verify that the function containing the main logic is called.\n       - Consider edge cases and ensure the logic can handle adjustments to the permutation sum efficiently.\n       - Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts (like handling even and odd N separately) can simplify the solution.\n\n    These insights will be valuable for tackling similar permutation and combinatorial problems in the future.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).\n        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.\n        Note f([1]) = 0.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.\n        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - 1 \u2264 T \u2264 40\n        - 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file \u2264 106\n        - 0 \u2264 K \u2264 2 * 1010\n\n        -----Example-----\n        Input:\n        3\n        4 12\n        2 2\n        5 14\n\n        Output:\n        -1\n        1 2\n        5 4 3 2 1\n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.\n        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. \n        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:\n\n        ### Analysis of the Current Solution\n        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input and `sys.stdout.write` to output results. This is appropriate for competitive programming but can be tricky if not handled correctly. The function `find_permutation` is defined but not called, which means the code doesn't execute.\n\n        2. **Logic for Permutation Construction**:\n           - The logic attempts to start with the maximum possible sum by using a descending order permutation.\n           - It then tries to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K by swapping adjacent elements.\n\n        3. **Mistakes and Misunderstandings**:\n           - The function `find_permutation` is defined but never called, so no logic is executed.\n           - The permutation adjustment logic might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the sum needs to be reduced by more than one at a time.\n           - The permutation construction logic might not correctly handle cases where the desired sum K is exactly the maximum possible sum.\n\n        ### Steps to Correct the Solution\n        1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: Make sure the function is executed by calling it after its definition.\n        2. **Refine the Permutation Adjustment Logic**:\n           - Ensure that the logic correctly reduces the sum to K by considering larger swaps or more efficient adjustments.\n           - Handle edge cases where the desired sum is exactly the maximum possible sum.\n\n        3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test the solution with various edge cases to ensure correctness.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n        Let's revise the solution to address these issues:\n\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)\n                min_possible = N - 1\n                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n        \n                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    # Start with the permutation in descending order\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_sum = max_possible\n            \n                    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K\n                    for i in range(N - 1):\n                        if current_sum == K:\n                            break\n                        # Calculate the current max of the pair\n                        current_max = max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1])\n                        # Calculate the new max if we swap\n                        new_max = max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i + 2] if i + 2 < N else 0)\n                        # Calculate the difference\n                        diff = current_max - new_max\n                        # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap\n                        if current_sum - diff >= K:\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                            current_sum -= diff\n            \n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute\n        find_permutation()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Changes\n        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure execution.\n        - **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.\n        - **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called and the logic is correctly implemented to handle the permutation construction and adjustment.

This list represents the first line of the pattern.\n\n2. **Iterative Line Construction**: For each subsequent line, the solution modifies the list `s` by removing the last element and prepending the next number in sequence.

Specifically, the logic for constructing each line was incorrect, leading to concatenated and incorrect outputs. The official solution's approach of using a list to manage the sequence of numbers and iteratively adjusting it for each line is a more robust and straightforward method.\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThe key takeaway from the official solution is the importance of understanding the pattern's structure and using data structures (like lists) effectively to manage and manipulate sequences.
