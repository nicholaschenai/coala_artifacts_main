    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem requires generating a specific pattern based on an integer \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. For each test case, given an integer \\( K \\), we need to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern consists of \\( K \\) lines, where each line \\( i \\) (0-indexed) contains numbers starting from \\( i \\) down to 0, followed by numbers from 0 up to \\( i \\).\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern**: \n   - For each test case with integer \\( K \\), we need to generate \\( K \\) lines.\n   - Each line \\( i \\) should start with numbers from \\( i \\) down to 0, and then continue with numbers from 0 up to \\( i \\).\n\n2. **Pattern Construction**:\n   - For line \\( i \\):\n     - First, print numbers from \\( i \\) down to 0.\n     - Then, print numbers from 0 up to \\( i \\).\n\n3. **Iterate for Each Test Case**:\n   - Read the number of test cases \\( T \\).\n   - For each test case, read \\( K \\) and generate the pattern as described.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n    for each K in test_cases:\n        for i from 0 to K-1:\n            # Generate the line pattern\n            line = []\n            # Add numbers from i down to 0\n            for j from i down to 0:\n                line.append(j)\n            # Add numbers from 1 up to i\n            for j from 1 to i:\n                line.append(j)\n            # Print the line as a string\n            print(\"\".join(map(str, line)))\n```\n\n### Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n    for K in test_cases:\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = []\n            # Add numbers from i down to 0\n            for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                line.append(j)\n            # Add numbers from 1 up to i\n            for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                line.append(j)\n            # Print the line as a string\n            print(\"\".join(map(str, line)))\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the number of test cases \\( T \\) is extracted. Each test case value \\( K \\) is stored in a list `test_cases`.\n- **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, iterate from 0 to \\( K-1 \\) to generate each line of the pattern. For each line \\( i \\), first append numbers from \\( i \\) down to 0, then append numbers from 1 up to \\( i \\).\n- **Output**: Each line is printed immediately after it is constructed. The `map` function is used to convert numbers to strings for joining and printing.",
