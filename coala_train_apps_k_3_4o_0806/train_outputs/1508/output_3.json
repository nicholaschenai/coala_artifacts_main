    "raw_msg": "Let's correct the solution by ensuring the pattern is generated correctly for each test case. The pattern should be constructed such that for each line \\( i \\) (0-indexed), the numbers start from \\( i \\) down to 0, and then from 0 up to \\( i \\).\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n    for K in test_cases:\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = []\n            # Add numbers from i down to 0\n            for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                line.append(j)\n            # Add numbers from 1 up to i\n            for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                line.append(j)\n            # Print the line as a string\n            print(\"\".join(map(str, line)))\n\n# Call the function to execute the pattern generation\ngenerate_pattern()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Correction\n\n- **Line Construction**: The logic for constructing each line is corrected to ensure it follows the pattern: numbers from \\( i \\) down to 0, followed by numbers from 1 up to \\( i \\).\n- **Output**: Each line is printed immediately after it is constructed, ensuring that lines are not concatenated together. This should match the expected output format.",
