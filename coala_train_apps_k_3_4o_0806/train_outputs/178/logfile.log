INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) within this list. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements. The task is to determine the length of the longest subsequence where each element is greater than the previous one.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We initialize each element of `dp` to 1 because the minimum length of an increasing subsequence that includes any single element is 1 (the element itself).

For each element in the list, we check all previous elements to see if they are smaller. If they are, we update the `dp` value for the current element to be the maximum of its current value and the `dp` value of the previous element plus one. This way, we build up the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each element.

Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the entire list will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function lengthOfLIS(nums):
    if nums is empty:
        return 0
    
    n = length of nums
    dp = array of size n initialized to 1
    
    for i from 1 to n-1:
        for j from 0 to i-1:
            if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    return max value in dp
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # If the input list is empty, the length of LIS is 0
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        # Initialize the dp array where each element is 1
        # because the smallest LIS ending at each element is the element itself
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [1] * n
        
        # Iterate over each element in the list
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Check all previous elements to find the longest increasing subsequence
            for j in range(i):
                # If the current element is greater than a previous element
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    # Update the dp value for the current element
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
        # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in dp
        return max(dp)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which meets the problem's requirement.

    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a sequence of books using the concept of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The key insight was that the books already in the correct order form the LIS, and the rest need to be moved. Thus, the minimum moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: This problem leverages the LIS to identify the maximum subset of books that are already in the correct order. The length of the LIS helps determine how many books are already sorted.
    - **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the position to insert each book in the LIS, a binary search is used. This ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not called, which led to no output. Ensuring the function is executed by calling it at the end of the script fixed this issue.
    - **Efficient LIS Calculation**: Using a binary search to maintain the LIS allowed the solution to handle the upper constraint of 200,000 books efficiently.

    ### Code Snippet
    Here's the core logic for calculating the minimum moves using the LIS:

    ```python
    def min_moves_to_sort_books():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        N = int(data[0])
        books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
        def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
            low, high = 0, len(lis)
            while low < high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if lis[mid] < book:
                    low = mid + 1
                else:
                    high = mid
            return low
    
        lis = []
        for book in books:
            pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
            if pos == len(lis):
                lis.append(book)
            else:
                lis[pos] = book
    
        min_moves = N - len(lis)
        print(min_moves)

    min_moves_to_sort_books()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly handling input/output in competitive programming and the utility of the LIS in solving sorting-related problems efficiently.

    ### Reflection

    The problem of sorting books with the minimum number of moves can be effectively solved by identifying the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement. The official solution and my approach both leverage this concept, but they differ in implementation details.

    #### Key Insights from the Official Solution

    1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach to find the LIS. It maintains an array `l` where `l[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. This is a classic approach to solving the LIS problem with a time complexity of \(O(N^2)\).

    2. **Early Exit for Sorted Array**: The official solution includes a quick check to see if the array is already sorted, which allows for an immediate return of `0` moves. This is a simple yet effective optimization.

    3. **Comparison with My Approach**: My approach used a binary search method to maintain the LIS, which is more efficient with a time complexity of \(O(N \log N)\). This is achieved by using a helper function to find the correct position to insert each book in the LIS. This method is more suitable for larger inputs due to its better time complexity.

    #### Lessons Learned

    - **Efficiency Considerations**: While both solutions are correct, the choice of algorithm can significantly impact performance, especially for large inputs. The binary search approach is more efficient for larger datasets, which is crucial given the problem's constraints.

    - **Input Handling**: Ensuring that the function is called and input/output is handled correctly is essential in competitive programming environments. This was a key issue in my initial solution attempt.

    - **Problem-Solving Strategy**: Understanding the problem's core requirement (finding the LIS) and translating it into an efficient algorithm is critical. Both solutions effectively use the LIS concept, but the implementation details can vary based on performance needs.

    Overall, this exercise reinforced the importance of choosing the right algorithm for the problem at hand and ensuring that the solution is correctly integrated with the input/output handling expected in a competitive programming context.

INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest subsequence where each number is greater than the previous one. The subsequence does not need to be contiguous, and we are only interested in the length of this subsequence.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We'll maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We initialize each `d[i]` to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element, we check all previous elements to see if they can be part of an increasing subsequence ending at the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the `d` array.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function lengthOfLIS(nums):
       if nums is empty:

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest subsequence where each number is greater than the previous one. The subsequence does not need to be contiguous, and we are only interested in the length of this subsequence.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We'll maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We initialize each `d[i]` to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element, we check all previous elements to see if they can be part of an increasing subsequence ending at the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the `d` array.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function lengthOfLIS(nums):
       if nums is empty:
           return 0
       
       n = length of nums

   We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We'll maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`.

INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element.

This approach efficiently computes the LIS length in O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable given the problem constraints. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        n = len(nums)
        d = [1] * n
        
        for i in range(1, n):

                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
        return max(d)
```

This problem reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving subsequence problems and provided a clear example of how to implement it effectively.

INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] The official solution provides an insightful approach to solving the problem with improved time complexity, achieving O(n log n) instead of the O(n^2) complexity of my initial solution. This is accomplished by using a combination of a dynamic list `res` and a binary search function.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Dynamic List (`res`):**
   - The list `res` is used to maintain the smallest possible tail values for increasing subsequences of different lengths. This list is not the actual subsequence but helps in determining the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - A custom binary search function is used to efficiently find the position in `res` where the current number should be placed. This ensures that `res` remains sorted and helps in maintaining the smallest possible tail values.

3. **Efficient Update:**
   - For each number in the input list, if it is greater than the last element in `res`, it is appended to `res`. Otherwise, the binary search is used to find the correct position to replace an element in `res` with the current number, ensuring that `res` remains optimal for future elements.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - The use of binary search reduces the time complexity of finding the position to O(log n), and since this is done for each element, the overall complexity is O(n log n).

### Reflection:

The official solution is a great example of how leveraging data structures like lists and algorithms like binary search can significantly optimize a problem. It highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and exploring efficient algorithms to improve performance. This approach is particularly useful for problems involving subsequences or subarrays where maintaining order is crucial. In future problems, considering such optimizations can lead to more efficient solutions.

INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] The function calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given list of integers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns 0 if so. It initializes a dynamic programming array with 1s, representing the minimum subsequence length for each element. The function then iterates through the list, updating the dynamic programming array by comparing each element with all previous elements to find potential increasing subsequences. For each element, it updates the array to reflect the longest subsequence ending at that position. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the dynamic programming array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

You are a helpful assistant that extracts important information from problems and solutions to aid in searchability and education.

## Instructions
- Read through the problem and solution carefully.
- Reason out, step by step, in what scenarios this knowledge would be useful.
- Focus on general patterns and situations to help connect this knowledge to new situations.
- Then, include a list of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair.

## Response format
Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

[Problem]
    Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

    Example:


    Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
    Output: 4 
    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 

    Note: 


           There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
           Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.


    Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
