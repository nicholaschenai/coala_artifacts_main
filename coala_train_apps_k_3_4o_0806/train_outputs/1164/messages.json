We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on the number of subtasks where the number of contestants solving it decreases as the score increases. The difficulty of a problem is represented as a pair of integers, where the first integer is the count of such subtasks and the second is the problem's index. We need to sort the problems by difficulty, first by the count of decreasing subtasks and then by the problem index if counts are equal.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. For each problem, pair the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.\n2. Sort these pairs by score to ensure the subtasks are in increasing order of score.\n3. Count the number of times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.\n4. Store the difficulty as a tuple of this count and the problem index.\n5.

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints. The problem required understanding how to efficiently calculate the number of contests based on the total number of problems available and the constraints of days and problems per contest.\n\n    The key steps involved:\n    1. **Summing Problems**: Calculate the total number of problems available from all setters.\n    2. **Calculating Contests**: Determine how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`).\n    3. **Limiting by Days**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days (`D`), so the final result is the minimum of the possible contests and the available days.\n\n    The solution was straightforward once the constraints were clearly understood. The main challenge was ensuring that the logic correctly handled the constraints and efficiently processed multiple test cases. The use of integer division and the `min` function were crucial in determining the correct number of contests.\n\n    The problem reinforced the importance of breaking down constraints and using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems efficiently. The solution was implemented in Python, leveraging built-in functions for input handling and arithmetic operations. This approach can be applied to similar problems where resources are limited by multiple constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is straightforward given the problem constraints. The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted, given the number of problems available and the number of days.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n\n    1. **Problem Breakdown**: Both solutions correctly identify that the total number of problems needs to be divided by `K` to determine how many full contests can be formed. This is a simple division operation.\n\n    2. **Limiting Factor**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the final result is the minimum of the number of full contests possible and `D`.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is concise and efficient, using list comprehensions and direct input handling. It avoids unnecessary complexity and directly computes the required values.\n\n    ### Reflection:\n\n    - **Simplicity and Clarity**: The official solution is a good reminder of the power of simplicity. It uses minimal lines of code to achieve the desired result, which is both efficient and easy to understand.\n\n    - **Input Handling**: The official solution uses `eval(input())` for reading input, which is a quick way to handle multiple test cases. However, in practice, using `sys.stdin.read` can be more efficient for large inputs, as it reads all input at once.\n\n    - **Direct Calculation**: The use of `sum(A)//K` directly in the print statement is a neat way to avoid extra variables, making the code more concise.\n\n    Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of understanding the constraints and using them to simplify the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.\n    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.\n    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct fixed this issue.\n    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.\n    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n        scores = [10] * N\n        for i, j, k in questions:\n            for student in range(i, j + 1):\n                scores[student] *= k\n        total_score = sum(scores)\n        mean_score = total_score // N\n        return mean_score\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            M = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            questions = []\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i = int(data[index]) - 1\n                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n                k = int(data[index + 2])\n                index += 3\n                questions.append((i, j, k))\n            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n            results.append(result)\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

However, reflecting on the official solution, there are a few insights and differences worth noting:\n\n1. **Data Structure Choice:**\n   - The official solution uses a dictionary (`nsc`) to map scores to the number of solvers, which is a clear and direct way to handle the association between scores and solvers. This approach is slightly more intuitive than using a list of tuples, as it directly maps scores to their corresponding solver counts.\n\n2. **Sorting and Counting:**\n   - Both solutions sort the scores and count the number of times the solver count decreases. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to iterate over pairs of consecutive scores, which is a clean and concise way to handle this logic.\n\n3. **Handling Ties in Difficulty:**\n   - The official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) to group problems by their difficulty score, which allows for easy sorting of problems with the same difficulty. This approach is efficient and neatly handles the requirement to sort by problem index when difficulties are tied.\n\n4. **Output Construction:**\n   - The official solution constructs the final output list by first sorting the difficulty scores and then sorting the problem indices within each difficulty group.

It iterates over each problem, pairs scores with solvers, and sorts these pairs by score. It then counts the number of times the solver count decreases as the score increases, using this count as a measure of difficulty. Each problem's difficulty is stored as a tuple containing this count and the problem's index. The function sorts these tuples first by the difficulty count and then by the problem index.

Specifically, it applies to situations where you have a set of tasks or problems, each with multiple components or subtasks, and you need to determine the difficulty based on the performance or results of these components. This could be applicable in competitive programming contests, educational assessments, or any system where tasks are broken down into subtasks with varying levels of completion or success. The method of sorting based on a pair of values, where the primary value is a count of a specific condition (e.g., decreasing performance) and the secondary value is an identifier, is a common pattern in ranking problems."
