## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on the number of subtasks where the number of contestants solving it decreases as the score increases. The difficulty of a problem is represented as a pair of integers, where the first integer is the count of such subtasks and the second is the problem's index. We need to sort the problems by difficulty, first by the count of decreasing subtasks and then by the problem index if counts are equal.

## Conceptual Solution

1. For each problem, pair the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
2. Sort these pairs by score to ensure the subtasks are in increasing order of score.
3. Count the number of times the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.
4. Store the difficulty as a tuple of this count and the problem index.
5. Sort all problems by their difficulty tuples.
6. Output the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    for i from 0 to P-1:
        scores = problems[2*i]
        contestants = problems[2*i + 1]
        subtask_pairs = zip(scores, contestants)
        sorted_subtasks = sort(subtask_pairs by score)
        count_decreasing = 0
        for j from 0 to S-2:
            if sorted_subtasks[j][1] > sorted_subtasks[j+1][1]:
                count_decreasing += 1
        difficulties.append((count_decreasing, i+1))
    sort difficulties by (count_decreasing, index)
    return indices from sorted difficulties

read P, S
read problems as list of lists
result = calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems)
for each index in result:
    print index
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    
    for i in range(P):
        scores = problems[2 * i]
        contestants = problems[2 * i + 1]
        
        # Pair scores with contestants and sort by score
        subtask_pairs = list(zip(scores, contestants))
        subtask_pairs.sort()  # Sort by score automatically
        
        # Count the number of decreasing contestant numbers
        count_decreasing = 0
        for j in range(S - 1):
            if subtask_pairs[j][1] > subtask_pairs[j + 1][1]:
                count_decreasing += 1
        
        # Store the difficulty as a tuple (count_decreasing, problem_index)
        difficulties.append((count_decreasing, i + 1))
    
    # Sort difficulties by (count_decreasing, problem_index)
    difficulties.sort()
    
    # Extract and return the sorted problem indices
    return [index for _, index in difficulties]

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

P = int(data[0])
S = int(data[1])

problems = []
index = 2
for _ in range(2 * P):
    problems.append(list(map(int, data[index:index + S])))
    index += S

# Calculate and print the result
result = calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems)
for index in result:
    print(index)
```

This solution reads input, processes each problem to determine its difficulty, sorts the problems by difficulty, and outputs the indices in the required order.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints. The problem required understanding how to efficiently calculate the number of contests based on the total number of problems available and the constraints of days and problems per contest.

    The key steps involved:
    1. **Summing Problems**: Calculate the total number of problems available from all setters.
    2. **Calculating Contests**: Determine how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`).
    3. **Limiting by Days**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days (`D`), so the final result is the minimum of the possible contests and the available days.

    The solution was straightforward once the constraints were clearly understood. The main challenge was ensuring that the logic correctly handled the constraints and efficiently processed multiple test cases. The use of integer division and the `min` function were crucial in determining the correct number of contests.

    The problem reinforced the importance of breaking down constraints and using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems efficiently. The solution was implemented in Python, leveraging built-in functions for input handling and arithmetic operations. This approach can be applied to similar problems where resources are limited by multiple constraints.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    In this problem, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is straightforward given the problem constraints. The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted, given the number of problems available and the number of days.

    ### Key Insights:

    1. **Problem Breakdown**: Both solutions correctly identify that the total number of problems needs to be divided by `K` to determine how many full contests can be formed. This is a simple division operation.

    2. **Limiting Factor**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the final result is the minimum of the number of full contests possible and `D`.

    3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is concise and efficient, using list comprehensions and direct input handling. It avoids unnecessary complexity and directly computes the required values.

    ### Reflection:

    - **Simplicity and Clarity**: The official solution is a good reminder of the power of simplicity. It uses minimal lines of code to achieve the desired result, which is both efficient and easy to understand.

    - **Input Handling**: The official solution uses `eval(input())` for reading input, which is a quick way to handle multiple test cases. However, in practice, using `sys.stdin.read` can be more efficient for large inputs, as it reads all input at once.

    - **Direct Calculation**: The use of `sum(A)//K` directly in the print statement is a neat way to avoid extra variables, making the code more concise.

    Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of understanding the constraints and using them to simplify the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.
[/Reflection]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We then sort the problems by difficulty and output their indices in increasing order of difficulty.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - For each problem, pair the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
   - Sort these pairs by score.
   - Count how many times the number of contestants decreases as the score increases.
   - Use this count as the difficulty measure for the problem.
   - Sort all problems by their difficulty measure, and if two problems have the same difficulty, sort by their index.
   - Output the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read P and S
   Initialize a list to store difficulties

   For each problem i from 1 to P:
       Read scores and number of solvers
       Pair scores with solvers
       Sort pairs by score
       Initialize count n to 0
       For each k from 0 to S-2:
           If solvers[k] > solvers[k+1]:
               Increment n
       Append (n, i) to difficulties

   Sort difficulties by n, then by i
   For each difficulty in sorted difficulties:

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We then sort the problems by difficulty and output their indices in increasing order of difficulty.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - For each problem, pair the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
   - Sort these pairs by score.
   - Count how many times the number of contestants decreases as the score increases.
   - Use this count as the difficulty measure for the problem.
   - Sort all problems by their difficulty measure, and if two problems have the same difficulty, sort by their index.
   - Output the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Read P and S
   Initialize a list to store difficulties

   For each problem i from 1 to P:
       Read scores and number of solvers
       Pair scores with solvers

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to determine the difficulty of problems based on the number of times the number of solvers decreases as the score increases for subtasks. The key steps involved sorting subtasks by score and counting the decreases in solvers, which was then used to rank the problems.

The strategy that worked was to:
1. Pair scores with the number of solvers for each problem.
2. Sort these pairs by score to ensure the subtasks are in the correct order.
3. Count the number of decreases in the number of solvers.
4. Use this count as a difficulty measure and sort the problems accordingly.

The problem was straightforward, and the solution involved careful handling of input and sorting logic. The constraints were manageable, and the solution efficiently handled the input size by leveraging Python's built-in sorting and list operations. The experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and using sorting as a tool to simplify complex conditions.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
p,s = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
scores = {}

for j in range(1, p + 1):
 sc = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
 ns = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
 nsc = dict(list(zip(sc,ns)))
 ssc = sorted(sc)
 score = 0
 for a,b in zip(ssc[:-1], ssc[1:]):
  if nsc[a] > nsc[b]:
   score += 1
 if score in list(scores.keys()) :
  scores[score].append(j)
 else :
  scores[score] = [j]

total_scores = sorted(list(scores.keys()))
final_list = []
for val in total_scores :
 final_list += sorted(scores[val])

for val in final_list :
 print(val)


INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, reflecting on the official solution, there are a few insights and differences worth noting:

1. **Data Structure Choice:**
   - The official solution uses a dictionary (`nsc`) to map scores to the number of solvers, which is a clear and direct way to handle the association between scores and solvers. This approach is slightly more intuitive than using a list of tuples, as it directly maps scores to their corresponding solver counts.

2. **Sorting and Counting:**
   - Both solutions sort the scores and count the number of times the solver count decreases. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to iterate over pairs of consecutive scores, which is a clean and concise way to handle this logic.

3. **Handling Ties in Difficulty:**
   - The official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) to group problems by their difficulty score, which allows for easy sorting of problems with the same difficulty. This approach is efficient and neatly handles the requirement to sort by problem index when difficulties are tied.

4. **Output Construction:**
   - The official solution constructs the final output list by first sorting the difficulty scores and then sorting the problem indices within each difficulty group. This ensures the output is in the correct order.

Overall, the official solution is slightly more elegant in its use of data structures and sorting logic. It effectively uses dictionaries to manage and sort the problems by difficulty, which is a useful pattern for similar problems involving sorting and grouping by multiple criteria.

The main function is `sort_problems_by_difficulty`.
INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] The function processes a list of problems, each defined by scores and solvers, to determine their difficulty based on how often the number of solvers decreases as scores increase. It iterates over each problem, pairs scores with solvers, and sorts these pairs by score. It then counts the number of times the solver count decreases as the score increases, using this count as a measure of difficulty. Each problem's difficulty is stored as a tuple containing this count and the problem's index. The function sorts these tuples first by the difficulty count and then by the problem index. Finally, it prints the indices of the problems in order of increasing difficulty.

[Problem]
    Mandarin chinese
    , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
    Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
    The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
    - Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
    - Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
    - Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
    - For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
    You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
    - $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

    -----Output-----
    Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le P \le 100,000$
    - $2 \le S \le 30$
    - $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
    - $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
    - in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
    Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

    -----Example Input-----
    3 3
    16 24 60
    498 861 589
