    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as the score increases. We then sort the problems by difficulty and output their indices in increasing order of difficulty.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - For each problem, pair the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.\n   - Sort these pairs by score.\n   - Count how many times the number of contestants decreases as the score increases.\n   - Use this count as the difficulty measure for the problem.\n   - Sort all problems by their difficulty measure, and if two problems have the same difficulty, sort by their index.\n   - Output the indices of the problems in the sorted order.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Read P and S\n   Initialize a list to store difficulties\n\n   For each problem i from 1 to P:\n       Read scores and number of solvers\n       Pair scores with solvers\n       Sort pairs by score\n       Initialize count n to 0\n       For each k from 0 to S-2:\n           If solvers[k] > solvers[k+1]:\n               Increment n\n       Append (n, i) to difficulties\n\n   Sort difficulties by n, then by i\n   For each difficulty in sorted difficulties:\n       Output the index i\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sort_problems_by_difficulty(P, S, problems):\n    difficulties = []\n\n    # Process each problem\n    for i in range(P):\n        scores = problems[2 * i]\n        solvers = problems[2 * i + 1]\n\n        # Pair scores with solvers and sort by score\n        score_solver_pairs = sorted(zip(scores, solvers))\n\n        # Count the number of times solvers decrease as score increases\n        n = 0\n        for k in range(S - 1):\n            if score_solver_pairs[k][1] > score_solver_pairs[k + 1][1]:\n                n += 1\n\n        # Store the difficulty as a tuple (n, i+1)\n        difficulties.append((n, i + 1))\n\n    # Sort difficulties by n, then by i\n    difficulties.sort()\n\n    # Output the indices of the problems in sorted order\n    for _, index in difficulties:\n        print(index)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nP = int(data[0])\nS = int(data[1])\nproblems = []\n\n# Read the problems' scores and solvers\nindex = 2\nfor _ in range(P):\n    scores = list(map(int, data[index:index + S]))\n    solvers = list(map(int, data[index + S:index + 2 * S]))\n    problems.append(scores)\n    problems.append(solvers)\n    index += 2 * S\n\n# Call the function to sort and print the problems by difficulty\nsort_problems_by_difficulty(P, S, problems)\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes each problem to determine its difficulty, sorts the problems by difficulty, and then outputs the indices of the problems in the required order.",
