Just a new idea. Now Chef is expanding his business. He wants to make some new restaurants in the big city of Lviv. To make his business competitive he should interest customers. Now he knows how. But don't tell anyone -  it is a secret plan. Chef knows four national Ukrainian dishes - salo, borsch, varenyky and galushky. It is too few, of course, but enough for the beginning. Every day in his restaurant will be a dish of the day among these four ones. And dishes of the consecutive days must be different. To make the scheme more refined the dish of the first day and the dish of the last day must be different too. Now he wants his assistant to make schedule for some period. Chef suspects that there is more than one possible schedule. Hence he wants his assistant to prepare all possible plans so that he can choose the best one among them. He asks you for help. At first tell him how many such schedules exist. Since the answer can be large output it modulo 109 + 7, that is, you need to output the remainder of division of the actual answer by 109 + 7.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains a single integer N denoting the number of days for which the schedule should be made.\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case output a single integer in a separate line, the answer for the corresponding test case.\n\n-----Constraints-----1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 109\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3\n2\n3\n5\n\nOutput:\n12\n24\n240\n\n-----Explanation-----\nCase 1. For N = 2 days we have the following 12 schedules:\nFirst day Second day  salo   borsch    salo   varenyky    salo   galushky    borsch   salo    borsch   varenyky    borsch   galushky    varenyky   salo    varenyky   borsch    varenyky   galushky    galushky   salo    galushky   borsch    galushky   varenyky  \n\nCase 2. For N = 3 we have the following 24 schedules:\nFirst daySecond dayThird day  salo   borsch   varenyky    salo   borsch   galushky    salo   varenyky   borsch    salo   varenyky   galushky    salo   galushky   borsch    salo   galushky   varenyky    borsch   salo   varenyky    borsch   salo   galushky    borsch   varenyky   salo    borsch   varenyky   galushky    borsch   galushky   salo    borsch   galushky   varenyky    varenyky   salo   borsch    varenyky   salo   galushky    varenyky   borsch   salo    varenyky   borsch   galushky    varenyky   galushky   salo    varenyky   galushky   borsch    galushky   salo   borsch    galushky   salo   varenyky    galushky   borsch   salo    galushky   borsch   varenyky    galushky   varenyky   salo    galushky   varenyky   borsch  \n\nCase 3. Don't be afraid. This time we will not provide you with a table of 240 schedules. The only thing we want to mention here is that apart from the previous two cases schedules for other values of N can have equal dishes (and even must have for N > 4). For example the schedule (salo, borsch, salo, borsch) is a correct schedule for N = 4 while the schedule (varenyky, salo, galushky, verynky, salo) is a correct schedule for N = 5.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a schedule for Chef's restaurant where each day features a different dish from a set of four Ukrainian dishes: salo, borsch, varenyky, and galushky. The schedule must satisfy the following conditions:\n- The dish of the day must be different from the previous day's dish.\n- The dish on the first day must be different from the dish on the last day.\nGiven the number of days \\( N \\), we need to determine how many such valid schedules exist. The result should be given modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each day, we have 4 choices initially. However, from the second day onward, we have only 3 choices because the dish must be different from the previous day. Additionally, the first and last days must have different dishes.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - For \\( N = 2 \\), we can choose any of the 4 dishes for the first day and any of the remaining 3 dishes for the second day, resulting in \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\) schedules.\n   - For \\( N = 3 \\), we can choose any of the 4 dishes for the first day, any of the 3 for the second day, and any of the 3 for the third day, resulting in \\( 4 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 36 \\) schedules. However, we must subtract the cases where the first and last days are the same, which are \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\), resulting in \\( 36 - 12 = 24 \\) valid schedules.\n\n3. **General Formula**:\n   - For \\( N \\geq 3 \\), the number of valid schedules is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \\times 3^{(N-1)} - 3^{(N-2)}\n     \\]\n   - This formula accounts for all possible schedules and subtracts those where the first and last days are the same.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate_schedules(N):\n    MOD = 10^9 + 7\n    if N == 2:\n        return 12\n    else:\n        power1 = 3^(N-1) % MOD\n        power2 = 3^(N-2) % MOD\n        result = (4 * power1 - power2) % MOD\n        return result\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read N\n        print calculate_schedules(N)\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_schedules(N):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    if N == 2:\n        return 12\n    else:\n        # Calculate 3^(N-1) % MOD\n        power1 = pow(3, N-1, MOD)\n        # Calculate 3^(N-2) % MOD\n        power2 = pow(3, N-2, MOD)\n        # Calculate the result using the formula\n        result = (4 * power1 - power2) % MOD\n        return result\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        results.append(calculate_schedules(N))\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the number of valid schedules using the derived formula, taking care to apply the modulo operation to handle large numbers."

So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.\n        - \n        Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.\n        - \n        Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ### Problem Restatement\n\n        Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Given `N` setters, each with a certain number of problems, Chef wants to know the maximum number of contests he can host over `D` days, with the constraint that only one contest can be hosted per day.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.\n\n        2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total number of problems. This is done by integer division of the total problems by `K`.\n\n        3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the number of full contests possible and `D`.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function max_contests(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                N, K, D = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                total_problems = sum(A)\n                max_possible_contests = total_problems // K\n                max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)\n        \n                results.append(max_contests)\n    \n            return results\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for i in range(T):\n                N, K, D = test_cases[i][0]\n                A = test_cases[i][1]\n        \n                # Calculate the total number of problems available\n                total_problems = sum(A)\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum number of contests that can be formed\n                max_possible_contests = total_problems // K\n        \n                # The actual number of contests is limited by the number of days D\n                max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)\n        \n                results.append(max_contests)\n    \n            return results\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                D = int(data[index + 2])\n                index += 3\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append(((N, K, D), A))\n    \n            results = max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Input Handling**: The input is read in a single block for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The data is split and parsed into integers as needed.\n        - **Logic**: For each test case, the total number of problems is calculated. The number of full contests that can be formed is determined by dividing the total problems by `K`.

He starts in city 1 and has `K` seconds to move between cities. Each second, he can move to an adjacent city or stay in the current city. Ryan has `Q` conditions specifying that he must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. We need to determine how many different trips Ryan can make that satisfy all conditions, modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges.\n\n        2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each city at each second.\n\n        3. **Initial State**: Start with Ryan in city 1 at time 0.\n\n        4. **Transition**: For each second, update the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach its adjacent cities in the previous second.\n\n        5. **Condition Checking**: Ensure that the conditions `(a_i, b_i)` are satisfied by checking if the number of ways to be in city `a_i` at time `b_i` is non-zero.\n\n        6. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, compute the number of trips modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ##

Given the number of days \\( N \\), we need to determine how many such valid schedules exist, modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - We have four dishes and need to create a schedule for \\( N \\) days.\n   - Consecutive days must have different dishes.\n   - The first and last days must also have different dishes.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - For \\( N = 2 \\), we can choose any dish for the first day and any of the remaining three dishes for the second day. This gives \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\) schedules.\n   - For \\( N = 3 \\), we can choose any dish for the first day, any of the remaining three for the second day, and any of the remaining three for the third day (since the first and third days must be different).

Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. \n\n        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Mistake in the Solution\n\n        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `2 * i * i <= N` is incorrect. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not 2 * i * i. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N. This is because the sum of the first k natural numbers is k * (k + 1) / 2, and we need to find the largest k such that this sum is less than or equal to N. This k will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        Let's implement the correct logic:\n\n        ```python\n        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                count = 0\n                # Find the largest k such that k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N\n                k = 1\n                while k * (k + 1) // 2 <= N:\n                    count += 1\n                    k += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - We iterate over each test case.\n        - For each N, we find the largest k such that the sum of the first k natural numbers (k * (k + 1) / 2) is less than or equal to N.\n        - This k represents the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n        - We print the result for each test case.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's correct the solution based on the insights from the problem analysis.

Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. \n\n        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Mistake in the Solution\n\n        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N` is incorrect for this problem. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not the sum of the first k natural numbers. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * k <= N. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        Let's implement the correct logic:\n\n        ```python\n        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                count = 0\n                # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n                k = 1\n                while k * k <= N:\n                    count += 1\n                    k += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.\n        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`.

Each test case provides a single integer N, and we need to output the N'th number in the series.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Identify the Pattern**: \n           - The series starts with 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...\n           - The differences between consecutive terms are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...\n           - These differences are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, ...\n\n        2. **Formulate the Series**:\n           - The N'th term can be expressed as a sum of squares: \n             - \\( S(N) = 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + (N-1)^2 \\)\n           - This is a known mathematical series where the sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers is given by:\n             - \\( S(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2N-1)}{6} \\)\n\n        3. **Plan the Solution**:\n           - For each test case, compute the N'th term using the formula for the sum of squares.\n           - Output the result for each test case.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function calculate_nth_term(N):\n            return (N-1) * N * (2*N-1) // 6\n\n        function main():\n            read T\n            for each test case:\n                read N\n                result = calculate_nth_term(N)\n                print result\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def calculate_nth_term(N):\n            # Calculate the N'th term using the sum of squares formula\n            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * N - 1) // 6\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            results = []\n    \n            for i in range(1, T + 1):\n                N = int(data[i])\n                result = calculate_nth_term(N)\n                results.append(result)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **calculate_nth_term**: This function computes the N'th term in the series using the formula for the sum of squares.\n        - **main**: This function handles input and output. It reads all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints, and processes each test case to compute and print the result.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['3', '1', '7', '8'] Output: 0\n        91\n        140\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.\n        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.\n        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.\n\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\n        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.\n        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each test case print required answer.\n\n        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=1000000\n        Subtask 3: 5 points\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=16\n        - 1<=Q<=1000\n        Subtask 1: 25 points\n        - T=1\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=100000\n        Subtask 2: 70 points\n        - Original Constraints.\n\n        -----Example:-----\n        Input:\n\n        1\n\n        3 3\n\n        1 2\n\n        2 1\n\n        3 2\n\n        Output:\n\n        0\n\n        2\n\n        2\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        For N=3\n\n        total subsets are:\n\n        {1}\n\n        {2}\n\n        {3}\n\n        {1,2}\n\n        {1,3}\n\n        {2,3}\n\n        {1,2,3}\n\n        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.\n\n        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.\n\n        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:\n\n        ### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n        1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.\n\n        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.\n\n        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.\n\n        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.\n\n        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.\n\n        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.\n\n        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.\n\n        ### Potential Issues\n\n        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.\n\n        ### Correction\n\n        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.\n\n        ### Corrected Code\n\n        ```python\n        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)\n            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod\n\n        def solve_queries():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, MOD)\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                        results.append(result)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)) + \"\\n\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute the solution\n        solve_queries()\n        ```\n\n        This corrected code should now properly execute and produce the expected output for the given test cases.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's correct the solution by ensuring that the `solve_queries()` function is called.

He want to distribute equal number of tiles from $i^{th}$ box to any two rooms (each room must belong to one house ) such that all tiles  of $i^ { th}$  box is used and floor of  both rooms of different houses are tiled completely.\n        Since chef is busy doing some other works so he wants your help to count the total number of rooms of both houses that will be tiled completely.\n        Note $:$ size of  each tile present in boxes has length and breadth equal to $1$.

Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. \n\n        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Mistake in the Solution\n\n        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `2 * i * i <= N` is incorrect. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not 2 * i * i. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N. This is because the sum of the first k natural numbers is k * (k + 1) / 2, and we need to find the largest k such that this sum is less than or equal to N. This k will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        Let's implement the correct logic:\n\n        ```python\n        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                count = 0\n                # Find the largest k such that k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N\n                k = 1\n                while k * (k + 1) // 2 <= N:\n                    count += 1\n                    k += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - We iterate over each test case.\n        - For each N, we find the largest k such that the sum of the first k natural numbers (k * (k + 1) / 2) is less than or equal to N.\n        - This k represents the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n        - We print the result for each test case.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's correct the solution based on the insights from the problem analysis. The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is `k * (k + 1) / 2`, is less than or equal to `N`. This `k` will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        Here's the corrected Python code:\n\n        ```python\n        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                count = 0\n                # Find the largest k such that k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N\n                k = 1\n                while k * (k + 1) // 2 <= N:\n                    count += 1\n                    k += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.\n        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`.

Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. \n\n        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Mistake in the Solution\n\n        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N` is incorrect for this problem. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not the sum of the first k natural numbers. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * k <= N. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        Let's implement the correct logic:\n\n        ```python\n        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                count = 0\n                # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n                k = 1\n                while k * k <= N:\n                    count += 1\n                    k += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.\n        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is done using a simple loop.\n        - **Output Results**: For each test case, we print the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        This solution correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's correct the solution based on the insights from the problem analysis. The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N`.

The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\nThe initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\n**Correct Strategy:**\nThe correct formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\]\nThis formula:\n- Starts with 4 choices for the first day.\n- Uses \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.\n- Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.\n\n**Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**\nThe main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n**Final Code Snippet:**\n```python\ndef count_schedules(N):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    if N == 2:\n        return 12\n    else:\n        return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        result = count_schedules(N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints."

The formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Schedules}(N) = 3^N + (-1)^N \\times 3\n   \\]\n   This formula cleverly accounts for the constraints by using alternating signs to adjust for invalid cases where the first and last days are the same.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: The use of Python's `pow` function with three arguments efficiently computes powers with a modulus, which is crucial for handling large numbers due to the constraints \\( 2 \\leq N \\leq 10^9 \\).\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The official solution is concise and avoids the complexity of manually iterating over possible schedules or overcomplicating the formula. It directly computes the result using a mathematical expression.\n\n### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Mathematical Formulation**: Sometimes, problems that seem combinatorial can be solved with a direct mathematical formula. Recognizing patterns and leveraging mathematical properties can lead to more efficient solutions.\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: Understanding and applying modular arithmetic is crucial in competitive programming, especially when dealing with large numbers.\n- **Simplicity and Elegance**: The official solution demonstrates how a simple and elegant approach can be more effective than a complex one. It highlights the importance of stepping back and considering different perspectives or mathematical insights when a problem seems challenging.\n\nThis experience underscores the value of mathematical reasoning and the power of concise solutions in programming challenges."
