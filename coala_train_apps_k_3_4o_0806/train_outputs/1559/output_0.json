    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nChef wants to create a schedule for his restaurant where each day features a different dish from a set of four Ukrainian dishes: salo, borsch, varenyky, and galushky. The schedule must ensure that no two consecutive days have the same dish, and the first and last days must also feature different dishes. Given the number of days \\( N \\), we need to determine how many such valid schedules exist, modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - We have four dishes and need to create a schedule for \\( N \\) days.\n   - Consecutive days must have different dishes.\n   - The first and last days must also have different dishes.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - For \\( N = 2 \\), we can choose any dish for the first day and any of the remaining three dishes for the second day. This gives \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\) schedules.\n   - For \\( N = 3 \\), we can choose any dish for the first day, any of the remaining three for the second day, and any of the remaining three for the third day (since the first and third days must be different). This gives \\( 4 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 36 \\) schedules.\n\n3. **General Formula**:\n   - For \\( N \\geq 3 \\), the number of valid schedules can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2\n     \\]\n   - This formula accounts for:\n     - 4 choices for the first day.\n     - \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) choices for the middle days (each day can be any of the three dishes not used the previous day).\n     - 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**:\n   - Since the result can be large, compute the number of schedules modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_schedules(N):\n    MOD = 10^9 + 7\n    if N == 2:\n        return 12\n    else:\n        return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read N\n        result = count_schedules(N)\n        print result\n```\n\n## Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef count_schedules(N):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    if N == 2:\n        return 12\n    else:\n        return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        result = count_schedules(N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **count_schedules**: This function calculates the number of valid schedules for \\( N \\) days using the derived formula. It handles the special case for \\( N = 2 \\) separately.\n- **main**: This function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result. It uses efficient input handling to accommodate large constraints.",
