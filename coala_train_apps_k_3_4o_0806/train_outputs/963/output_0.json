    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nIn ChefLand, there is a mountain range with hills of varying heights. Ada wants to place water reservoirs on some hills such that water can flow optimally to cover all hills. Water from a reservoir flows in one direction until it reaches a hill that is taller than the hill with the reservoir. The task is to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to ensure all hills receive water.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Water Flow**: Water from a reservoir on a hill can flow left or right until it encounters a hill taller than the reservoir's hill. This means that a reservoir can cover all hills up to the first taller hill in the chosen direction.\n\n2. **Optimal Reservoir Placement**:\n   - We need to ensure that every hill is covered by at least one reservoir.\n   - To minimize the number of reservoirs, we should place them at strategic points where they can cover the maximum number of hills.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Traverse the list of hills from left to right to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to cover all hills.\n   - Use a greedy approach: place a reservoir at a hill and let it cover as many hills as possible until a taller hill is encountered.\n   - Repeat the process until all hills are covered.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction min_reservoirs(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, heights = test_case\n        reservoirs = 0\n        i = 0\n        while i < N:\n            reservoirs += 1\n            current_height = heights[i]\n            # Move to the right until a taller hill is found\n            while i < N and heights[i] <= current_height:\n                i += 1\n        print(reservoirs)\n```\n\n### Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef min_reservoirs(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, heights = test_case\n        reservoirs = 0\n        i = 0\n        while i < N:\n            reservoirs += 1\n            current_height = heights[i]\n            # Move to the right until a taller hill is found\n            while i < N and heights[i] <= current_height:\n                i += 1\n        results.append(reservoirs)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        heights = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        test_cases.append((N, heights))\n    \n    min_reservoirs(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Input Handling**: The input is read in a single block and split into manageable parts. Each test case is processed separately.\n- **Reservoir Placement**: For each test case, we iterate through the list of hill heights. We place a reservoir at the current hill and move right until a taller hill is encountered, incrementing the reservoir count each time we place a new reservoir.\n- **Output**: The results for each test case are collected and printed at the end.",
