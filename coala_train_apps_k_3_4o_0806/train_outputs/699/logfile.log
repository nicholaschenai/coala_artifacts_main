## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (40 points):
- $N = 1$

3 3 300
1 1 1

-----Sample Output:-----
0
2
7
4
1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan contests for the next `D` days, but he can host at most one contest per day. The task is to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host given these constraints.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.
2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.
3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.
4. **Output the Result**: For each test case, output the maximum number of contests that can be hosted.

### Pseudocode

```
for each test case:
    read N, K, D
    read the list of problems created by each setter
    total_problems = sum of all problems
    max_contests = total_problems // K
    result = min(max_contests, D)
    print result
```

### Python Solution

```python
def max_division_3_contests():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        D = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        problems = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        total_problems = sum(problems)
        max_contests = total_problems // K
        results.append(min(max_contests, D))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, we extract the number of setters `N`, the number of problems needed per contest `K`, and the number of days `D`.
- **Calculate Total Problems**: We sum up the problems from all setters.
- **Determine Maximum Contests**: We calculate how many contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by `K`.
- **Limit by Days**: We take the minimum of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days `D`.
- **Output**: We store the result for each test case and print them at the end.

        total subsets are:

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        ### Step-by-Step Analysis

        1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.

        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.

        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.

        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.

        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.

        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.

        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.

        ### Potential Issues

        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.

        ### Correction

        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.

        ### Corrected Code

        ```python
        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod
            return factorials, inverses

        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0

            data = input().split()

            max_n = 4000

                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD
                        results.append(result)

        # Call the function to execute the solution
        solve_queries()
        ```

        This corrected code should now properly execute and produce the expected output for the given test cases.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's correct the solution by ensuring that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This will allow the program to execute and produce the expected output. Here is the corrected Python code:

        This code should now correctly read input, process each test case, and output the results as expected. The main issue was that the function `solve_queries()` was not being called, which has now been fixed.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(I-1, K-1)\).

        3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \(2^{N-I}\) possible combinations.

        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)

                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod-2, mod)
            for i from max_n-1 down to 1:
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod
            return factorials, inverses

        function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod

        function solve_queries(T, queries, mod):
            max_n = 4000
            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod)
            results = []
            for each test case:
                read N and Q
                for each query:
                    read I and K
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverses, mod)
                        count_greater = pow(2, N-I, mod)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % mod
                        results.append(result)

                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)

            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")
        ```

        This code efficiently handles the problem by precomputing factorials and their inverses, allowing for quick computation of binomial coefficients and powers of 2, which are essential for solving each query.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Given `N` setters, each with a certain number of problems, Chef wants to know the maximum number of contests he can host over `D` days, with the constraint that only one contest can be hosted per day.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.

2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total number of problems. This is done by integer division of the total problems by `K`.

3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the number of full contests possible and `D`.

### Pseudocode

    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        total_problems = sum(A)
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        results.append(max_contests)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**: The input is read in a single block for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The data is split and parsed into integers as needed.
- **Logic**: For each test case, the total number of problems is calculated. The number of full contests that can be formed is determined by dividing the total problems by `K`. The result is then limited by `D`, the number of days available.
- **Output**: The results for each test case are printed in sequence.

### Explanation

- **Input Handling**: The input is read in a single block for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The data is split and parsed into integers as needed.
- **Logic**: For each test case, the total number of problems is calculated. The number of full contests that can be formed is determined by dividing the total problems by `K`. The result is then limited by `D`, the number of days available.
- **Output**: The results for each test case are printed in sequence.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Given `N` setters, each with a certain number of problems, Chef wants to know the maximum number of contests he can host over `D` days, with the constraint that only one contest can be hosted per day.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.

2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total number of problems. This is done by integer division of the total problems by `K`.

3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the number of full contests possible and `D`.

### Pseudocode

```
function max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = test_case[0]
        A = test_case[1]
        
        total_problems = sum(A)
        max_possible_contests = total_problems // K
        max_contests = min(max_possible_contests, D)
        
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    return results
```

### Final Python Code

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []

        N, K, D = test_cases[i][0]

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints. The problem required understanding how to efficiently calculate the number of contests based on the total number of problems available and the constraints of days and problems per contest.

The key steps involved:
1. **Summing Problems**: Calculate the total number of problems available from all setters.
2. **Calculating Contests**: Determine how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`).
3. **Limiting by Days**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days (`D`), so the final result is the minimum of the possible contests and the available days.

The solution was straightforward once the constraints were clearly understood. The main challenge was ensuring that the logic correctly handled the constraints and efficiently processed multiple test cases. The use of integer division and the `min` function were crucial in determining the correct number of contests.

The problem reinforced the importance of breaking down constraints and using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems efficiently. The solution was implemented in Python, leveraging built-in functions for input handling and arithmetic operations. This approach can be applied to similar problems where resources are limited by multiple constraints.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for T in range(int (eval(input()))):
 N,K,D=list(map(int,input().split()))
 A=list(map(int,input().split()))
 P=sum(A)//K 
 print(min(P,D))


INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] In this problem, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is straightforward given the problem constraints. The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted, given the number of problems available and the number of days.

### Key Insights:

1. **Problem Breakdown**: Both solutions correctly identify that the total number of problems needs to be divided by `K` to determine how many full contests can be formed. This is a simple division operation.

2. **Limiting Factor**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the final result is the minimum of the number of full contests possible and `D`.

3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is concise and efficient, using list comprehensions and direct input handling. It avoids unnecessary complexity and directly computes the required values.

### Reflection:

- **Simplicity and Clarity**: The official solution is a good reminder of the power of simplicity. It uses minimal lines of code to achieve the desired result, which is both efficient and easy to understand.

- **Input Handling**: The official solution uses `eval(input())` for reading input, which is a quick way to handle multiple test cases. However, in practice, using `sys.stdin.read` can be more efficient for large inputs, as it reads all input at once.

- **Direct Calculation**: The use of `sum(A)//K` directly in the print statement is a neat way to avoid extra variables, making the code more concise.

Overall, this problem reinforces the importance of understanding the constraints and using them to simplify the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and for each test case, the number of problems, the number of problems required per contest, and the number of days available. It then processes each test case to determine the maximum number of contests that can be held, given the constraints of the total number of problems available and the number of days. The results for each test case are calculated by dividing the total number of problems by the number of problems required per contest and taking the minimum of this value and the number of days. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

[Problem]
    Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
    A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
    Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
    - The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
    - $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
    - $1 \le D \le 10^9$
    - $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (40 points):
    - $N = 1$
    - $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
    Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    5
    1 5 31
    4
    1 10 3
    23
    2 5 7
    20 36
    2 5 10
    19 2
    3 3 300
    1 1 1

    -----Sample Output:-----
    0
    2
    7
    4
    1

    -----Explanation:-----
    - 
    Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
    - 
    Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
    - 
    Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.
