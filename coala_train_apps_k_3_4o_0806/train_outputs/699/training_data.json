    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted given a set of constraints. The problem required understanding how to efficiently calculate the number of contests based on the total number of problems available and the constraints of days and problems per contest.\n\nThe key steps involved:\n1. **Summing Problems**: Calculate the total number of problems available from all setters.\n2. **Calculating Contests**: Determine how many full contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required per contest (`K`).\n3. **Limiting by Days**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days (`D`), so the final result is the minimum of the possible contests and the available days.\n\nThe solution was straightforward once the constraints were clearly understood. The main challenge was ensuring that the logic correctly handled the constraints and efficiently processed multiple test cases. The use of integer division and the `min` function were crucial in determining the correct number of contests.\n\nThe problem reinforced the importance of breaking down constraints and using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems efficiently. The solution was implemented in Python, leveraging built-in functions for input handling and arithmetic operations. This approach can be applied to similar problems where resources are limited by multiple constraints.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is straightforward given the problem constraints. The task is to determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted, given the number of problems available and the number of days.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Problem Breakdown**: Both solutions correctly identify that the total number of problems needs to be divided by `K` to determine how many full contests can be formed. This is a simple division operation.\n\n2. **Limiting Factor**: The number of contests is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the final result is the minimum of the number of full contests possible and `D`.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is concise and efficient, using list comprehensions and direct input handling. It avoids unnecessary complexity and directly computes the required values.\n\n### Reflection:\n\n- **Simplicity and Clarity**: The official solution is a good reminder of the power of simplicity. It uses minimal lines of code to achieve the desired result, which is both efficient and easy to understand.\n\n- **Input Handling**: The official solution uses `eval(input())` for reading input, which is a quick way to handle multiple test cases. However, in practice, using `sys.stdin.read` can be more efficient for large inputs, as it reads all input at once.\n\n- **Direct Calculation**: The use of `sum(A)//K` directly in the print statement is a neat way to avoid extra variables, making the code more concise.\n\nOverall, this problem reinforces the importance of understanding the constraints and using them to simplify the solution. The official solution is a good example of how to write clean and efficient code for competitive programming problems.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and for each test case, the number of problems, the number of problems required per contest, and the number of days available. It then processes each test case to determine the maximum number of contests that can be held, given the constraints of the total number of problems available and the number of days. The results for each test case are calculated by dividing the total number of problems by the number of problems required per contest and taking the minimum of this value and the number of days. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the maximum number of events or tasks that can be scheduled given certain constraints, such as limited resources and time. For example, in project management, you might have a set number of resources (like team members or equipment) and a limited time frame to complete as many tasks as possible. This problem-solving approach can also be applied to scheduling tournaments, organizing events, or any situation where you need to optimize the use of available resources over a given period. The key is to calculate the total resources available, determine how many complete sets of resources are needed for each task, and then limit the number of tasks by the available time or other constraints."
