Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \\leq i \\leq N$.    \nA Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.\nGiven these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.\n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$ respectively. \n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^2$\n- $1 \\le K \\le 10^9$ \n- $1 \\le D \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le A_i \\le 10^7$ for each valid $i$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (40 points):\n- $N = 1$\n- $1 \\le A_1 \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n5\n1 5 31\n4\n1 10 3\n23\n2 5 7\n20 36\n2 5 10\n19 2\n3 3 300\n1 1 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n0\n2\n7\n4\n1\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- \nExample case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.\n- \nExample case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.\n- \nExample case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nChef wants to host Division-3 contests using problems created by setters. Each contest requires exactly `K` problems. Chef has `N` setters, and each setter has created a certain number of problems. Chef wants to plan contests for the next `D` days, but he can host at most one contest per day. The task is to determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host given these constraints.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.\n2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total problems by dividing the total number of problems by `K`.\n3. **Limit by Days**: The number of contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days `D`. Therefore, the maximum number of contests is the minimum of the contests that can be formed and `D`.\n4. **Output the Result**: For each test case, output the maximum number of contests that can be hosted.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfor each test case:\n    read N, K, D\n    read the list of problems created by each setter\n    total_problems = sum of all problems\n    max_contests = total_problems // K\n    result = min(max_contests, D)\n    print result\n```\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_division_3_contests():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        K = int(data[index + 1])\n        D = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        problems = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        \n        total_problems = sum(problems)\n        max_contests = total_problems // K\n        results.append(min(max_contests, D))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: We read all input at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, we extract the number of setters `N`, the number of problems needed per contest `K`, and the number of days `D`.\n- **Calculate Total Problems**: We sum up the problems from all setters.\n- **Determine Maximum Contests**: We calculate how many contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by `K`.\n- **Limit by Days**: We take the minimum of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days `D`.\n- **Output**: We store the result for each test case and print them at the end."

This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.\n\n        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.\n\n        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.\n\n        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.\n\n        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.\n\n        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.\n\n        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.\n\n        ### Potential Issues\n\n        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.\n\n        ### Correction\n\n        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called.

Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n    #### Strategies and Missteps\n    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\n    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`.

The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.\n\n        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \\(C(I-1, K-1)\\).\n\n        3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \\(2^{N-I}\\) possible combinations.\n\n        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i from 2 to max_n:\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod-2, mod)\n            for i from max_n-1 down to 1:\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod\n\n        function solve_queries(T, queries, mod):\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod)\n            results = []\n            for each test case:\n                read N and Q\n                for each query:\n                    read I and K\n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I-1, K-1, factorials, inverses, mod)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N-I, mod)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % mod\n                        results.append(result)\n            return results\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):\n            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod\n            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)\n            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):\n                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod\n            return factorials, inverses\n\n        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):\n            if k > n or k < 0:\n                return 0\n            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod\n\n        def solve_queries():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            max_n = 4000\n            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, MOD)\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    I = int(data[index])\n                    K = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    if K > I:\n                        results.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)\n                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)\n                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD\n                        results.append(result)\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)) + \"\\n\")\n        ```\n\n        This code efficiently handles the problem by precomputing factorials and their inverses, allowing for quick computation of binomial coefficients and powers of 2, which are essential for solving each query.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['1', '3 3', '1 2', '2 1', '3 2'] Expected output: [{'0'}, {'2'}, {'2'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.

Given `N` setters, each with a certain number of problems, Chef wants to know the maximum number of contests he can host over `D` days, with the constraint that only one contest can be hosted per day.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Calculate Total Problems**: For each test case, sum up all the problems created by the `N` setters.\n\n2. **Determine Maximum Contests**: Calculate how many full contests can be formed with the total number of problems.

The data is split and parsed into integers as needed.\n- **Logic**: For each test case, the total number of problems is calculated. The number of full contests that can be formed is determined by dividing the total problems by `K`.

It uses minimal lines of code to achieve the desired result, which is both efficient and easy to understand.\n\n- **Input Handling**: The official solution uses `eval(input())` for reading input, which is a quick way to handle multiple test cases. However, in practice, using `sys.stdin.read` can be more efficient for large inputs, as it reads all input at once.\n\n- **Direct Calculation**: The use of `sum(A)//K` directly in the print statement is a neat way to avoid extra variables, making the code more concise.\n\nOverall, this problem reinforces the importance of understanding the constraints and using them to simplify the solution.

This problem-solving approach can also be applied to scheduling tournaments, organizing events, or any situation where you need to optimize the use of available resources over a given period.
