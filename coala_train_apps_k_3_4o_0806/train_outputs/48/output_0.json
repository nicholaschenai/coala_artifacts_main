    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nYou start with one stick and want to craft `k` torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade:\n1. 1 stick for `x` sticks.\n2. `y` sticks for 1 coal.\n\nYour goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches for multiple test cases.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements**:\n   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.\n   - You start with 1 stick.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed**:\n   - You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals.\n   - Total sticks needed = `k + k * y`.\n\n3. **Determine Trades for Sticks**:\n   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k + k * y - 1` additional sticks.\n   - Each trade gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick to gain `x` sticks).\n   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks: `ceil((k + k * y - 1) / (x - 1))`.\n\n4. **Total Trades**:\n   - The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and `k` trades for coals.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        x, y, k = test_case\n        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y\n        additional_sticks_needed = total_sticks_needed - 1\n        trades_for_sticks = ceil(additional_sticks_needed / (x - 1))\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n        append total_trades to results\n    return results\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for x, y, k in test_cases:\n        # Calculate total sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y\n        # Calculate additional sticks needed beyond the initial 1 stick\n        additional_sticks_needed = total_sticks_needed - 1\n        # Calculate trades needed to get the required sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (additional_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)\n        # Total trades include trades for sticks and trades for coals\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n        results.append(total_trades)\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        x = int(data[index])\n        y = int(data[index + 1])\n        k = int(data[index + 2])\n        test_cases.append((x, y, k))\n        index += 3\n    \n    results = minimum_trades(t, test_cases)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into test cases.\n- **Logic**: For each test case, calculate the total number of trades needed by determining the number of trades required to gather enough sticks and then adding the number of trades needed to acquire the coals.\n- **Output**: The results are printed for each test case.",
