You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. Specifically, you can:\n- Trade 1 stick to get `x` sticks.\n- Trade `y` sticks to get 1 coal.\n\nYour goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft at least `k` torches. You have `t` test cases to solve.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals.\n   - You start with 1 stick.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Sticks Needed:**\n   - You need `k` sticks for the torches and `k * y` sticks to trade for `k` coals.\n   - Total sticks needed = `k + k * y`.\n\n3. **Determine Trades for Sticks:**\n   - You start with 1 stick, so you need `k + k * y - 1` additional sticks.\n   - Each trade for sticks gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick in the trade).\n   - Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{trades\\_for\\_sticks} = \\lceil \\frac{k + k \\cdot y - 1}{x - 1} \\rceil\n     \\]\n   - This can be computed using integer arithmetic as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{trades\\_for\\_sticks} = \\frac{k + k \\cdot y - 1 + (x - 2)}{x - 1}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Trades for Coal:**\n   - You need exactly `k` trades to get `k` coals.\n\n5. **Total Trades:**\n   - The total number of trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coal.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        x, y, k = test_case\n        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)\n        trades_for_coal = k\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal\n        append total_trades to results\n    return results\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for i in range(t):\n        x, y, k = test_cases[i]\n        \n        # Calculate total sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k + k * y\n        \n        # Calculate trades needed to get enough sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed - 1 + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)\n        \n        # Calculate trades needed to get enough coal\n        trades_for_coal = k\n        \n        # Total trades is the sum of both\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coal\n        \n        results.append(total_trades)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# t = 5\n# test_cases = [(2, 1, 5), (42, 13, 24), (12, 11, 12), (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000), (2, 1000000000, 1000000000)]\n# print(minimum_trades(t, test_cases))\n```\n\nThis solution reads the number of test cases and their respective parameters, calculates the minimum number of trades needed for each test case, and outputs the results."

Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n    #### Strategies and Missteps\n    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\n    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            count = 0\n            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n            k = 1\n            while k * k <= N:\n                count += 1\n                k += 1\n            results.append(count)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum of a subsequence of Pok\u00e9mon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, K = test_case[0]\n            demands = test_case[1]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n            index += 2\n            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
