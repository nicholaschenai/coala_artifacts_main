    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a list where each element represents the price of a stock on a particular day. We need to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying and then selling the stock. We cannot hold more than one stock at a time, meaning we must sell the stock before buying again.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum profit achievable with up to two transactions. We will maintain two arrays:\n   - `first_buy_sell_profit`: This array will store the maximum profit achievable up to each day with one transaction.\n   - `second_buy_sell_profit`: This array will store the maximum profit achievable up to each day with two transactions.\n\n   The idea is to iterate through the list of prices twice:\n   - In the first pass, calculate the maximum profit for each day if we were to make only one transaction.\n   - In the second pass, calculate the maximum profit for each day if we were to make two transactions, using the results from the first pass.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function maxProfit(prices):\n       if prices is empty:\n           return 0\n\n       n = length of prices\n       first_buy_sell_profit = array of zeros with length n\n       second_buy_sell_profit = array of zeros with length n\n\n       # First pass: calculate max profit with one transaction\n       min_price = prices[0]\n       for i from 1 to n-1:\n           min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])\n           first_buy_sell_profit[i] = max(first_buy_sell_profit[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)\n\n       # Second pass: calculate max profit with two transactions\n       max_price = prices[n-1]\n       for i from n-2 to 0:\n           max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])\n           second_buy_sell_profit[i] = max(second_buy_sell_profit[i+1], max_price - prices[i] + first_buy_sell_profit[i])\n\n       return second_buy_sell_profit[0]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n        if not prices:\n            return 0\n\n        n = len(prices)\n        first_buy_sell_profit = [0] * n\n        second_buy_sell_profit = [0] * n\n\n        # First pass: calculate max profit with one transaction\n        min_price = prices[0]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            # Update the minimum price seen so far\n            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])\n            # Calculate the maximum profit for one transaction up to day i\n            first_buy_sell_profit[i] = max(first_buy_sell_profit[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)\n\n        # Second pass: calculate max profit with two transactions\n        max_price = prices[n-1]\n        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n            # Update the maximum price seen so far from the end\n            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])\n            # Calculate the maximum profit for two transactions up to day i\n            second_buy_sell_profit[i] = max(second_buy_sell_profit[i+1], max_price - prices[i] + first_buy_sell_profit[i])\n\n        # The maximum profit with at most two transactions\n        return second_buy_sell_profit[0]\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit by using dynamic programming to track the best possible outcomes for one and two transactions, iterating through the list of prices twice.",
