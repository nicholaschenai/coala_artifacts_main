## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Â             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Â             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
Â             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:


Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a list where each element represents the price of a stock on a given day. We need to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying and then selling the stock. We cannot hold more than one stock at a time, meaning we must sell the stock before buying again.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to consider the possibility of making up to two transactions. We can break down the problem into two parts:
   
   - Calculate the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction up to each day.
   - Calculate the maximum profit we can achieve with a second transaction starting from each day to the end.
   
   By combining these two parts, we can determine the maximum profit achievable with at most two transactions.

   We can use dynamic programming to keep track of these profits:
   
   - Use an array `left_profits` where `left_profits[i]` stores the maximum profit achievable from day 0 to day i with one transaction.
   - Use an array `right_profits` where `right_profits[i]` stores the maximum profit achievable from day i to the last day with one transaction.
   
   Finally, iterate through each day and calculate the total profit by summing `left_profits[i]` and `right_profits[i]`, and keep track of the maximum sum.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   If prices list is empty, return 0
   
   Initialize left_profits and right_profits arrays with zeros, same length as prices
   
   Initialize min_price to the first price
   For each day i from 1 to end:
       Update min_price to be the minimum of min_price and prices[i]
       Update left_profits[i] to be the maximum of left_profits[i-1] and prices[i] - min_price
   
   Initialize max_price to the last price
   For each day i from second last to start:
       Update max_price to be the maximum of max_price and prices[i]
       Update right_profits[i] to be the maximum of right_profits[i+1] and max_price - prices[i]
   
   Initialize max_profit to 0
   For each day i:
       Update max_profit to be the maximum of max_profit and left_profits[i] + right_profits[i]
   
   Return max_profit
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # If the prices list is empty, return 0 as no transactions can be made
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        n = len(prices)
        
        # Initialize arrays to store maximum profits for left and right transactions
        left_profits = [0] * n
        right_profits = [0] * n
        
        # Calculate maximum profit for one transaction from the left (start to each day)
        min_price = prices[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
            left_profits[i] = max(left_profits[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)
        
        # Calculate maximum profit for one transaction from the right (each day to end)
        max_price = prices[-1]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
            right_profits[i] = max(right_profits[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])
        
        # Calculate the maximum profit by combining left and right profits
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(n):
            max_profit = max(max_profit, left_profits[i] + right_profits[i])
        
        return max_profit
```

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit possible with at most two transactions by using dynamic programming to track potential profits from both directions (left to right and right to left).

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

    ### Summary of Problem-Solving Process

    The problem required maximizing the expression `A[d] - A[c] + A[b] - A[a]` with the constraint `d > c > b > a`. The challenge was to efficiently compute this maximum value given the constraints and the size of the input array.

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns

    - **Dynamic Programming**: The solution involved using dynamic programming to track the maximum possible values for each segment of the expression as we iterate through the array. This approach ensures that the constraints are respected and the expression is maximized.

    - **Iterative Backtracking**: By iterating through the array and maintaining running maximums for each part of the expression, we can efficiently compute the desired result without needing to check all possible combinations explicitly.

    #### Strategies and Fixes

    - **Initial Mistake**: The initial approach did not correctly handle the constraints and failed to track the necessary maximums for each segment of the expression. This led to incorrect results.

    - **Correct Approach**: By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using arrays to store intermediate maximum values (`max_a`, `max_b_minus_a`, `max_c_plus_b_minus_a`, `max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a`), the solution was able to correctly compute the maximum value of the expression.

    - **Input/Output Handling**: Ensuring that the input is read correctly from standard input and the result is printed to standard output was crucial for the solution to work in a competitive programming environment.

    #### Code Snippet

    Here's the final solution that correctly implements the logic:

    ```python
    def maximizeExpression(N, A):
        max_a = [0] * N
        max_b_minus_a = [0] * N
        max_c_plus_b_minus_a = [0] * N
        max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a = [0] * N

        max_a[0] = -A[0]
        for i in range(1, N):
            max_a[i] = max(max_a[i-1], -A[i])

        max_b_minus_a[1] = A[1] + max_a[0]
        for i in range(2, N):
            max_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_b_minus_a[i-1], A[i] + max_a[i-1])

        max_c_plus_b_minus_a[2] = -A[2] + max_b_minus_a[1]
        for i in range(3, N):
            max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1], -A[i] + max_b_minus_a[i-1])

        max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[3] = A[3] + max_c_plus_b_minus_a[2]
        for i in range(4, N):
            max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1], A[i] + max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1])

        return max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[N-1]

    # Read input from standard input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    N = int(data[0])
    A = list(map(int, data[1:]))

    result = maximizeExpression(N, A)
    print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down complex expressions into manageable parts and using dynamic programming to efficiently solve problems with constraints.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to maximize the number of chocolates Anushka could buy given a list of prices and a fixed budget. The core concept was to prioritize purchasing cheaper chocolates first to maximize the count, which is a classic example of a greedy algorithm.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Greedy Algorithm:** By sorting the prices in ascending order and purchasing the cheapest chocolates first, we ensure that we maximize the number of chocolates bought within the budget.
    - **Input/Output Handling:** The problem required reading from standard input and writing to standard output, which is common in competitive programming and coding interviews.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Sorting:** Sorting the list of prices was crucial to implementing the greedy approach effectively.
    - **Iterative Deduction:** Iterating through the sorted list and deducting each price from the budget until the budget could no longer cover the next chocolate was the main logic to solve the problem.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling:** Initially, the function was not called with the correct input format, which led to no output being detected. This was fixed by using `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then parsing it appropriately.
    - **Output:** Ensuring the result was printed to standard output was necessary for the solution to be evaluated correctly in the testing environment.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def maxChocolates(n, k, prices):
        prices.sort()
        count = 0
        for price in prices:
            if k >= price:
                k -= price
                count += 1
            else:
                break
        return count

    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    k = int(data[1])
    prices = list(map(int, data[2:]))
    result = maxChocolates(n, k, prices)
    print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of handling input/output correctly in coding challenges and the effectiveness of greedy algorithms in optimization problems.

    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

        Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a limited amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price. Given a list of chocolate prices and the total amount of money Anushka has, determine the maximum number of chocolates she can buy without exceeding her budget.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

        To maximize the number of chocolates Anushka can buy, she should start by purchasing the cheapest chocolates first. This way, she can buy more chocolates before her money runs out. The steps are:
        - Sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order.
        - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of chocolates bought.
        - Iterate through the sorted list, subtracting each chocolate's price from the total money Anushka has.
        - Stop when the next chocolate's price exceeds the remaining money.
        - The counter will then represent the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

        ```
        function maxChocolates(n, k, prices):
            sort prices in ascending order
            count = 0
            for each price in prices:
                if k >= price:
                    k = k - price
                    count = count + 1
                else:
                    break
            return count
        ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        def maxChocolates(n, k, prices):
            # Sort the prices in ascending order to buy cheaper chocolates first

            # Initialize a counter for the number of chocolates bought
            count = 0
    
            # Iterate over the sorted prices
            for price in prices:
                # Check if the current chocolate can be bought with the remaining money
                if k >= price:
                    # Deduct the price from the remaining money
                    k -= price
                    # Increment the count of chocolates bought
                    count += 1
                else:
                    # If the current chocolate cannot be bought, stop the process
                    break
    
            # Return the total number of chocolates bought
            return count
        ```

        This solution efficiently determines the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy by prioritizing cheaper chocolates, ensuring the budget is utilized optimally.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a list where each element represents the price of a stock on a particular day. We need to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying and then selling the stock. We cannot hold more than one stock at a time, meaning we must sell the stock before buying again.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum profit achievable with up to two transactions. We will maintain two arrays:
   - `first_buy_sell_profit`: This array will store the maximum profit achievable up to each day with one transaction.
   - `second_buy_sell_profit`: This array will store the maximum profit achievable up to each day with two transactions.

   The idea is to iterate through the list of prices twice:
   - In the first pass, calculate the maximum profit for each day if we were to make only one transaction.
   - In the second pass, calculate the maximum profit for each day if we were to make two transactions, using the results from the first pass.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function maxProfit(prices):
       if prices is empty:
           return 0

       n = length of prices
       first_buy_sell_profit = array of zeros with length n
       second_buy_sell_profit = array of zeros with length n

       # First pass: calculate max profit with one transaction
       min_price = prices[0]
       for i from 1 to n-1:
           min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
           first_buy_sell_profit[i] = max(first_buy_sell_profit[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)

       # Second pass: calculate max profit with two transactions
       max_price = prices[n-1]
       for i from n-2 to 0:
           max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
           second_buy_sell_profit[i] = max(second_buy_sell_profit[i+1], max_price - prices[i] + first_buy_sell_profit[i])

       return second_buy_sell_profit[0]
   ```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Â             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Â             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
Â             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:


Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the maximum profit from at most two stock transactions given a list of daily prices. The key concept here was to use dynamic programming to efficiently track the maximum profit achievable with one and two transactions.

The solution involved two main passes through the price list:
1. **First Pass:** Calculate the maximum profit possible with a single transaction up to each day. This was done by maintaining a running minimum price and updating the profit for each day based on the difference between the current price and this minimum.
2. **Second Pass:** Calculate the maximum profit possible with two transactions. This involved iterating from the end of the list to the beginning, maintaining a running maximum price, and updating the profit for each day by considering the potential profit from a second transaction combined with the best profit from the first pass.

The dynamic programming approach allowed us to efficiently compute the solution in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of days, by using two auxiliary arrays to store intermediate results.

This problem reinforced the importance of breaking down complex problems into smaller subproblems and using dynamic programming to store and reuse results, which is a common pattern in optimization problems. The solution was straightforward once the problem was decomposed into these two passes, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Â             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a list where each element represents the price of a stock on a particular day. We need to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying and then selling the stock. We cannot hold more than one stock at a time, meaning we must sell the stock before buying again.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum profit achievable with up to two transactions. We will maintain two arrays:
   - `first_buy_sell_profit`: This array will store the maximum profit achievable up to each day with one transaction.
   - `second_buy_sell_profit`: This array will store the maximum profit achievable up to each day with two transactions.

   The idea is to iterate through the list of prices twice:
   - In the first pass, calculate the maximum profit for each day if we were to make only one transaction.
   - In the second pass, calculate the maximum profit for each day if we were to make two transactions, using the results from the first pass.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```

            # Update the maximum price seen so far from the end
            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
            # Calculate the maximum profit for two transactions up to day i
            second_buy_sell_profit[i] = max(second_buy_sell_profit[i+1], max_price - prices[i] + first_buy_sell_profit[i])

        # The maximum profit with at most two transactions
        return second_buy_sell_profit[0]
```

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit by using dynamic programming to track the best possible outcomes for one and two transactions, iterating through the list of prices twice.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] The official solution provides an alternative approach to solving the problem of maximizing profit with at most two stock transactions. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Reverse Pass for Maximum Future Profit:**
   - The solution first calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved from any day `i` to the end of the list. This is stored in the `rmax_profits` array.
   - It iterates from the second last day to the first, updating the maximum price seen so far (`rmax`) and calculating the potential profit if sold on the current day. This helps in determining the best possible profit for the second transaction starting from any day.

2. **Forward Pass for Maximum Past Profit:**
   - The solution then calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved from the start of the list to any day `i`. This is done by keeping track of the minimum price seen so far (`lmin`) and calculating the potential profit if bought on the current day.
   - It also calculates the total profit by adding the maximum profit from the first transaction up to day `i` and the maximum profit from the second transaction starting from day `i+1`.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - The total maximum profit is updated by considering the sum of the best possible profits from both transactions at each day. This ensures that the solution considers the optimal points to buy and sell for both transactions.

The official solution is insightful as it effectively breaks down the problem into two passes over the data, each focusing on one aspect of the transaction (either buying or selling). This approach is efficient and clear, leveraging the idea of maintaining running maximums and minimums to calculate potential profits dynamically. This method is both time-efficient and space-efficient, using only linear time and space relative to the input size.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] The function calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved from at most two stock transactions given a list of daily stock prices. It first computes the maximum profit possible with a single transaction up to each day by iterating through the prices and keeping track of the minimum price encountered so far. Then, it calculates the maximum profit possible with two transactions by iterating backward through the prices, keeping track of the maximum price encountered from the end, and combining it with the previously computed single transaction profits. The result is the maximum profit achievable with at most two transactions, which is stored in the first element of the second profit array. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0.

[Problem]
    Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

    Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

    Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

    Example 1:


    Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
    Â             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

    Example 2:


    Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
    Â             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
    Â             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


    Example 3:


    Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
