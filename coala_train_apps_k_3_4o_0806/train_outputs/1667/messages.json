The depth is the number of runs, you have to do.\n- In every run you have to switch the direction. First run from left, next run from right. Next left...\nEvery run has these rules:\n- You start at the first number (from the direction).\n- Take for every number x the remainder of the division by the number of still available elements (from \n  this position!) to have the number for the next decision.\n- If the remainder-value is smaller than 3, take this number x (NOT the remainder-Value) direct\n  for the new array and continue with the next number.\n- If the remainder-value (e.g. 3) is greater than 2, take the next remainder-value-number (e.g. 3)\n  elements/numbers (inclusive the number x, NOT the remainder-value) as a sub-array in the new array.\n  Continue with the next number/element AFTER this taken elements/numbers.\n- Every sub-array in the array is independent and is only one element for the progress on the array. \n  For every sub-array you have to follow the same rules for unflatten it.\n  The direction is always the same as the actual run.\n```\n\nSounds complicated? Yeah, thats why, this is the harder version...\nMaybe an example will help.\n\n```\n Array: [4, 5, 1, 7, 1] Depth: 2 -> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n \nSteps: \nFirst run: (start from left side!)\n1. The first number is 4. The number is smaller than the number of remaining elements, so it is the remainder-value (4 / 5 -> remainder 4).\n   So 4 numbers (4, 5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the new array.\n2. The next number is 1. It is smaller than 3, so the 1 is added direct to the new array.\nNow we have --> [[4, 5, 1, 7], 1]\n\nSecond run: (start from right side!)\n1. The last number (first from other side) is 1. So the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n2. The next element is the sub-array. So we use the rules for this.\n2a.The last number is 7. There are 4 elements in the array. So for the next decision you have to\n   take the remainder from 7 / 4 -> 3. So 3 numbers (5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the \n   new array.\n2b.Now there is the 4 and only one element last in this array. 4 / 1 -> remainder 0. It is smaller\n   than 3. So the 4 is added direct to the new array.\nNow we have --> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n```\n\nThe given array will always contain numbers.

The unflattening process involves multiple runs, where each run alternates direction (left-to-right, then right-to-left, and so on). During each run, we decide whether to take a number as is or to create a sub-array based on the remainder of the division of the number by the count of remaining elements. This process is repeated for the specified depth.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize the Process**: Start with the given list and depth. The depth indicates how many times we need to process the list.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Depth**: For each depth level, alternate the direction of processing (left-to-right or right-to-left).\n\n3. **Process the List**:\n   - For each number in the list, calculate the remainder of the division of the number by the count of remaining elements.\n   - If the remainder is less than 3, add the number directly to the new list.\n   - If the remainder is 3 or more, create a sub-array with the number of elements equal to the remainder, starting from the current position, and add this sub-array to the new list.\n   - If a sub-array is encountered, process it recursively with the same rules.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: After processing for the given depth, return the final unflattened list.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n    for each level in depth:\n        if level is even:\n            process from left to right\n        else:\n            process from right to left\n        \n        initialize new_array as empty\n        while there are elements in flat_array:\n            calculate remainder = current_element % number_of_remaining_elements\n            if remainder < 3:\n                add current_element to new_array\n            else:\n                create sub_array with remainder elements\n                add sub_array to new_array\n                skip remainder elements in flat_array\n            if an element is a sub-array:\n                recursively unflatten the sub-array with depth - 1\n        set flat_array to new_array\n    return flat_array\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n    def process_array(array, direction):\n        new_array = []\n        i = 0\n        n = len(array)\n        \n        while i < n:\n            current_element = array[i]\n            remainder = current_element % (n - i)\n            \n            if remainder < 3:\n                new_array.append(current_element)\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                sub_array = array[i:i + remainder]\n                new_array.append(sub_array)\n                i += remainder\n        \n        return new_array\n    \n    for level in range(depth):\n        if level % 2 == 0:\n            # Process from left to right\n            flat_array = process_array(flat_array, 'left')\n        else:\n            # Process from right to left\n            flat_array = process_array(flat_array[::-1], 'right')[::-1]\n    \n    return flat_array\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **process_array**: This helper function processes the array in the specified direction.

The challenge was to efficiently handle the generation and sorting of subarray sums, especially given the constraints.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved a straightforward approach:\n    1. **Subarray Sum Generation:** Iterate over all possible starting points of subarrays and calculate the sum for each subarray ending at different points. This was done using a nested loop where the outer loop fixed the starting point and the inner loop extended the subarray to include more elements.\n    2. **Sorting and Range Sum Calculation:** Once all subarray sums were generated, they were sorted. The sum of the specified range was then calculated by simply summing the elements from the sorted list within the given indices.\n\n    The solution was efficient given the constraints, and the use of modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) ensured that the result remained within the limits of typical integer operations in Python. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and sorting, which are common in competitive programming and algorithmic challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem revolves around the ability to adjust a sequence of integers such that their sum becomes zero. The key operation allowed is to decrease an element `A[i]` by its index `i`. This means each element can be reduced by any multiple of its index, which introduces a degree of flexibility in adjusting the sequence.\n\n    #### Initial Missteps\n    Initially, I misinterpreted the problem by assuming that if the sum of the sequence was divisible by the sum of indices, then it could be made zero. This approach was flawed because it didn't account for the individual adjustments needed for each element. The logic was too simplistic and didn't consider the cumulative effect of the operations.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves simulating the process of adjusting each element by its index and ensuring that the cumulative effect can lead to a zero sum. The solution should:\n    - Calculate the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices.\n    - Check if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by iteratively applying the operations.\n    - Ensure that each element can be adjusted without going negative.\n\n    #### Lessons Learned\n    - **Divisibility is Not Enough**: Simply checking if the sum is divisible by the sum of indices is insufficient. The solution must consider the feasibility of adjustments for each element.\n    - **Iterative Simulation**: Simulating the process of adjustments is crucial to understanding whether the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n    - **Attention to Detail**: Ensuring that each element can be adjusted properly is key to solving the problem.\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the operations allowed and their implications on the sequence. It also reinforced the need to simulate processes rather than relying on simple mathematical checks.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum of a subsequence of Pok\u00e9mon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It calculates the remainder for each element and decides whether to add the element directly or form a sub-array. If a sub-array is formed, it recursively processes the sub-array.\n  \n- **unflatten**: This function manages the overall process, iterating over the specified depth and alternating the direction of processing. It uses the `process_list` function to transform the list at each depth level.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Recursive Processing**: The `process_list` function now correctly handles sub-arrays by recursively processing them, ensuring that each sub-array is treated independently.\n  \n- **Direction Management**: The function correctly handles the direction by reversing the list only when necessary and ensuring that sub-arrays are processed in the correct order.\n\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the transformed list after processing all depth levels, ensuring that the final result is correctly structured."

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum.

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, we were tasked with finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for paths in a tree structure. The core concepts involved were tree traversal, pathfinding, and dynamic programming for LIS calculation.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Strategies:\n    1. **Tree Representation**: We used an adjacency list to represent the tree, which is efficient for traversal operations like BFS or DFS.\n\n    2. **Pathfinding in Trees**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path between any two nodes is unique. We used BFS starting from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.\n\n    3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: We employed a dynamic programming approach with binary search to compute the LIS efficiently in `O(L log L)` time, where `L` is the length of the path.\n\n    ### Challenges and Solutions:\n    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the `solve()` function was called resolved this issue.\n    - **Output Format**: The problem required outputting the LIS length for each vertex path, which was correctly handled by printing each result on a new line.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_lis_length(sequence):\n        lis = []\n        for value in sequence:\n            low, high = 0, len(lis)\n            while low < high:\n                mid = (low + high) // 2\n                if lis[mid] < value:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid\n            if low == len(lis):\n                lis.append(value)\n            else:\n                lis[low] = value\n        return len(lis)\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        N = int(data[0])\n        a = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))\n        edges = list(zip(map(int, data[N+1::2]), map(int, data[N+2::2])))\n    \n        from collections import defaultdict, deque\n        tree = defaultdict(list)\n        for u, v in edges:\n            tree[u].append(v)\n            tree[v].append(u)\n    \n        parent = {1: None}\n        queue = deque([1])\n        paths = {1: [1]}\n    \n        while queue:\n            node = queue.popleft()\n            for neighbor in tree[node]:\n                if neighbor not in parent:\n                    parent[neighbor] = node\n                    queue.append(neighbor)\n                    paths[neighbor] = paths[node] + [neighbor]\n    \n        results = []\n        for k in range(1, N + 1):\n            path = paths[k]\n            sequence = [a[i - 1] for i in path]\n            lis_length = find_lis_length(sequence)\n            results.append(lis_length)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly handling input/output in competitive programming and the efficiency of using binary search for LIS problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Process\n\n    The problem involved handling scrambled team names and aggregating scores, which required careful attention to detail in both the logic and implementation. Here are some key insights and learnings from the process:\n\n    1. **Normalization of Team Names**: The core challenge was to handle scrambled team names. The solution involved normalizing team names by sorting their characters. This approach ensured that all variations of a team name were treated as the same entity, which was crucial for accurate score aggregation.\n\n    2. **Score Aggregation**: A dictionary was used to map normalized team names to their cumulative scores. This allowed for efficient updating and retrieval of scores, ensuring that all submissions for a team were correctly summed.\n\n    3. **Sorting Logic**: The requirement to sort teams by score in descending order and by name lexicographically when scores were tied was handled using a custom sorting function. This involved creating tuples that included both the score and the original team name, allowing for straightforward sorting using Python's built-in capabilities.\n\n    4. **Efficient Input Handling**: Given the constraints, efficient input handling was necessary. Using `sys.stdin.read` for bulk input reading and processing it line by line helped manage large datasets effectively.\n\n    5. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the output matched the expected format was critical. This involved careful handling of spaces and line breaks, which can often be a source of errors in competitive programming.\n\n    ### Comparison with the Official Solution\n\n    The official solution provided a different perspective on handling the problem:\n\n    - **Use of Large Numbers for Sorting**: The official solution used a clever trick of subtracting scores from a large number (`10**10`) to facilitate sorting by score in descending order. This approach is both efficient and elegant, as it leverages Python's ability to handle large integers seamlessly.\n\n    - **Direct Comparison with Sorted Names**: Instead of maintaining a separate dictionary for scores, the official solution directly compared sorted team names to update scores. This approach simplifies the logic and reduces the need for additional data structures.\n\n    Overall, the official solution offered a more concise and potentially more efficient approach, particularly in how it handled sorting and score aggregation. This experience highlighted the importance of exploring different strategies and leveraging Python's strengths in handling large numbers and sorting.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
