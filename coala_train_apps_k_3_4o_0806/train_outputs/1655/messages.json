The key concept is to strategically color intervals to ensure maximum overlap, which requires understanding and managing interval overlaps effectively.\n\n    #### Initial Strategy and Its Flaws\n    The initial approach was to alternate colors between intervals, assuming this would naturally lead to maximum overlap. This strategy failed because it did not account for the specific overlaps between intervals. Simply alternating colors does not guarantee that overlapping intervals will be colored differently, which is necessary for maximizing the green area.\n\n    #### Effective Strategy\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. **Sorting Intervals**: Sorting intervals by their starting points to facilitate efficient overlap checking.\n    2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**: Using a greedy approach to color intervals based on their overlap with previously colored intervals. This involved maintaining the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals and choosing the color that maximizes overlap with these.\n\n    #### Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for intervals in test_cases:\n            intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n            result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n            last_blue_end = -1\n            last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n            for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n                if L <= last_blue_end:\n                    result[index] = '1'\n                    last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)\n                else:\n                    result[index] = '0'\n                    last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)\n        \n            results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n    ```\n\n    #### Lessons Learned\n    - **Importance of Overlap Management**: The problem highlighted the importance of managing overlaps in interval problems, which is a common theme in computational geometry and scheduling problems.\n    - **Greedy Algorithms**: A greedy approach, when combined with strategic decision-making based on problem-specific constraints, can be very effective.\n    - **Iterative Refinement**: The process of refining the solution based on feedback and testing different strategies was crucial in arriving at the correct solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:\n        - White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval\n        - Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.\n        - Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.\n        - Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.\n        You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n        - The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.\n        - The $i^{\\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $ 1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5 $\n        - $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $\n        - The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n        - $ 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\n        -----Sample Input:-----\n        1\n        3\n        3 7\n        2 5\n        6 9\n\n        -----Sample Output:-----\n        100\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:\n        - $[2, 3) \\cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.\n        - $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.\n        - $[3, 5] \\cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.\n        - Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.\n        Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.\n        Note that 011 is also a valid output.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        ### Analysis of the Issue\n\n        The current approach uses a simple alternating coloring strategy, which doesn't necessarily maximize the green area. The problem lies in the assumption that alternating colors will always lead to maximum overlap, which is not true for all cases. The intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps rather than just alternating colors.\n\n        ### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n        1. **Assumption of Alternating Colors**: The solution assumed that simply alternating colors would maximize the green area.

If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

Specifically, the issue seems to be with the format of the output list, particularly the last element which should be a list of colors followed by the maximum number of triangles. Let's break down the issues:\n\n1. **Output Format**: The expected output format for the last element is a list containing the colors with the maximum number of triangles, followed by the count of those triangles. My current implementation outputs a nested list for the colors, which is incorrect.\n\n2. **Handling of Zero Triangles**: When there are no triangles, the expected output is an empty list for the colors. My implementation seems to be outputting all colors with a count of zero, which is incorrect.\n\n### Steps to Correct the Code\n\n1. **Flatten the Color List**: Ensure that the list of colors with the maximum number of triangles is not nested. It should be a flat list.\n\n2. **Handle Zero Triangles**: If no triangles are formed, the list of colors should be empty, not a list of all colors.\n\n3. **Review Logic for Maximum Triangles**: Ensure that the logic for determining the maximum number of triangles and the corresponding colors is correct.\n\n### Revised Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_col_triang(points):\n    color_groups = group points by color\n    total_points = length of points\n    total_colors = length of color_groups\n    total_triangles = 0\n    max_triangles = 0\n    max_color = []\n\n    for each color in color_groups:\n        points_of_color = color_groups[color]\n        num_points = length of points_of_color\n        triangles = 0\n\n        for each combination of 3 points in points_of_color:\n            if not are_collinear(points):\n                triangles += 1\n\n        total_triangles += triangles\n\n        if triangles > max_triangles:\n            max_triangles = triangles\n            max_color = [color]\n        elif triangles == max_triangles:\n            max_color.append(color)\n\n    if max_triangles == 0:\n        max_color = []\n\n    return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, [sorted max_color, max_triangles]]\n```\n\n### Revised Python Code\n\n```python\ndef are_collinear(p1, p2, p3):\n    # Calculate the determinant to check if points are collinear\n    x1, y1 = p1\n    x2, y2 = p2\n    x3, y3 = p3\n    return (x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)) == 0\n\ndef count_col_triang(points):\n    from itertools import combinations\n    \n    # Group points by color\n    color_groups = {}\n    for point, color in points:\n        if color not in color_groups:\n            color_groups[color] = []\n        color_groups[color].append(point)\n    \n    total_points = len(points)\n    total_colors = len(color_groups)\n    total_triangles = 0\n    max_triangles = 0\n    max_color = []\n\n    # Calculate triangles for each color\n    for color, points_of_color in color_groups.items():\n        num_points = len(points_of_color)\n        triangles = 0\n\n        # Check all combinations of 3 points\n        for p1, p2, p3 in combinations(points_of_color, 3):\n            if not are_collinear(p1, p2, p3):\n                triangles += 1\n\n        total_triangles += triangles\n\n        # Determine if this color has the maximum number of triangles\n        if triangles > max_triangles:\n            max_triangles = triangles\n            max_color = [color]\n        elif triangles == max_triangles:\n            max_color.append(color)\n\n    # Sort colors with the maximum number of triangles\n    max_color.sort()\n\n    # If no triangles are formed, max_color should be an empty list\n    if max_triangles == 0:\n        max_color = []\n\n    return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, [max_color, max_triangles]]\n```\n\nThis revised code should correctly handle the output format and the case where no triangles are formed."

The key concept is to strategically color intervals to ensure maximum overlap, which requires understanding and managing interval overlaps effectively.\n\n    #### Initial Strategy and Its Flaws\n    The initial approach was to alternate colors between intervals, assuming this would naturally lead to maximum overlap. This strategy failed because it did not account for the specific overlaps between intervals. Simply alternating colors does not guarantee that overlapping intervals will be colored differently, which is necessary for maximizing the green area.\n\n    #### Effective Strategy\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. **Sorting Intervals**: Sorting intervals by their starting points to facilitate efficient overlap checking.\n    2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**: Using a greedy approach to color intervals based on their overlap with previously colored intervals. This involved maintaining the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals and choosing the color that maximizes overlap with these.\n\n    #### Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for intervals in test_cases:\n            intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n            result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n            last_blue_end = -1\n            last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n            for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n                if L <= last_blue_end:\n                    result[index] = '1'\n                    last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)\n                else:\n                    result[index] = '0'\n                    last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)\n        \n            results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n    ```\n\n    #### Lessons Learned\n    - **Importance of Overlap Management**: The problem highlighted the importance of managing overlaps in interval problems, which is a common theme in computational geometry and scheduling problems.\n    - **Greedy Algorithms**: A greedy approach, when combined with strategic decision-making based on problem-specific constraints, can be very effective.\n    - **Iterative Refinement**: The process of refining the solution based on feedback and testing different strategies was crucial in arriving at the correct solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem requires distributing ducks into boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors. This constraint was not fully respected in my initial attempts, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    2. **Greedy Approach**: The official solution uses a greedy approach, which is effective for this problem. It prioritizes filling boxes with the most available color and then uses the next available color to fill any remaining space. This ensures that each box is filled optimally with respect to the constraints.\n\n    3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes specific handling for edge cases, such as when `n=2` and `k=5`. This highlights the importance of considering special cases that might not be immediately obvious but are crucial for passing all test cases.\n\n    4. **Efficient Use of Data Structures**: The use of dictionaries in the official solution to map original indices after sorting is a clever way to maintain the original color indices, which is necessary for correct output formatting.\n\n    5. **Iterative Box Filling**: The solution iteratively fills each box, updating the count of ducks for each color and moving to the next color when necessary. This iterative process ensures that all ducks are distributed correctly across the boxes.\n\n    In summary, the official solution provides a robust and efficient way to solve the problem by leveraging a greedy strategy, careful handling of edge cases, and efficient data management. These insights can be valuable for tackling similar problems in the future, where constraints and optimal distribution are key factors.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:\n        - White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval\n        - Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.\n        - Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.\n        - Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.\n        You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n        - The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.\n        - The $i^{\\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $ 1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5 $\n        - $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $\n        - The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n        - $ 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\n        -----Sample Input:-----\n        1\n        3\n        3 7\n        2 5\n        6 9\n\n        -----Sample Output:-----\n        100\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:\n        - $[2, 3) \\cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.\n        - $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.\n        - $[3, 5] \\cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.\n        - Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.\n        Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.\n        Note that 011 is also a valid output.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        ### Analysis of the Issue\n\n        The current approach uses a simple alternating coloring strategy, which doesn't necessarily maximize the green area. The problem lies in the assumption that alternating colors will always lead to maximum overlap, which is not true for all cases. The intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps rather than just alternating colors.\n\n        ### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n        1. **Assumption of Alternating Colors**: The solution assumed that simply alternating colors would maximize the green area. This is incorrect because the intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps.\n\n        2. **Overlap Handling**: The solution did not correctly handle cases where multiple intervals overlap in a way that requires more strategic coloring to maximize the green area.\n\n        3. **Coloring Logic**: The logic for determining when to switch colors was too simplistic and did not account for the actual overlap lengths.\n\n        ### Revised Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Sort Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points.\n\n        2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**:\n           - Use a greedy approach to color intervals, but with a focus on maximizing overlap.\n           - Track the end of the last interval that was colored blue and yellow.\n           - For each interval, decide its color based on which color will maximize the overlap with previously colored intervals.\n\n        3. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).\n\n        ### Revised Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                intervals = test_case\n                sort intervals by starting point L_i\n                result = []\n                last_blue_end = -1\n                last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n                for each interval in intervals:\n                    if it overlaps more with blue:\n                        color it yellow\n                        update last_yellow_end\n                    else:\n                        color it blue\n                        update last_blue_end\n                    add the color to the result\n        \n                print the result as a string\n        ```\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for intervals in test_cases:\n                # Sort intervals by their starting point\n                intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n                result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n                last_blue_end = -1\n                last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n                for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n                    # Determine which color maximizes overlap\n                    if L <= last_blue_end:\n                        # If it overlaps with the last blue, color it yellow\n                        result[index] = '1'\n                        last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)\n                    else:\n                        # Otherwise, color it blue\n                        result[index] = '0'\n                        last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)\n        \n                results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n            for res in results:\n                print(res)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                n = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                intervals = []\n                for _ in range(n):\n                    L, R = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n                    intervals.append((L, R))\n                    index += 2\n                test_cases.append(intervals)\n    \n            maximize_green(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their starting points to facilitate checking for overlaps.\n        - **Coloring Strategy**: The intervals are colored based on which color will maximize the overlap with previously colored intervals.\n        - **Output**: The result for each test case is a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        To address the issue with the previous solution, we need to focus on maximizing the overlap between intervals by strategically coloring them.

Specifically, the last element of the result list should be an empty list when there are no triangles, but the current implementation outputs `[0]`.\n\n### Where the Code Went Wrong\n\n1. **Handling Zero Triangles**: The logic for handling the case where no triangles are formed is incorrect. The code currently appends `max_triangles` to `max_color`, which results in `[0]` when `max_triangles` is zero. Instead, the entire last element should be an empty list if no triangles are formed.\n\n2. **Output Construction**: The construction of the output list needs to be adjusted to handle the zero-triangle case correctly.\n\n### Steps to Correct the Code\n\n1. **Check for Zero Triangles**: Before constructing the final output, check if `max_triangles` is zero. If it is, set the last element of the result to an empty list.\n\n2. **Adjust Output Construction**: Ensure that the output list is constructed correctly based on whether any triangles are formed.\n\n### Revised Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_col_triang(points):\n    color_groups = group points by color\n    total_points = length of points\n    total_colors = length of color_groups\n    total_triangles = 0\n    max_triangles = 0\n    max_color = []\n\n    for each color in color_groups:\n        points_of_color = color_groups[color]\n        num_points = length of points_of_color\n        triangles = 0\n\n        for each combination of 3 points in points_of_color:\n            if not are_collinear(points):\n                triangles += 1\n\n        total_triangles += triangles\n\n        if triangles > max_triangles:\n            max_triangles = triangles\n            max_color = [color]\n        elif triangles == max_triangles:\n            max_color.append(color)\n\n    if max_triangles == 0:\n        return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, []]\n\n    return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, [sorted max_color, max_triangles]]\n```\n\n### Revised Python Code\n\n```python\ndef are_collinear(p1, p2, p3):\n    # Calculate the determinant to check if points are collinear\n    x1, y1 = p1\n    x2, y2 = p2\n    x3, y3 = p3\n    return (x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)) == 0\n\ndef count_col_triang(points):\n    from itertools import combinations\n    \n    # Group points by color\n    color_groups = {}\n    for point, color in points:\n        if color not in color_groups:\n            color_groups[color] = []\n        color_groups[color].append(point)\n    \n    total_points = len(points)\n    total_colors = len(color_groups)\n    total_triangles = 0\n    max_triangles = 0\n    max_color = []\n\n    # Calculate triangles for each color\n    for color, points_of_color in color_groups.items():\n        num_points = len(points_of_color)\n        triangles = 0\n\n        # Check all combinations of 3 points\n        for p1, p2, p3 in combinations(points_of_color, 3):\n            if not are_collinear(p1, p2, p3):\n                triangles += 1\n\n        total_triangles += triangles\n\n        # Determine if this color has the maximum number of triangles\n        if triangles > max_triangles:\n            max_triangles = triangles\n            max_color = [color]\n        elif triangles == max_triangles:\n            max_color.append(color)\n\n    # Sort colors with the maximum number of triangles\n    max_color.sort()\n\n    # If no triangles are formed, return an empty list for colors\n    if max_triangles == 0:\n        return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, []]\n\n    return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, max_color + [max_triangles]]\n```\n\nThis revised code should correctly handle the case where no triangles are formed and produce the expected output format."

Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:\n        - White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval\n        - Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.\n        - Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.\n        - Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.\n        You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n        - The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.\n        - The $i^{\\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $ 1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5 $\n        - $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $\n        - The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n        - $ 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\n        -----Sample Input:-----\n        1\n        3\n        3 7\n        2 5\n        6 9\n\n        -----Sample Output:-----\n        100\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$.

The problem lies in the assumption that alternating colors will always lead to maximum overlap, which is not true for all cases. The intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps rather than just alternating colors.\n\n        ### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n        1. **Assumption of Alternating Colors**: The solution assumed that simply alternating colors would maximize the green area. This is incorrect because the intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps.\n\n        2. **Overlap Handling**: The solution did not correctly handle cases where multiple intervals overlap in a way that requires more strategic coloring to maximize the green area.\n\n        3. **Coloring Logic**: The logic for determining when to switch colors was too simplistic and did not account for the actual overlap lengths.\n\n        ### Revised Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Sort Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points.\n\n        2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**:\n           - Use a greedy approach to color intervals, but with a focus on maximizing overlap.\n           - Track the end of the last interval that was colored blue and yellow.\n           - For each interval, decide its color based on which color will maximize the overlap with previously colored intervals.\n\n        3. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).\n\n        ### Revised Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                intervals = test_case\n                sort intervals by starting point L_i\n                result = []\n                last_blue_end = -1\n                last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n                for each interval in intervals:\n                    if it overlaps more with blue:\n                        color it yellow\n                        update last_yellow_end\n                    else:\n                        color it blue\n                        update last_blue_end\n                    add the color to the result\n        \n                print the result as a string\n        ```\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for intervals in test_cases:\n                # Sort intervals by their starting point\n                intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n                result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n                last_blue_end = -1\n                last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n                for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n                    # Determine which color maximizes overlap\n                    if L <= last_blue_end:\n                        # If it overlaps with the last blue, color it yellow\n                        result[index] = '1'\n                        last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)\n                    else:\n                        # Otherwise, color it blue\n                        result[index] = '0'\n                        last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)\n        \n                results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n            for res in results:\n                print(res)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                n = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                intervals = []\n                for _ in range(n):\n                    L, R = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n                    intervals.append((L, R))\n                    index += 2\n                test_cases.append(intervals)\n    \n            maximize_green(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their starting points to facilitate checking for overlaps.\n        - **Coloring Strategy**: The intervals are colored based on which color will maximize the overlap with previously colored intervals.\n        - **Output**: The result for each test case is a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        To address the issue with the previous solution, we need to focus on maximizing the overlap between intervals by strategically coloring them.

The key concept is to strategically color intervals to ensure maximum overlap, which requires understanding and managing interval overlaps effectively.\n\n    #### Initial Strategy and Its Flaws\n    The initial approach was to alternate colors between intervals, assuming this would naturally lead to maximum overlap. This strategy failed because it did not account for the specific overlaps between intervals. Simply alternating colors does not guarantee that overlapping intervals will be colored differently, which is necessary for maximizing the green area.\n\n    #### Effective Strategy\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. **Sorting Intervals**: Sorting intervals by their starting points to facilitate efficient overlap checking.\n    2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**: Using a greedy approach to color intervals based on their overlap with previously colored intervals. This involved maintaining the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals and choosing the color that maximizes overlap with these.\n\n    #### Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for intervals in test_cases:\n            intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n            result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n            last_blue_end = -1\n            last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n            for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n                if L <= last_blue_end:\n                    result[index] = '1'\n                    last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)\n                else:\n                    result[index] = '0'\n                    last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)\n        \n            results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n    ```\n\n    #### Lessons Learned\n    - **Importance of Overlap Management**: The problem highlighted the importance of managing overlaps in interval problems, which is a common theme in computational geometry and scheduling problems.\n    - **Greedy Algorithms**: A greedy approach, when combined with strategic decision-making based on problem-specific constraints, can be very effective.\n    - **Iterative Refinement**: The process of refining the solution based on feedback and testing different strategies was crucial in arriving at the correct solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:\n        - White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval\n        - Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.\n        - Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.\n        - Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.\n        You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n        - The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.\n        - The $i^{\\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $ 1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5 $\n        - $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $\n        - The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n        - $ 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\n        -----Sample Input:-----\n        1\n        3\n        3 7\n        2 5\n        6 9\n\n        -----Sample Output:-----\n        100\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:\n        - $[2, 3) \\cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.\n        - $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.\n        - $[3, 5] \\cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.\n        - Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.\n        Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.\n        Note that 011 is also a valid output.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ### Problem Restatement\n\n        You are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Each interval can be colored either blue or yellow. The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs where blue and yellow intervals overlap. You need to determine a coloring strategy for each interval to achieve this.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green area is formed by overlapping blue and yellow intervals. To maximize the green area, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible.\n\n        2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.\n\n        3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color intervals:\n           - Alternate the coloring of intervals as you iterate through the sorted list. This ensures that consecutive intervals have a high chance of overlapping, thus maximizing the green area.\n           - If an interval overlaps with the previous one, color it with the opposite color to ensure overlap.\n\n        4. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                intervals = test_case\n                sort intervals by starting point L_i\n                result = []\n                current_color = 0  # Start with blue (0)\n        \n                for each interval in intervals:\n                    if it overlaps with the previous interval:\n                        color it with the opposite color\n                    else:\n                        color it with the current color\n                    add the color to the result\n                    toggle the current color for the next interval\n        \n                print the result as a string\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for intervals in test_cases:\n                # Sort intervals by their starting point\n                intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n                result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n                current_color = 0  # Start with blue (0)\n        \n                for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n                    if i > 0:\n                        # Check overlap with the previous interval\n                        _, (prev_L, prev_R) = intervals[i - 1]\n                        if L <= prev_R:\n                            # If overlapping, use the opposite color\n                            current_color = 1 - current_color\n                    result[index] = str(current_color)\n                    # Toggle color for the next interval\n                    current_color = 1 - current_color\n        \n                results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n            for res in results:\n                print(res)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                n = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                intervals = []\n                for _ in range(n):\n                    L, R = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n                    intervals.append((L, R))\n                    index += 2\n                test_cases.append(intervals)\n    \n            maximize_green(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their starting points to facilitate checking for overlaps.\n        - **Coloring Strategy**: The intervals are colored alternately, and if an overlap is detected with the previous interval, the color is toggled to ensure overlap.\n        - **Output**: The result for each test case is a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['1', '3', '3 7', '2 5', '6 9'] Expected output: [{'100'}] # Execution output: ['000']\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Failure\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
