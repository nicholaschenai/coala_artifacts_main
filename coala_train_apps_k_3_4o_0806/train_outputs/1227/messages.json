For each test case, we are given the colors of the six sides in a specific order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. We need to determine if there are three sides that are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color. If such a set of sides exists, we output \"YES\"; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the sets of three adjacent sides on a cube. The cube has the following sets of three adjacent sides:\n1. Front, Left, Top\n2. Front, Right, Top\n3. Front, Left, Bottom\n4. Front, Right, Bottom\n5. Back, Left, Top\n6. Back, Right, Top\n7. Back, Left, Bottom\n8. Back, Right, Bottom\n\nFor each test case, we will check these sets to see if any of them have the same color on all three sides. If we find such a set, we output \"YES\"; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the number of test cases, T.\n2.

The key challenge was ensuring the output format was correct, especially when no triangles could be formed.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Grouping by Color**: The problem required grouping points by their color to calculate potential triangles for each color group.\n    - **Combination and Collinearity Check**: For each color group, I needed to check all combinations of three points and determine if they were collinear using a determinant method.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n    - **Output Format**: Initially, the output format was incorrect when no triangles were formed. The solution was to ensure that the last element of the result list was an empty list in such cases.\n    - **Handling Edge Cases**: The main edge case was when no triangles could be formed. The solution involved checking if the maximum number of triangles was zero and adjusting the output accordingly.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The final solution involved checking combinations of points for collinearity and correctly formatting the output:\n\n    ```python\n    def are_collinear(p1, p2, p3):\n        x1, y1 = p1\n        x2, y2 = p2\n        x3, y3 = p3\n        return (x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)) == 0\n\n    def count_col_triang(points):\n        from itertools import combinations\n    \n        color_groups = {}\n        for point, color in points:\n            if color not in color_groups:\n                color_groups[color] = []\n            color_groups[color].append(point)\n    \n        total_points = len(points)\n        total_colors = len(color_groups)\n        total_triangles = 0\n        max_triangles = 0\n        max_color = []\n\n        for color, points_of_color in color_groups.items():\n            triangles = 0\n            for p1, p2, p3 in combinations(points_of_color, 3):\n                if not are_collinear(p1, p2, p3):\n                    triangles += 1\n\n            total_triangles += triangles\n\n            if triangles > max_triangles:\n                max_triangles = triangles\n                max_color = [color]\n            elif triangles == max_triangles:\n                max_color.append(color)\n\n        max_color.sort()\n\n        if max_triangles == 0:\n            return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, []]\n\n        return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, max_color + [max_triangles]]\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of handling edge cases and ensuring the output format matches the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for counting triangles with vertices of the same color, I learned several key insights:\n\n    1. **Grouping by Color**: Both my solution and the official solution effectively grouped points by color, which is crucial for calculating triangles within each color group. This step simplifies the problem by reducing it to smaller subproblems.\n\n    2. **Triangle Validation**: The official solution uses a different method to check if three points form a triangle. It calculates the side lengths and uses Heron's formula to compute the area, ensuring it's greater than zero. This approach is robust and avoids potential pitfalls with floating-point arithmetic when checking collinearity using determinants.\n\n    3. **Handling Zero Triangles**: The official solution elegantly handles the case where no triangles are formed by checking if the maximum number of triangles (`mx`) is zero and adjusting the output accordingly. This was a point of failure in my initial attempts, where I struggled with the correct output format for zero triangles.\n\n    4. **Output Construction**: The official solution constructs the output in a concise manner, using list comprehensions and conditional expressions to handle different cases. This approach is both efficient and readable.\n\n    Overall, the official solution provided a more robust method for triangle validation and a cleaner approach to constructing the output. These insights can be applied to similar problems involving geometric computations and combinatorial counting.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts on Interval Coloring Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem revolves around maximizing the overlap (green area) between intervals on the X-axis by coloring them either blue or yellow. The key concept is to strategically color intervals to ensure maximum overlap, which requires understanding and managing interval overlaps effectively.\n\n    #### Initial Strategy and Its Flaws\n    The initial approach was to alternate colors between intervals, assuming this would naturally lead to maximum overlap. This strategy failed because it did not account for the specific overlaps between intervals. Simply alternating colors does not guarantee that overlapping intervals will be colored differently, which is necessary for maximizing the green area.\n\n    #### Effective Strategy\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. **Sorting Intervals**: Sorting intervals by their starting points to facilitate efficient overlap checking.\n    2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**: Using a greedy approach to color intervals based on their overlap with previously colored intervals. This involved maintaining the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals and choosing the color that maximizes overlap with these.\n\n    #### Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for intervals in test_cases:\n            intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n            result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n            last_blue_end = -1\n            last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n            for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n                if L <= last_blue_end:\n                    result[index] = '1'\n                    last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)\n                else:\n                    result[index] = '0'\n                    last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)\n        \n            results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n    ```\n\n    #### Lessons Learned\n    - **Importance of Overlap Management**: The problem highlighted the importance of managing overlaps in interval problems, which is a common theme in computational geometry and scheduling problems.\n    - **Greedy Algorithms**: A greedy approach, when combined with strategic decision-making based on problem-specific constraints, can be very effective.\n    - **Iterative Refinement**: The process of refining the solution based on feedback and testing different strategies was crucial in arriving at the correct solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
