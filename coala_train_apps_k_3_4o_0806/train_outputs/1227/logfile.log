INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a cube with each of its six sides painted in one of six possible colors: black, blue, red, green, yellow, or orange. For each test case, we are given the colors of the six sides in a specific order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. We need to determine if there are three sides that are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color. If such a set of sides exists, we output "YES"; otherwise, we output "NO".

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to identify the sets of three adjacent sides on a cube. The cube has the following sets of three adjacent sides:
1. Front, Left, Top
2. Front, Right, Top
3. Front, Left, Bottom
4. Front, Right, Bottom
5. Back, Left, Top
6. Back, Right, Top
7. Back, Left, Bottom
8. Back, Right, Bottom

For each test case, we will check these sets to see if any of them have the same color on all three sides. If we find such a set, we output "YES"; otherwise, we output "NO".

## Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases, T.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the six colors in the order: front, back, left, right, top, bottom.
   - Check the following sets of three adjacent sides:
     - (front, left, top)
     - (front, right, top)
     - (front, left, bottom)
     - (front, right, bottom)
     - (back, left, top)
     - (back, right, top)
     - (back, left, bottom)
     - (back, right, bottom)
   - If any of these sets have the same color on all three sides, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

## Python Solution

```python
def check_adjacent_sides(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        front, back, left, right, top, bottom = case
        
        # Check all possible sets of three adjacent sides
        if (front == left == top) or (front == right == top) or \
           (front == left == bottom) or (front == right == bottom) or \
           (back == left == top) or (back == right == top) or \
           (back == left == bottom) or (back == right == bottom):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [line.split() for line in data[1:T+1]]

# Get results
results = check_adjacent_sides(T, test_cases)

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This code reads the input, processes each test case to check for three adjacent sides with the same color, and outputs "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I was tasked with counting the number of triangles that can be formed from a set of lattice points, where all vertices of the triangle have the same color. The key challenge was ensuring the output format was correct, especially when no triangles could be formed.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Grouping by Color**: The problem required grouping points by their color to calculate potential triangles for each color group.
    - **Combination and Collinearity Check**: For each color group, I needed to check all combinations of three points and determine if they were collinear using a determinant method.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Output Format**: Initially, the output format was incorrect when no triangles were formed. The solution was to ensure that the last element of the result list was an empty list in such cases.
    - **Handling Edge Cases**: The main edge case was when no triangles could be formed. The solution involved checking if the maximum number of triangles was zero and adjusting the output accordingly.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved checking combinations of points for collinearity and correctly formatting the output:

    ```python
    def are_collinear(p1, p2, p3):
        x1, y1 = p1
        x2, y2 = p2
        x3, y3 = p3
        return (x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)) == 0

    def count_col_triang(points):
        from itertools import combinations
    
        color_groups = {}
        for point, color in points:
            if color not in color_groups:
                color_groups[color] = []
            color_groups[color].append(point)
    
        total_points = len(points)
        total_colors = len(color_groups)
        total_triangles = 0
        max_triangles = 0
        max_color = []

        for color, points_of_color in color_groups.items():
            triangles = 0
            for p1, p2, p3 in combinations(points_of_color, 3):
                if not are_collinear(p1, p2, p3):
                    triangles += 1

            total_triangles += triangles

            if triangles > max_triangles:
                max_triangles = triangles
                max_color = [color]
            elif triangles == max_triangles:
                max_color.append(color)

        max_color.sort()

        if max_triangles == 0:
            return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, []]

        return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, max_color + [max_triangles]]
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of handling edge cases and ensuring the output format matches the problem's requirements.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for counting triangles with vertices of the same color, I learned several key insights:

    1. **Grouping by Color**: Both my solution and the official solution effectively grouped points by color, which is crucial for calculating triangles within each color group. This step simplifies the problem by reducing it to smaller subproblems.

    2. **Triangle Validation**: The official solution uses a different method to check if three points form a triangle. It calculates the side lengths and uses Heron's formula to compute the area, ensuring it's greater than zero. This approach is robust and avoids potential pitfalls with floating-point arithmetic when checking collinearity using determinants.

    3. **Handling Zero Triangles**: The official solution elegantly handles the case where no triangles are formed by checking if the maximum number of triangles (`mx`) is zero and adjusting the output accordingly. This was a point of failure in my initial attempts, where I struggled with the correct output format for zero triangles.

    4. **Output Construction**: The official solution constructs the output in a concise manner, using list comprehensions and conditional expressions to handle different cases. This approach is both efficient and readable.

    Overall, the official solution provided a more robust method for triangle validation and a cleaner approach to constructing the output. These insights can be applied to similar problems involving geometric computations and combinatorial counting.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts on Interval Coloring Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing the overlap (green area) between intervals on the X-axis by coloring them either blue or yellow. The key concept is to strategically color intervals to ensure maximum overlap, which requires understanding and managing interval overlaps effectively.

    #### Initial Strategy and Its Flaws
    The initial approach was to alternate colors between intervals, assuming this would naturally lead to maximum overlap. This strategy failed because it did not account for the specific overlaps between intervals. Simply alternating colors does not guarantee that overlapping intervals will be colored differently, which is necessary for maximizing the green area.

    #### Effective Strategy
    The successful strategy involved:
    1. **Sorting Intervals**: Sorting intervals by their starting points to facilitate efficient overlap checking.
    2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**: Using a greedy approach to color intervals based on their overlap with previously colored intervals. This involved maintaining the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals and choosing the color that maximizes overlap with these.

    #### Code Snippet
    ```python
    def maximize_green(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for intervals in test_cases:
            intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])
            result = ['0'] * len(intervals)
            last_blue_end = -1
            last_yellow_end = -1
        
            for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):
                if L <= last_blue_end:
                    result[index] = '1'
                    last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)
                else:
                    result[index] = '0'
                    last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)
        
            results.append(''.join(result))
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)
    ```

    #### Lessons Learned
    - **Importance of Overlap Management**: The problem highlighted the importance of managing overlaps in interval problems, which is a common theme in computational geometry and scheduling problems.
    - **Greedy Algorithms**: A greedy approach, when combined with strategic decision-making based on problem-specific constraints, can be very effective.
    - **Iterative Refinement**: The process of refining the solution based on feedback and testing different strategies was crucial in arriving at the correct solution.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a cube with six sides, each painted in one of six possible colors: black, blue, red, green, yellow, or orange. For multiple test cases, we need to determine if there are three sides of the cube that are adjacent to each other and painted the same color. The sides are given in the order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to check specific sets of three sides that are adjacent on a cube. The possible sets of three adjacent sides are:
   - Front, Left, Top
   - Front, Right, Top
   - Back, Left, Bottom
   - Back, Right, Bottom
   - Left, Top, Back
   - Right, Top, Back
   - Left, Bottom, Front
   - Right, Bottom, Front

   For each test case, we will check these sets to see if any of them have the same color on all three sides. If any set does, we output "YES"; otherwise, we output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function check_adjacent_sides(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           colors = test_case.split()
           if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or
               colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or
               colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or
               colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5] or
               colors[2] == colors[4] == colors[1] or
               colors[3] == colors[4] == colors[1] or
               colors[2] == colors[5] == colors[0] or
               colors[3] == colors[5] == colors[0]):
               print("YES")
           else:
               print("NO")
   ```

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We have a cube with six sides, each painted in one of six possible colors: black, blue, red, green, yellow, or orange. For multiple test cases, we need to determine if there are three sides of the cube that are adjacent to each other and painted the same color. The sides are given in the order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to check specific sets of three sides that are adjacent on a cube. The possible sets of three adjacent sides are:
   - Front, Left, Top
   - Front, Right, Top
   - Back, Left, Bottom
   - Back, Right, Bottom
   - Left, Top, Back
   - Right, Top, Back
   - Left, Bottom, Front
   - Right, Bottom, Front

   For each test case, we will check these sets to see if any of them have the same color on all three sides. If any set does, we output "YES"; otherwise, we output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function check_adjacent_sides(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           colors = test_case.split()
           if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or
               colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or
               colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or
               colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5] or
               colors[2] == colors[4] == colors[1] or
               colors[3] == colors[4] == colors[1] or
               colors[2] == colors[5] == colors[0] or

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine if a cube with six painted sides has any set of three adjacent sides painted the same color. The core concept here is understanding the adjacency of sides on a cube and checking specific combinations of these sides for color uniformity.

The key strategy was to identify the possible sets of three adjacent sides on a cube. These sets are:
- Front, Left, Top
- Front, Right, Top
- Back, Left, Bottom
- Back, Right, Bottom
- Left, Top, Back
- Right, Top, Back
- Left, Bottom, Front
- Right, Bottom, Front

For each test case, we split the input into individual colors and checked these specific combinations to see if any set of three sides shared the same color. If any set did, we output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

The solution was straightforward and efficient, leveraging simple string comparisons to solve the problem. The constraints allowed for this approach, as the number of test cases and the operations per test case were manageable within the given limits. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships and adjacency in 3D objects, which can be a common theme in computational geometry problems.

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

 l=list(map(str,input().split()))

   break
 if c==1:
  print("YES")
 else:
  print("NO")


INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my initial solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provides a slightly different approach that is worth noting for its use of Python's `set` data structure to check for uniformity among the colors of the sides.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Use of Tuples for Indices:**
   - The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the sides that need to be checked for each set of three adjacent sides. This is a clean and organized way to handle the different combinations.

2. **Set for Uniformity Check:**
   - The official solution uses a set to determine if all three sides in a combination are the same color. By converting the list of colors for a set of sides into a set, it checks if the length of the set is 1, which indicates all colors are the same. This is a concise and effective way to perform this check.

3. **Loop and Break:**
   - The solution uses a loop to iterate over the possible combinations and breaks out of the loop as soon as a valid combination is found. This is efficient as it avoids unnecessary checks once a solution is found.

### Reflection:

While my solution was correct, the official solution's use of a set to check for uniformity is a neat trick that simplifies the logic. It reduces the need for multiple equality checks and makes the code more readable. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with problems that require checking for identical elements in a collection. In future problems, leveraging Python's set operations can lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.

The main function is `check_adjacent_sides`.
INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case is a string representing the colors of six sides of a cube. For each test case, it checks if any set of three specific adjacent sides of the cube have the same color. If any such set of sides has the same color, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function evaluates eight possible combinations of three adjacent sides to determine if they are the same color. The input is read from standard input, with the first line indicating the number of test cases, followed by each test case on a new line.

[Problem]
    One day, Chef found a cube which has each of its sides painted in some color out of black, blue, red, green, yellow and orange.
    Now he asks you to check if he can choose three sides such that they are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
    - A single line of each test case contains six words denoting the colors of painted sides in the order: front, back, left, right, top and bottom, respectively.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, output a single line containing the word "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) corresponding to the answer of the problem.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤  50000 
    - Each color will be from the list {"black", "blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "orange"}

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask 1: (25 points)
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤  12000 
    - For each test case there will be at most three different colors

    Subtask 2: (75 points)
    - Original constraints

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    2
    blue yellow green orange black green
    green yellow green orange black green

    Output:
    NO
    YES

    -----Explanation-----

    Example case 1.
    There are no three sides with the same color.

    Example case 2.
    In this test case, the front, bottom and left sides are green (see picture).

                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # First line is the number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])

    # Remaining lines are the test cases
    test_cases = data[1:T+1]
