## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nexus 4.O is going to be organized by ASME, GLA University. Shubhanshu, Head of Finance Team is working for it. He has $N$ number of bills of different values as $a$$1$,$ a$$2$, $a$$3$â€¦$a$$n$.
He is interested in a game in which one has to do the addition of the bills. But due to privacy concerns, he cannot share the details with others. 
He can only trust his best friend Avani with such a confidential thing. So, he asked her to play this game.
Rules of the game :
- Avani needs to answer $Q$ queries.
- Every $Q$$i$ query has 2 values $X$$i$ and $Y$$i$.

INFO - [Task id] 615 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a number of test cases. For each test case, we are given a list of bills and a number of queries. Each query asks for the sum of a subarray of the list of bills, defined by two indices. We need to compute and return the sum for each query.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: First, read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of bills and the number of queries. Then, read the list of bills and the list of queries.

2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: To efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray, we can use a prefix sum array. The prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.

3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of the array from the start up to index `i`. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray from index `X` to `Y` as `prefix[Y] - prefix[X-1]`.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, use the prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of the specified subarray and store the result.

5. **Output**: After processing all queries for a test case, output the results.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_queries():
    read T  // number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read N and Q  // number of bills and number of queries
        read bills array of size N
        read queries array of size Q, each query has two values X and Y

        // Step 1: Create prefix sum array
        prefix_sum = array of size N+1 initialized to 0
        for i from 1 to N:
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + bills[i-1]

        // Step 2: Process each query
        results = empty list
        for each query (X, Y):
            sum = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X-1]
            append sum to results

        // Step 3: Output results for this test case
        for each result in results:
            print result
```

## Python Code

```python
def process_queries():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        Q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        bills = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        # Step 1: Create prefix sum array
        prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
        # Step 2: Process each query
        for _ in range(Q):
            X = int(data[index])
            Y = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            # Calculate the sum for the query
            sum_value = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
            results.append(sum_value)
    
    # Step 3: Output all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads input data, processes each test case using a prefix sum array for efficient subarray sum calculation, and outputs the results for each query.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
        At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
        This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
        Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
        - Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
        - $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
        - $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$
        - $1 \leq k \leq 100$

        -----Subtasks-----
        Subtask1 
        - 
        $1 \leq T \leq 10$
        - 
        $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^4$
        Subtask2
        - 
        Original Constraints 

        -----Sample Input:-----
        1
        5 3
        1 3 5
        2 5 2
        3 4 7

        -----Sample Output:-----
        202

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        Initial score of students will be : $[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$
        after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 50, 50, 10, 10]$
        after solving question 2 scores will be: $[50, 100, 100, 20, 20]$
        after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 100, 700, 140, 20]$
        Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will $(50+100+700+140+20)/5 = 202$

    [Previous Critique]:
        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the `main()` function, which contains the logic for reading input and producing output, is not being executed. In Python scripts, especially when using functions, it's crucial to ensure that the main logic is called when the script is executed.

        ### Steps to Identify the Problem

        1. **Check Function Execution**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script. Without this call, the script will define the functions but never execute them.
        2. **Input/Output Handling**: Verify that the input is being read correctly and that the output is being printed as expected.
        3. **Index Management**: Ensure that the index used to parse the input data is managed correctly to avoid any off-by-one errors or incorrect data parsing.

        ### Correction Steps

        1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Add a call to the `main()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        2. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the input parsing logic to ensure that it correctly handles the input format and constraints.

        ### Revised Solution

        ```python
        def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
            # Initialize scores for each student
            scores = [10] * N
    
            # Process each question
            for i, j, k in questions:
                for student in range(i, j + 1):
                    scores[student] *= k
    
            # Calculate the mean of the scores
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
            return mean_score

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                M = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                questions = []

        ### Explanation

        - **Function Call**: The `main()` function is now called when the script is executed, ensuring that the input is read and processed, and the output is printed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, split into a list of strings, and parsed using an index to handle multiple test cases efficiently.
        - **Output**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed at the end. This ensures that all outputs are correctly displayed.

[Reflection]:
    The problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after smashing them together is essentially a partition problem. The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. My initial approach used a dynamic programming array to track possible sums, which is a common technique for partition problems.

    The official solution, however, uses a set to track possible sums, which is a more elegant and concise approach. Here's a breakdown of the official solution:

    1. **Initialization**: Start with a set `dp` containing only the sum `0`. This set will be used to track all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones.

    2. **Iterate through stones**: For each stone, update the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in `dp`. This is done using set comprehension, which efficiently updates the set with new possible sums.

    3. **Calculate the result**: After processing all stones, the set `dp` contains all possible sums. The goal is to find the sum that, when doubled and subtracted from the total weight, gives the smallest possible result. This is achieved by iterating through the set and calculating the minimum of `abs(total - 2 * _sum)` for each `_sum` in `dp`.

    The official solution is insightful because it leverages Python's set operations to efficiently manage and update possible sums, resulting in a more concise and potentially faster implementation compared to the traditional dynamic programming array approach. This solution is particularly elegant in its use of set comprehension to handle the sum updates in a single line, making the code both compact and easy to understand.

INFO - [Task id] 615 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to help Avani answer a series of queries about the sum of values in a list of bills. For each query, we are given two indices, and we need to calculate the sum of the values between these indices (inclusive). This needs to be done for multiple test cases.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: We will first read the number of test cases. For each test case, we will read the number of bills and the number of queries. Then, we will read the list of bill values and the list of queries.

2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: To efficiently calculate the sum for each query, we will use a prefix sum array. The prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.

3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of the array from the start up to index `i`. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray `[X, Y]` as `prefix[Y] - prefix[X-1]`.

4. **Answer Queries**: For each query, use the prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of the specified range.

5. **Output**: For each test case, output the results of all queries.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_cases():
    read T  # number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read N, Q  # number of bills and number of queries
        read bills  # list of N bill values
        read queries  # list of Q queries, each with two indices X and Y

        # Create prefix sum array
        prefix_sum = array of size N+1 initialized to 0
        for i from 1 to N:
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + bills[i-1]

        # Process each query
        results = []
        for each query (X, Y):
            sum_value = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X-1]
            append sum_value to results

        # Output results for the current test case
        for result in results:
            print result
```

### Final Python Solution

def process_test_cases():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        Q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        bills = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        queries = []
        for _ in range(Q):
            X = int(data[index])
            Y = int(data[index + 1])
            queries.append((X, Y))
            index += 2
        
        # Create prefix sum array
        prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
        # Process each query
        for X, Y in queries:
            sum_value = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
            results.append(sum_value)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

### Explanation

- **Prefix Sum Array**: We use a prefix sum array to store cumulative sums of the bills. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.
- **Query Processing**: For each query, we use the prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of the specified range.
- **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient, with the prefix sum array allowing each query to be answered in constant time after an initial linear time setup. This is crucial given the constraints.

### Explanation

- **Prefix Sum Array**: We use a prefix sum array to store cumulative sums of the bills. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.
- **Query Processing**: For each query, we use the prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of the specified range.
- **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient, with the prefix sum array allowing each query to be answered in constant time after an initial linear time setup. This is crucial given the constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 615 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was efficiently calculating the sum of subarrays for multiple queries. The key strategy was to use a prefix sum array, which allows for constant time sum calculations after an initial linear time setup. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets and multiple queries, as it significantly reduces the time complexity compared to recalculating sums for each query.

The prefix sum array is constructed by iterating through the list of bills and maintaining a running total. For each query, the sum of the subarray can be quickly determined by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the range from the prefix sum at the end of the range.

This problem reinforced the importance of preprocessing data to enable efficient query handling, a common pattern in competitive programming and algorithm design. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered, highlighting the effectiveness of the prefix sum technique for this type of problem.

INFO - [Task id] 615 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to help Avani answer a series of queries about the sum of values in a list of bills. For each query, we are given two indices, and we need to calculate the sum of the values between these indices (inclusive). This needs to be done for multiple test cases.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: We will first read the number of test cases. For each test case, we will read the number of bills and the number of queries. Then, we will read the list of bill values and the list of queries.

2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: To efficiently calculate the sum for each query, we will use a prefix sum array. The prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.

3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of the array from the start up to index `i`. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray `[X, Y]` as `prefix[Y] - prefix[X-1]`.

4. **Answer Queries**: For each query, use the prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of the specified range.

5. **Output**: For each test case, output the results of all queries.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_cases():
    read T  # number of test cases
    for each test case:
        read N, Q  # number of bills and number of queries
        read bills  # list of N bill values
        read queries  # list of Q queries, each with two indices X and Y

        # Create prefix sum array
        prefix_sum = array of size N+1 initialized to 0
        for i from 1 to N:
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + bills[i-1]

        # Process each query
        results = []
        for each query (X, Y):
            sum_value = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X-1]
            append sum_value to results

        # Output results for the current test case
        for result in results:
            print result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def process_test_cases():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        Q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        bills = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        
        queries = []
        for _ in range(Q):
            X = int(data[index])
            Y = int(data[index + 1])
            queries.append((X, Y))
            index += 2
        
        # Create prefix sum array
        prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
        # Process each query
        for X, Y in queries:
            sum_value = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

  print(su) 

INFO - [Task id] 615 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution was efficient and correct. However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights:

1. **Efficiency**: The official solution uses a direct approach by iterating over the range specified in each query to calculate the sum. This results in a time complexity of \(O(N \times Q)\) for each test case, which can be inefficient for large inputs. In contrast, my solution uses a prefix sum array, allowing each query to be answered in constant time \(O(1)\) after an initial \(O(N)\) setup, making it much more efficient for large datasets.

2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The official solution includes a modulo operation with \(1000000000\) during the sum calculation. This is not mentioned in the problem statement, and my solution does not include it. If the problem required this, it would be a crucial detail to incorporate.

3. **Code Readability**: My solution is structured with clear separation of input parsing, prefix sum calculation, and query processing, which enhances readability and maintainability. The official solution is more compact but less readable due to nested loops and lack of comments.

In summary, my approach using a prefix sum array is more efficient for large inputs, and the official solution highlights the importance of considering any additional constraints like modular arithmetic that might be implied but not explicitly stated.
