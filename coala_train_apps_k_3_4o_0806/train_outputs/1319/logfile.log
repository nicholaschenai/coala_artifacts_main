## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

We have a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king visits the court. Each citizen's wealth is a unique positive integer, and a king's visit is denoted by `-1`. When the king visits, the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive is beheaded. We need to determine the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at each of the king's visits.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Data Structure Choice**: Use a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen who is still alive. A max-heap allows us to quickly retrieve and remove the largest element.

2. **Processing Events**:
   - For each citizen's wealth declaration, add the wealth to the max-heap.
   - For each king's visit (`-1`), remove the richest citizen from the heap and record their wealth as they are beheaded.

3. **Output**: For each king's visit, output the wealth of the beheaded citizen.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty max-heap.
2. For each event in the sequence:
   - If the event is a positive integer (citizen's wealth), add it to the max-heap.
   - If the event is `-1` (king's visit):
     - Remove the maximum element from the heap (the richest citizen still alive).
     - Record this wealth as the beheaded citizen's wealth.
3. Print the recorded wealths for each king's visit.

## Python Solution

```python
import sys
import heapq

def process_events():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = int(data[1])
    
    events = data[2:]
    
    # Max-heap to store the wealth of citizens
    max_heap = []
    
    # List to store the results of each king's visit
    results = []
    
    for event in events:
        if event == '-1':
            # King visits, pop the richest citizen
            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            results.append(richest)
        else:
            # Citizen declares wealth, add to heap
            wealth = int(event)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)
    
    # Output the results for each king's visit
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a max-heap to keep track of the richest citizens. Python's `heapq` module provides a min-heap, so we store negative values to simulate a max-heap.
- We read all input data at once and split it into a list of strings.
- We iterate over each event:
  - If it's a positive integer, we convert it to a negative and push it onto the heap.
  - If it's `-1`, we pop the largest (most negative) value from the heap, convert it back to positive, and record it as the wealth of the beheaded citizen.
- Finally, we print the wealth of the beheaded citizen for each king's visit.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to maximize the amount of money Mr. Krabs could collect from a series of locked rooms using a limited number of keys. The challenge was to determine the optimal strategy for unlocking rooms, given that only the rooms at the two ends could be initially accessed.

    The solution involved a greedy approach, where the goal was to unlock rooms with the highest money values first. This was achieved by simulating a priority queue using a list to keep track of the most valuable rooms that could be unlocked next. The strategy was applied from both ends of the room sequence, and the maximum money collected from either strategy was chosen as the final result.

    Key insights included:
    - Using a max-heap (simulated with a sorted list) to always unlock the room with the most money.
    - Considering both possible starting points (leftmost and rightmost rooms) to ensure the optimal path was chosen.
    - Efficiently managing the unlocking process by keeping track of unlocked rooms and adjacent possibilities.

    The solution was efficient and passed all tests, demonstrating the effectiveness of the greedy approach in this context. This problem reinforced the importance of exploring multiple starting points and using data structures like heaps to prioritize decisions based on value.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Problem-Solving Process

    The problem required maximizing the expression `A[d] - A[c] + A[b] - A[a]` with the constraint `d > c > b > a`. The challenge was to efficiently compute this maximum value given the constraints and the size of the input array.

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns

    - **Dynamic Programming**: The solution involved using dynamic programming to track the maximum possible values for each segment of the expression as we iterate through the array. This approach ensures that the constraints are respected and the expression is maximized.

    - **Iterative Backtracking**: By iterating through the array and maintaining running maximums for each part of the expression, we can efficiently compute the desired result without needing to check all possible combinations explicitly.

    #### Strategies and Fixes

    - **Initial Mistake**: The initial approach did not correctly handle the constraints and failed to track the necessary maximums for each segment of the expression. This led to incorrect results.

    - **Correct Approach**: By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using arrays to store intermediate maximum values (`max_a`, `max_b_minus_a`, `max_c_plus_b_minus_a`, `max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a`), the solution was able to correctly compute the maximum value of the expression.

    - **Input/Output Handling**: Ensuring that the input is read correctly from standard input and the result is printed to standard output was crucial for the solution to work in a competitive programming environment.

    #### Code Snippet

    Here's the final solution that correctly implements the logic:

    ```python
    def maximizeExpression(N, A):
        max_a = [0] * N
        max_b_minus_a = [0] * N
        max_c_plus_b_minus_a = [0] * N
        max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a = [0] * N

        max_a[0] = -A[0]
        for i in range(1, N):
            max_a[i] = max(max_a[i-1], -A[i])

        max_b_minus_a[1] = A[1] + max_a[0]
        for i in range(2, N):
            max_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_b_minus_a[i-1], A[i] + max_a[i-1])

        max_c_plus_b_minus_a[2] = -A[2] + max_b_minus_a[1]
        for i in range(3, N):
            max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1], -A[i] + max_b_minus_a[i-1])

        max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[3] = A[3] + max_c_plus_b_minus_a[2]
        for i in range(4, N):
            max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1], A[i] + max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1])

        return max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[N-1]

    # Read input from standard input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    N = int(data[0])
    A = list(map(int, data[1:]))

    result = maximizeExpression(N, A)
    print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down complex expressions into manageable parts and using dynamic programming to efficiently solve problems with constraints.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of citizens entering a court, each declaring their wealth. Occasionally, the king visits the court, and during each visit, the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive is executed. We need to determine the wealth of the citizen executed during each of the king's visits.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Data Structure Choice**: Use a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen who is still alive. A max-heap allows us to quickly retrieve and remove the maximum element, which is ideal for this problem.

2. **Processing the Input**: As we process each line of input:
   - If it's a positive integer, it represents a citizen's wealth. Add this wealth to the max-heap.
   - If it's `-1`, it represents a king's visit. Remove the richest citizen from the heap and record their wealth as the executed citizen.

3. **Handling Execution**: Since the problem guarantees that there will always be someone to execute when the king visits, we don't need to handle cases where the heap is empty.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_wealth_and_visits(N, M, events):
    initialize a max-heap
    initialize an empty list for results

    for each event in events:
        if event is a positive integer:
            add event to the max-heap
        else if event is -1:
            extract the maximum from the max-heap
            append the extracted value to results

    return results
```

### Python Code

```python
import sys
import heapq

def process_wealth_and_visits(N, M, events):
    # Max-heap to store the wealth of citizens
    max_heap = []
    results = []

 ### Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of citizens entering a court, each declaring their wealth. Occasionally, the king visits the court, and during each visit, the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive is executed. We need to determine the wealth of the citizen executed during each of the king's visits.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Data Structure Choice**: Use a max-heap to efficiently track the richest citizen who is still alive. A max-heap allows us to quickly retrieve and remove the maximum element, which is ideal for this problem.

2. **Processing the Input**: As we process each line of input:
   - If it's a positive integer, it represents a citizen's wealth. Add this wealth to the max-heap.
   - If it's `-1`, it represents a king's visit. Remove the richest citizen from the heap and record their wealth as the executed citizen.

3. **Handling Execution**: Since the problem guarantees that there will always be someone to execute when the king visits, we don't need to handle cases where the heap is empty.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_wealth_and_visits(N, M, events):
    initialize a max-heap
    initialize an empty list for results

    for each event in events:
        if event is a positive integer:
            add event to the max-heap
        else if event is -1:
            extract the maximum from the max-heap
            append the extracted value to results

    return results
```

### Python Code

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was efficiently managing a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king occasionally visits to execute the richest citizen still alive. The challenge was to quickly identify and remove the richest citizen during each king's visit, which is a classic use case for a max-heap data structure.

To implement this, I used Python's `heapq` module, which provides a min-heap by default. By storing negative values, I effectively simulated a max-heap, allowing for efficient retrieval and removal of the maximum wealth value. This approach ensures that both insertion and extraction operations are performed in logarithmic time, which is crucial given the constraints of up to 100,000 citizens and 10,000 visits.

The solution involved reading input data, processing each event to either add a citizen's wealth to the heap or execute the richest citizen during a king's visit, and then outputting the results. The use of a heap was straightforward and effective, and the problem was solved without any unexpected errors. This exercise reinforced the utility of heaps in scenarios requiring frequent access to the maximum or minimum element in a dynamic dataset.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution using a max-heap was efficient and passed all test cases. However, the official solution uses a simpler approach by maintaining a list of wealth values and iterating through it to find the maximum wealth each time the king visits. This approach is less efficient than using a heap, especially for larger inputs, as it involves scanning the list repeatedly, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.

Key insights from the official solution:
- The official solution directly modifies the list to mark executed citizens by setting their wealth to `-1`. This is a simple way to keep track of which citizens are still "alive."
- The solution iterates over the list to find the maximum wealth each time the king visits, which is straightforward but not optimal for large datasets.

In contrast, my approach using a max-heap is more efficient:
- **Heap Efficiency**: Using a heap allows for efficient retrieval and removal of the maximum element, which is crucial given the constraints.
- **Time Complexity**: The heap-based solution has a time complexity of O(log N) for each insertion and removal, making it more suitable for large inputs compared to the O(N) scan in the official solution.

Overall, while the official solution is simpler and works for the given constraints, the heap-based approach is more scalable and efficient for larger input sizes. This exercise reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structure to optimize performance.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the core concept was efficiently managing a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king occasionally visits to execute the richest citizen still alive. The challenge was to quickly identify and remove the richest citizen during each king's visit, which is ...,

INFO - Updated entry: The problem was straightforward, and my solution using a max-heap was efficient and passed all test cases. However, the official solution uses a simpler approach by maintaining a list of wealth values and iterating through it to find the maximum wealth each time the king visits. This approach is ...,

The main function is `main`.
INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes two integers followed by a list of integers representing events. It processes these events to manage a max-heap of wealth values, where positive integers are added to the heap and a special event marked by -1 triggers the removal and recording of the maximum wealth value. The results of these removals are stored in a list. Finally, the function prints each recorded maximum wealth value in the order they were removed.

[Problem]
    A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
    The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
    The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
    Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
    1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
    and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
    At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
    You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
    Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
    The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

    -----Output:-----
    Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
    - $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
    - You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.
