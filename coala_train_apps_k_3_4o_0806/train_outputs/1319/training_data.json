    "summary": "In this problem, the core concept was efficiently managing a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king occasionally visits to execute the richest citizen still alive. The challenge was to quickly identify and remove the richest citizen during each king's visit, which is a classic use case for a max-heap data structure.\n\nTo implement this, I used Python's `heapq` module, which provides a min-heap by default. By storing negative values, I effectively simulated a max-heap, allowing for efficient retrieval and removal of the maximum wealth value. This approach ensures that both insertion and extraction operations are performed in logarithmic time, which is crucial given the constraints of up to 100,000 citizens and 10,000 visits.\n\nThe solution involved reading input data, processing each event to either add a citizen's wealth to the heap or execute the richest citizen during a king's visit, and then outputting the results. The use of a heap was straightforward and effective, and the problem was solved without any unexpected errors. This exercise reinforced the utility of heaps in scenarios requiring frequent access to the maximum or minimum element in a dynamic dataset.",
    "reflection": "The problem was straightforward, and my solution using a max-heap was efficient and passed all test cases. However, the official solution uses a simpler approach by maintaining a list of wealth values and iterating through it to find the maximum wealth each time the king visits. This approach is less efficient than using a heap, especially for larger inputs, as it involves scanning the list repeatedly, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n- The official solution directly modifies the list to mark executed citizens by setting their wealth to `-1`. This is a simple way to keep track of which citizens are still \"alive.\"\n- The solution iterates over the list to find the maximum wealth each time the king visits, which is straightforward but not optimal for large datasets.\n\nIn contrast, my approach using a max-heap is more efficient:\n- **Heap Efficiency**: Using a heap allows for efficient retrieval and removal of the maximum element, which is crucial given the constraints.\n- **Time Complexity**: The heap-based solution has a time complexity of O(log N) for each insertion and removal, making it more suitable for large inputs compared to the O(N) scan in the official solution.\n\nOverall, while the official solution is simpler and works for the given constraints, the heap-based approach is more scalable and efficient for larger input sizes. This exercise reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structure to optimize performance.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes two integers followed by a list of integers representing events. It processes these events to manage a max-heap of wealth values, where positive integers are added to the heap and a special event marked by -1 triggers the removal and recording of the maximum wealth value. The results of these removals are stored in a list. Finally, the function prints each recorded maximum wealth value in the order they were removed.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to efficiently manage and retrieve the maximum value from a dynamic list of elements, especially when elements are being added and removed frequently. The use of a max-heap (simulated using a min-heap with negative values) is a common technique in computer science for such tasks. This approach is particularly beneficial in real-time systems or applications where quick access to the largest element is required, such as in priority queues, scheduling tasks, or managing resources in a system. Additionally, understanding how to handle interleaved operations (like citizen appearances and king visits) is crucial in designing algorithms that need to process events in a specific order while maintaining certain constraints."
