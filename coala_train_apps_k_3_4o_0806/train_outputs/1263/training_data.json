    "summary": "In this problem, the task was to determine the number of ways a natural number \\( N \\) can be expressed as the sum of unique positive integers each raised to the power \\( K \\). The solution involved using a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers.\n\n### Core Concepts and Patterns\n- **Recursive Backtracking**: This technique was crucial for exploring all potential combinations of integers that could sum to \\( N \\). The recursion allowed us to try each integer, calculate its \\( K \\)-th power, and then attempt to complete the sum with subsequent integers.\n- **Unique Combinations**: Ensuring that each combination used unique integers was a key requirement. This was managed by starting each recursive call with the next integer, preventing reuse of the same integer in a combination.\n\n### Strategies\n- **Early Termination**: By breaking the loop when the \\( K \\)-th power of an integer exceeded the remaining sum, we efficiently pruned the search space, reducing unnecessary calculations.\n- **Nonlocal Variables**: Using a nonlocal variable to keep track of the count of valid combinations was effective in maintaining state across recursive calls.\n\n### Code Snippet\n```python\ndef countWays(N, K):\n    def backtrack(remaining, start):\n        nonlocal count\n        if remaining == 0:\n            count += 1\n            return\n        for i in range(start, N + 1):\n            power = i ** K\n            if power > remaining:\n                break\n            backtrack(remaining - power, i + 1)\n\n    count = 0\n    backtrack(N, 1)\n    return count\n```\n\nThis problem reinforced the utility of recursive backtracking for combinatorial problems, especially when constraints like uniqueness are involved. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and the solution passed all test cases successfully.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem of finding the number of ways to express a number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \\( K \\) can be approached using dynamic programming, as demonstrated in the official solution. This approach is both efficient and elegant, leveraging a dynamic programming array to keep track of reachable sums.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The solution uses an array `reach` where `reach[j]` indicates the number of ways to form the sum \\( j \\) using the powers of integers. This is a classic dynamic programming approach to subset sum problems.\n\n2. **Iterative Construction**: The solution iteratively considers each integer \\( i \\) and its \\( K \\)-th power, updating the `reach` array to reflect the new sums that can be formed by including \\( i^K \\).\n\n3. **Efficiency**: By iterating over possible integers and updating the `reach` array in reverse order, the solution efficiently builds up the number of ways to reach each sum up to \\( N \\). This avoids redundant calculations and ensures that each combination of integers is unique.\n\n4. **Space Complexity**: The use of a single array of size \\( N+1 \\) ensures that the space complexity is manageable, even for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\n#### Comparison with My Approach:\n\n- **Recursive Backtracking**: My initial approach used recursive backtracking to explore all possible combinations. While correct, this method can be less efficient due to the potential for exploring redundant paths and recalculating results for the same subproblems.\n\n- **Dynamic Programming Advantage**: The official solution's use of dynamic programming is more efficient, especially for larger inputs, as it systematically builds up solutions and avoids redundant calculations.\n\nIn summary, the official solution provides a more efficient and scalable approach to the problem by leveraging dynamic programming. This experience highlights the importance of considering dynamic programming for problems involving combinations and sums, especially when constraints allow for such optimizations.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input from the standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers, N and K, and calculates the number of ways to express N as a sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of K. It uses a helper function to perform a backtracking search to find all possible combinations. The results for each test case are stored in a list and then printed out sequentially. The function handles multiple test cases in a single execution.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the number of ways a number can be expressed as a sum of unique powers of integers. This is particularly relevant in combinatorial mathematics and number theory, where such problems often arise. It can be applied in algorithm design, especially in dynamic programming and recursive backtracking, to solve problems involving partitioning numbers into sums of powers. Additionally, this concept is useful in competitive programming and coding interviews, where similar problems are frequently encountered. Understanding how to implement a backtracking solution to explore all possible combinations of numbers that satisfy a given condition is a valuable skill in these contexts."
