INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of the \( K \)-th powers of unique positive integers. We are given multiple test cases, each with its own \( N \) and \( K \).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find combinations of unique positive integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

2. **Approach**:
   - Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers.
   - For each integer starting from 1, calculate its \( K \)-th power and check if it can be part of the sum.
   - If adding this power to the current sum does not exceed \( N \), recursively attempt to find the rest of the sum using the next integers.
   - Ensure that each combination uses unique integers by always considering integers greater than the last used integer.
   - Count each valid combination that sums exactly to \( N \).

3. **Constraints Handling**:
   - The maximum value for \( N \) is 1000, and \( K \) can be up to 6, so the powers can be large, but the number of integers to consider is limited by the fact that their powers should not exceed \( N \).

### Pseudocode

```
function countWays(N, K):
    define recursive function findWays(current_sum, start):
        if current_sum == N:
            increment the count of valid ways
            return
        for each integer i starting from 'start':
            calculate power = i^K
            if current_sum + power > N:
                break the loop
            recursively call findWays(current_sum + power, i + 1)

    initialize count to 0
    call findWays(0, 1)
    return count

read T
for each test case:
    read N, K
    print countWays(N, K)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def countWays(N, K):
    def findWays(current_sum, start):
        nonlocal count
        if current_sum == N:
            count += 1
            return
        for i in range(start, N + 1):
            power = i ** K
            if current_sum + power > N:
                break
            findWays(current_sum + power, i + 1)

    count = 0
    findWays(0, 1)
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(countWays(N, K))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum to \( N \). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed sequentially.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    **Initial Strategy:**
    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \( N \).

    **Correct Strategy:**
    The correct formula is:
    \[ \text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \]
    This formula:
    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.
    - Uses \( 3^{(N-2)} \) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.
    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.

    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        ### Step-by-Step Analysis

        1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.

        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.

        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.

        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.

        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.

        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.

        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.

        ### Potential Issues

        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.

        ### Correction

        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.

        ### Corrected Code

        ```python
        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod
            return factorials, inverses

        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod

        def solve_queries():

        This corrected code should now properly execute and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's correct the solution by ensuring that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This will allow the program to execute and produce the expected output. Here is the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)
            for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
                factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod
            inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)
            for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
                inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod
            return factorials, inverses

        def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod

        def solve_queries():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            MOD = 10**9 + 7
            max_n = 4000
            factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, MOD)
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                Q = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                for _ in range(Q):
                    I = int(data[index])
                    K = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    if K > I:
                        results.append(0)
                    else:
                        count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)
                        count_greater = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                        result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD
                        results.append(result)
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(map(str, results)) + "\n")

        # Call the function to execute the solution
        solve_queries()
        ```

        This code should now correctly read input, process each test case, and output the results as expected. The main issue was that the function `solve_queries()` was not being called, which has now been fixed.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

The problem is to determine the number of ways a given natural number \( N \) can be expressed as the sum of unique positive integers each raised to the power \( K \). We are given multiple test cases, each with different values of \( N \) and \( K \).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find all combinations of unique positive integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

2. **Approach**:
   - Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers.
   - Start with the smallest integer and try to build up to \( N \) by adding the \( K \)-th powers of subsequent integers.
   - Ensure that each combination uses unique integers.
   - Count each valid combination that sums to \( N \).

3. **Constraints**:
   - The maximum value for \( N \) is 1000, and \( K \) can be as large as 6.
   - This means we need to consider integers up to the point where their \( K \)-th power is less than or equal to \( N \).

### Pseudocode

```
function countWays(N, K):
    define a helper function backtrack(remaining, start):
        if remaining == 0:
            increment the count of valid ways
            return
        for each integer i starting from 'start':
            calculate power = i^K
            if power > remaining:
                break the loop

    call backtrack(N, 1)
    return count

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq K \leq 6$

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4 1
38 2

-----Sample Output:-----
2
1

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the number of ways a natural number \( N \) can be expressed as the sum of unique positive integers each raised to the power \( K \). The solution involved using a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers.

### Core Concepts and Patterns
- **Recursive Backtracking**: This technique was crucial for exploring all potential combinations of integers that could sum to \( N \). The recursion allowed us to try each integer, calculate its \( K \)-th power, and then attempt to complete the sum with subsequent integers.
- **Unique Combinations**: Ensuring that each combination used unique integers was a key requirement. This was managed by starting each recursive call with the next integer, preventing reuse of the same integer in a combination.

### Strategies
- **Early Termination**: By breaking the loop when the \( K \)-th power of an integer exceeded the remaining sum, we efficiently pruned the search space, reducing unnecessary calculations.
- **Nonlocal Variables**: Using a nonlocal variable to keep track of the count of valid combinations was effective in maintaining state across recursive calls.

### Code Snippet
```python
def countWays(N, K):
    def backtrack(remaining, start):
        nonlocal count
        if remaining == 0:
            count += 1
            return
        for i in range(start, N + 1):
            power = i ** K
            if power > remaining:
                break

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq K \leq 6$

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4 1
38 2

-----Sample Output:-----
2
1

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

The problem is to determine the number of ways a given natural number \( N \) can be expressed as the sum of unique positive integers each raised to the power \( K \). We are given multiple test cases, each with different values of \( N \) and \( K \).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find all combinations of unique positive integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

2. **Approach**:
   - Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers.
   - Start with the smallest integer and try to build up to \( N \) by adding the \( K \)-th powers of subsequent integers.
   - Ensure that each combination uses unique integers.
   - Count each valid combination that sums to \( N \).

3. **Constraints**:
   - The maximum value for \( N \) is 1000, and \( K \) can be as large as 6.
   - This means we need to consider integers up to the point where their \( K \)-th power is less than or equal to \( N \).

### Pseudocode

```
function countWays(N, K):
    define a helper function backtrack(remaining, start):
        if remaining == 0:
            increment the count of valid ways
            return
        for each integer i starting from 'start':
            calculate power = i^K
            if power > remaining:
                break the loop
            call backtrack(remaining - power, i + 1)

    initialize count to 0
    call backtrack(N, 1)
    return count

read T (number of test cases)
for each test case:
    read N and K
    print countWays(N, K)
```

### Final Python Code

```python
def countWays(N, K):
    def backtrack(remaining, start):
        nonlocal count
        if remaining == 0:
            count += 1
            return
        for i in range(start, N + 1):
            power = i ** K
            if power > remaining:
                break
            backtrack(remaining - power, i + 1)

    count = 0
    backtrack(N, 1)
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(countWays(N, K))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **countWays Function**: This function uses a helper function `backtrack` to recursively find all combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum to \( N \).
- **backtrack Function**: It takes the remaining sum needed and the starting integer. It iterates over possible integers, calculates their \( K \)-th power, and recursively tries to complete the sum.
- **Main Function**: Reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result using the `countWays` function.

The problem of finding the number of ways to express a number \( N \) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \( K \) can be approached using dynamic programming, as demonstrated in the official solution. This approach is both efficient and elegant, leveraging a dynamic programming array to keep track of reachable sums.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The solution uses an array `reach` where `reach[j]` indicates the number of ways to form the sum \( j \) using the powers of integers. This is a classic dynamic programming approach to subset sum problems.

2. **Iterative Construction**: The solution iteratively considers each integer \( i \) and its \( K \)-th power, updating the `reach` array to reflect the new sums that can be formed by including \( i^K \).

3. **Efficiency**: By iterating over possible integers and updating the `reach` array in reverse order, the solution efficiently builds up the number of ways to reach each sum up to \( N \). This avoids redundant calculations and ensures that each combination of integers is unique.

4. **Space Complexity**: The use of a single array of size \( N+1 \) ensures that the space complexity is manageable, even for larger values of \( N \).

#### Comparison with My Approach:

- **Recursive Backtracking**: My initial approach used recursive backtracking to explore all possible combinations. While correct, this method can be less efficient due to the potential for exploring redundant paths and recalculating results for the same subproblems.

- **Dynamic Programming Advantage**: The official solution's use of dynamic programming is more efficient, especially for larger inputs, as it systematically builds up solutions and avoids redundant calculations.

In summary, the official solution provides a more efficient and scalable approach to the problem by leveraging dynamic programming. This experience highlights the importance of considering dynamic programming for problems involving combinations and sums, especially when constraints allow for such optimizations.
