## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1
3 1 2

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a number `N` and a number `K`, followed by `K` permutations of the numbers from `1` to `N`. Our task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order for each of these `K` permutations and output them.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in the order they would appear if sorted.

2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:
   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair of consecutive elements where the earlier element is smaller than the later one. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.
   - Swap this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger than it.
   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position of the first element to get the smallest possible order.

3. **Edge Case**: If the permutation is the last in lexicographic order (i.e., sorted in descending order), the next permutation is the first permutation (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

### Pseudocode

```
function next_permutation(perm):
    n = length of perm
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i == -1:
        reverse perm from start to end
        return perm
    j = n - 1
    while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
        j -= 1
    swap perm[i] and perm[j]
    reverse perm from i + 1 to end
    return perm

read N, K
for each permutation in input:
    result = next_permutation(permutation)
    print result
```

### Python Code

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    n = len(perm)
    i = n - 2
    
    # Find the first decreasing element from the end
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    
    if i == -1:
        # If no such element is found, the permutation is the last one
        perm.reverse()
    else:
        # Find the smallest element larger than perm[i] to the right of i
        j = n - 1
        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
            j -= 1
        # Swap elements at i and j
        perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
        # Reverse the sequence from i+1 to end to get the next permutation
        perm[i + 1:] = reversed(perm[i + 1:])
    
    return perm

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    
    index = 2
    results = []
    for _ in range(K):
        permutation = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, next_perm)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads input from standard input, processes each permutation to find its next lexicographic permutation, and prints the results. The `next_permutation` function implements the logic to find the next permutation as described in the conceptual solution.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 40

        -1
        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        ### Analysis of the Current Solution
        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input and `sys.stdout.write` to output results. This is appropriate for competitive programming but can be tricky if not handled correctly. The function `find_permutation` is defined but not called, which means the code doesn't execute.

        2. **Logic for Permutation Construction**:
           - The logic attempts to start with the maximum possible sum by using a descending order permutation.
           - It then tries to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K by swapping adjacent elements.

        3. **Mistakes and Misunderstandings**:
           - The function `find_permutation` is defined but never called, so no logic is executed.
           - The permutation adjustment logic might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the sum needs to be reduced by more than one at a time.
           - The permutation construction logic might not correctly handle cases where the desired sum K is exactly the maximum possible sum.

        ### Steps to Correct the Solution
        1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: Make sure the function is executed by calling it after its definition.
        2. **Refine the Permutation Adjustment Logic**:
           - Ensure that the logic correctly reduces the sum to K by considering larger swaps or more efficient adjustments.
           - Handle edge cases where the desired sum is exactly the maximum possible sum.

        3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test the solution with various edge cases to ensure correctness.

        ### Revised Solution
        Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

        ```python
        def find_permutation():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)
                min_possible = N - 1
                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        
                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    # Start with the permutation in descending order
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                    current_sum = max_possible
            
                    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
                    for i in range(N - 1):
                        if current_sum == K:
                            break
                        # Calculate the current max of the pair
                        current_max = max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1])
                        # Calculate the new max if we swap
                        new_max = max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i + 2] if i + 2 < N else 0)
                        # Calculate the difference
                        diff = current_max - new_max
                        # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap
                        if current_sum - diff >= K:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_sum -= diff
            
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        # Call the function to execute
        find_permutation()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes
        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure execution.
        - **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.
        - **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called and the logic is correctly implemented to handle the permutation construction and adjustment. Here's the corrected code:

        ```python
        def find_permutation():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read

            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)
                min_possible = N - 1
                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        
                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:

            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        # Call the function to execute
        find_permutation()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes
        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure execution.
        - **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.
        - **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.

        This code should now correctly read from standard input, process each test case, and print the expected output.

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 40
        - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file â‰¤ 106
        - 0 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 2 * 1010

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        3
        4 12
        2 2
        5 14

        Output:
        -1
        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

        ### Problem Restatement
        We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and need to find a permutation such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

        ### Conceptual Solution
        1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:
           \[
           f(P) = \max(p_1, p_2) + \max(p_2, p_3) + \ldots + \max(p_{N-1}, p_N)
           \]

        2. **Constraints and Observations**:
           - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.
           - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \(\frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\).

        3. **Approach**:
           - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
           - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

        4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
           - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
           - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

        ### Pseudocode
        ```
        function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
            for each (N, K) in test_cases:
                if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:
                    output -1
                else:
                    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
                    i = 0
                    while current_sum > K:
                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i+1]:
                            swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
                            current_sum -= 1
                        i += 1
                    output permutation
        ```

        ### Final Python Code
        ```python
        def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                if K < N - 1 or K > (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
                    i = 0
                    while current_sum > K:
                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_sum -= 1
                        i += 1
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        ```

        ### Explanation
        - We start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
        - We then iteratively swap adjacent elements to reduce the sum until it matches K.
        - This approach ensures that we efficiently find a permutation that satisfies the condition or determine that it's impossible.

    [description for function: find_permutation]
    The function reads input data to determine the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads two integers, N and K. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible values of a function f(P) for a permutation of numbers from 1 to N. If K is outside this range, it appends "-1" to the results. Otherwise, it starts with a permutation in descending order and attempts to adjust it to achieve the desired sum K by swapping elements to reduce the current sum. Finally, it outputs the resulting permutation or "-1" for each test case.

    [end of description]
    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to construct a specific permutation of numbers to achieve a desired sum of maximum values from consecutive pairs. This is particularly relevant in combinatorial optimization problems, algorithm design, and competitive programming where constraints on permutations and their properties are given. Understanding how to manipulate permutations to achieve a specific function value can be applied to problems involving sequence optimization, resource allocation, and scheduling where similar constraints and objectives are present. Additionally, this problem highlights the importance of understanding the range of possible values a function can take based on its inputs, which is a common theme in mathematical problem-solving and algorithm analysis.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and need to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. The input consists of multiple permutations, and for each permutation, we need to output the next permutation in lexicographic order.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: 
   - Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in the smallest possible order that is greater than the current permutation.

2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:
   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair where the earlier number is smaller than the later number. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.
   - Swap this number with the smallest number that is larger than it to the right of it.
   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position to get the smallest possible order.

3. **Edge Case**:
   - If the permutation is the largest possible (i.e., in descending order), the next permutation is the smallest possible (i.e., in ascending order).

It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and need to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. The input consists of multiple permutations, and for each permutation, we need to output the next permutation in lexicographic order.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: 
   - Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in the smallest possible order that is greater than the current permutation.

2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:
   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair where the earlier number is smaller than the later number. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.
   - Swap this number with the smallest number that is larger than it to the right of it.
   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position to get the smallest possible order.

3. **Edge Case**:
   - If the permutation is the largest possible (i.e., in descending order), the next permutation is the smallest possible (i.e., in ascending order).

### Pseudocode

```
function next_permutation(perm):
    n = length of perm
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i >= 0:
        j = n - 1
        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
            j -= 1
        swap perm[i] and perm[j]
    reverse perm from i + 1 to end
    return perm

function process_permutations(N, K, permutations):
    results = []
    for perm in permutations:
        next_perm = next_permutation(perm)
        results.append(next_perm)
    return results
```

### Final Python Code

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    n = len(perm)
    i = n - 2
    # Find the first decreasing element from the end
    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i >= 0:
        j = n - 1
        # Find the element just larger than perm[i]
        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
            j -= 1
        # Swap them
        perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
    # Reverse the sequence from i+1 to end
    perm[i + 1:] = reversed(perm[i + 1:])
    return perm

        index += N

        results.append(" ".join(map(str, next_perm)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

process_permutations()
```

### Explanation

- **next_permutation**: This function finds the next lexicographic permutation by identifying the first decreasing element from the end, swapping it with the smallest larger element to its right, and then reversing the sequence to the right of the original position.
- **process_permutations**: This function reads input, processes each permutation using `next_permutation`, and outputs the results. It handles reading from standard input and writing to standard output.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] In this task, I tackled the problem of finding the next lexicographic permutation of a given sequence of numbers. The core concept here is understanding how permutations can be ordered lexicographically, similar to dictionary order, and how to efficiently find the next permutation in this order.

The key steps involved in solving this problem are:
1. Identifying the first pair of numbers from the end of the sequence where the earlier number is smaller than the later one. This indicates the point where the sequence can be increased.
2. Swapping this number with the smallest number that is larger than it to the right of it.
3. Reversing the sequence to the right of the original position to ensure the smallest possible order.

This approach efficiently finds the next permutation in O(N) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints.

The solution was implemented in Python, using standard input and output for handling multiple test cases. The function `next_permutation` encapsulates the logic for finding the next permutation, while `process_permutations` handles input parsing and output formatting.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation order and provided a practical application of algorithmic techniques for sequence manipulation. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem of finding the next lexicographic permutation, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is a well-known algorithm for generating the next permutation. Here are the key insights and steps that are useful for future reference:

### Key Steps in Finding the Next Permutation

1. **Identify the Pivot**:
   - Traverse the permutation from right to left to find the first pair where the earlier number is smaller than the later number. This is the pivot point where the order can be increased.

2. **Find the Successor**:
   - From the right end, find the smallest number that is larger than the pivot. This number will be swapped with the pivot to increase the permutation order minimally.

3. **Swap and Reverse**:
   - Swap the pivot with its successor.
   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the pivot to get the smallest possible order, ensuring the next permutation is the smallest lexicographic order greater than the current one.

### Comparison with the Official Solution

- **Efficiency**: Both solutions efficiently find the next permutation in O(N) time complexity, where N is the length of the permutation. This is optimal for this problem.
- **Implementation Details**: The official solution uses a slightly different approach to find the successor by iterating and comparing values, while my solution uses a straightforward swap and reverse method. Both achieve the same result.
- **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input, which is a good practice for handling large inputs and can be useful in competitive programming.

### Conclusion

The problem reinforces the understanding of the next permutation algorithm, which is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and useful in various applications, such as generating permutations and solving problems related to ordering and arrangement. The approach is efficient and straightforward, making it a valuable tool in algorithmic problem-solving.
