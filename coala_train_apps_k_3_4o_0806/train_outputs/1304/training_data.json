    "summary": "In this task, I tackled the problem of finding the next lexicographic permutation of a given sequence of numbers. The core concept here is understanding how permutations can be ordered lexicographically, similar to dictionary order, and how to efficiently find the next permutation in this order.\n\nThe key steps involved in solving this problem are:\n1. Identifying the first pair of numbers from the end of the sequence where the earlier number is smaller than the later one. This indicates the point where the sequence can be increased.\n2. Swapping this number with the smallest number that is larger than it to the right of it.\n3. Reversing the sequence to the right of the original position to ensure the smallest possible order.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the next permutation in O(N) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints.\n\nThe solution was implemented in Python, using standard input and output for handling multiple test cases. The function `next_permutation` encapsulates the logic for finding the next permutation, while `process_permutations` handles input parsing and output formatting.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of understanding permutation order and provided a practical application of algorithmic techniques for sequence manipulation. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem of finding the next lexicographic permutation, both my solution and the official solution follow a similar approach, which is a well-known algorithm for generating the next permutation. Here are the key insights and steps that are useful for future reference:\n\n### Key Steps in Finding the Next Permutation\n\n1. **Identify the Pivot**:\n   - Traverse the permutation from right to left to find the first pair where the earlier number is smaller than the later number. This is the pivot point where the order can be increased.\n\n2. **Find the Successor**:\n   - From the right end, find the smallest number that is larger than the pivot. This number will be swapped with the pivot to increase the permutation order minimally.\n\n3. **Swap and Reverse**:\n   - Swap the pivot with its successor.\n   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the pivot to get the smallest possible order, ensuring the next permutation is the smallest lexicographic order greater than the current one.\n\n### Comparison with the Official Solution\n\n- **Efficiency**: Both solutions efficiently find the next permutation in O(N) time complexity, where N is the length of the permutation. This is optimal for this problem.\n- **Implementation Details**: The official solution uses a slightly different approach to find the successor by iterating and comparing values, while my solution uses a straightforward swap and reverse method. Both achieve the same result.\n- **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input, which is a good practice for handling large inputs and can be useful in competitive programming.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe problem reinforces the understanding of the next permutation algorithm, which is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and useful in various applications, such as generating permutations and solving problems related to ordering and arrangement. The approach is efficient and straightforward, making it a valuable tool in algorithmic problem-solving.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: process_permutations]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which includes two integers, N and K, followed by K permutations of N integers each. It processes each permutation to find its next lexicographical permutation and stores the results. After processing all permutations, it prints each resulting permutation on a new line. The function uses a helper to compute the next permutation for each input permutation.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to generate permutations in lexicographic order, particularly when dealing with problems in combinatorics, algorithm design, or competitive programming. Understanding how to find the next permutation in lexicographic order is crucial for tasks that require iterating through permutations efficiently without generating all permutations at once. This can be applied in optimization problems, scheduling, and any situation where permutations need to be processed in a specific order. The algorithm is also a fundamental concept in computer science education, often used to teach algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills."
