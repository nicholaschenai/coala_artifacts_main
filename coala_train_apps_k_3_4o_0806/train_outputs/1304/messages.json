However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.\nHowever, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:\n123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \\, 2 \\, 3 \\quad    1 \\, 3 \\, 2 \\quad     2 \\, 1 \\, 3 \\quad     2 \\, 3 \\, 1 \\quad     3 \\, 1 \\, 2 \\quad     3 \\, 2 \\, 1 \nThe problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, \u2026, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,\u2026,N$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$.\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 10$.\n\n-----Sample input-----\n3 2\n3 1 2\n2 3 1\n\n-----Sample output-----\n3 2 1\n3 1 2\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Our task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order for each of these `K` permutations and output them.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in the order they would appear if sorted.\n\n2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:\n   - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair of consecutive elements where the earlier element is smaller than the later one. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.\n   - Swap this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger than it.\n   - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position of the first element to get the smallest possible order.\n\n3. **Edge Case**: If the permutation is the last in lexicographic order (i.e., sorted in descending order), the next permutation is the first permutation (i.e., sorted in ascending order).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction next_permutation(perm):\n    n = length of perm\n    i = n - 2\n    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    if i == -1:\n        reverse perm from start to end\n        return perm\n    j = n - 1\n    while perm[j] <= perm[i]:\n        j -= 1\n    swap perm[i] and perm[j]\n    reverse perm from i + 1 to end\n    return perm\n\nread N, K\nfor each permutation in input:\n    result = next_permutation(permutation)\n    print result\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef next_permutation(perm):\n    n = len(perm)\n    i = n - 2\n    \n    # Find the first decreasing element from the end\n    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    \n    if i == -1:\n        # If no such element is found, the permutation is the last one\n        perm.reverse()\n    else:\n        # Find the smallest element larger than perm[i] to the right of i\n        j = n - 1\n        while perm[j] <= perm[i]:\n            j -= 1\n        # Swap elements at i and j\n        perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]\n        # Reverse the sequence from i+1 to end to get the next permutation\n        perm[i + 1:] = reversed(perm[i + 1:])\n    \n    return perm\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    K = int(data[1])\n    \n    index = 2\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(K):\n        permutation = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n        index += N\n        next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)\n        results.append(' '.join(map(str, next_perm)))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code reads input from standard input, processes each permutation to find its next lexicographic permutation, and prints the results. The `next_permutation` function implements the logic to find the next permutation as described in the conceptual solution."

If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n        1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:\n           \\[\n           f(P) = \\max(p_1, p_2) + \\max(p_2, p_3) + \\ldots + \\max(p_{N-1}, p_N)\n           \\]\n\n        2. **Constraints and Observations**:\n           - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.\n           - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \\(\\frac{N \\times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\\).\n\n        3. **Approach**:\n           - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.\n           - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.\n\n        4. **Constructing the Permutation**:\n           - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.\n           - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n        ```\n        function find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n            for each (N, K) in test_cases:\n                if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:\n                    output -1\n                else:\n                    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]\n                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1\n                    i = 0\n                    while current_sum > K:\n                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i+1]:\n                            swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]\n                            current_sum -= 1\n                        i += 1\n                    output permutation\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                if K < N - 1 or K > (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n                    i = 0\n                    while current_sum > K:\n                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                            current_sum -= 1\n                        i += 1\n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n        - We start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum.\n        - We then iteratively swap adjacent elements to reduce the sum until it matches K.\n        - This approach ensures that we efficiently find a permutation that satisfies the condition or determine that it's impossible.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['3', '4 12', '2 2', '5 14'] Expected output: [{'-1'}, {'1', '2'}, {'5', '1', '3', '4', '2'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.
