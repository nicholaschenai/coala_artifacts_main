    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nRyan is in a country with `N` cities connected by `M` bidirectional roads. He starts in city 1 and has `K` seconds to move between cities. Each second, he can move to an adjacent city or stay in the current city. Ryan has `Q` conditions specifying that he must be in city `a_i` after exactly `b_i` seconds. We need to determine how many different trips Ryan can make that satisfy all conditions, modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each city at each second.\n\n3. **Initial State**: Start with Ryan in city 1 at time 0.\n\n4. **Transition**: For each second, update the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach its adjacent cities in the previous second.\n\n5. **Condition Checking**: Ensure that the conditions `(a_i, b_i)` are satisfied by checking if the number of ways to be in city `a_i` at time `b_i` is non-zero.\n\n6. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, compute the number of trips modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_trips(T, test_cases):\n    MOD = 10^9 + 7\n    results = []\n    \n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, M, K = test_case['N'], test_case['M'], test_case['K']\n        roads = test_case['roads']\n        Q = test_case['Q']\n        conditions = test_case['conditions']\n        \n        # Initialize adjacency list for the graph\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n        for u, v in roads:\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        # Initialize DP table\n        dp = [[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]\n        dp[1][0] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n        \n        # Fill DP table\n        for time in range(K):\n            for city in range(1, N + 1):\n                if dp[city][time] > 0:\n                    # Stay in the same city\n                    dp[city][time + 1] = (dp[city][time + 1] + dp[city][time]) % MOD\n                    # Move to adjacent cities\n                    for neighbor in graph[city]:\n                        dp[neighbor][time + 1] = (dp[neighbor][time + 1] + dp[city][time]) % MOD\n        \n        # Check conditions\n        valid_trip_count = 1\n        for a_i, b_i in conditions:\n            valid_trip_count = (valid_trip_count * dp[a_i][b_i]) % MOD\n        \n        results.append(valid_trip_count)\n    \n    return results\n```\n\n## Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef count_trips(T, test_cases):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    results = []\n    \n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, M, K = test_case['N'], test_case['M'], test_case['K']\n        roads = test_case['roads']\n        Q = test_case['Q']\n        conditions = test_case['conditions']\n        \n        # Initialize adjacency list for the graph\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n        for u, v in roads:\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        # Initialize DP table\n        dp = [[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]\n        dp[1][0] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n        \n        # Fill DP table\n        for time in range(K):\n            for city in range(1, N + 1):\n                if dp[city][time] > 0:\n                    # Stay in the same city\n                    dp[city][time + 1] = (dp[city][time + 1] + dp[city][time]) % MOD\n                    # Move to adjacent cities\n                    for neighbor in graph[city]:\n                        dp[neighbor][time + 1] = (dp[neighbor][time + 1] + dp[city][time]) % MOD\n        \n        # Check conditions\n        valid_trip_count = 1\n        for a_i, b_i in conditions:\n            valid_trip_count = (valid_trip_count * dp[a_i][b_i]) % MOD\n        \n        results.append(valid_trip_count)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# T = number of test cases\n# test_cases = list of dictionaries, each containing N, M, K, roads, Q, and conditions\n# result = count_trips(T, test_cases)\n# print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\nThis code efficiently calculates the number of valid trips for each test case using dynamic programming and graph traversal, ensuring that all conditions are met.",
