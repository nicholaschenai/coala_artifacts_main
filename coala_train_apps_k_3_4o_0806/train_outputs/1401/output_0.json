    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\nAnushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a limited amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price. Given a list of chocolate prices and the total amount of money Anushka has, determine the maximum number of chocolates she can buy without exceeding her budget.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\nTo maximize the number of chocolates Anushka can buy, she should start by purchasing the cheapest chocolates first. This way, she can buy more chocolates before her money runs out. The steps are:\n- Sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order.\n- Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of chocolates bought.\n- Iterate through the sorted list, subtracting each chocolate's price from the total money Anushka has.\n- Stop when the next chocolate's price exceeds the remaining money.\n- The counter will then represent the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n```\nfunction maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n    sort prices in ascending order\n    count = 0\n    for each price in prices:\n        if k >= price:\n            k = k - price\n            count = count + 1\n        else:\n            break\n    return count\n```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n    # Sort the prices in ascending order to buy cheaper chocolates first\n    prices.sort()\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for the number of chocolates bought\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the sorted prices\n    for price in prices:\n        # Check if the current chocolate can be bought with the remaining money\n        if k >= price:\n            # Deduct the price from the remaining money\n            k -= price\n            # Increment the count of chocolates bought\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            # If the current chocolate cannot be bought, stop the process\n            break\n    \n    # Return the total number of chocolates bought\n    return count\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently determines the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy by prioritizing cheaper chocolates, ensuring the budget is utilized optimally.",
