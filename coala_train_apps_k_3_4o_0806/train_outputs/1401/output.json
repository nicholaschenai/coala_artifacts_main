    "raw_msg": "Let's fix the solution by ensuring it reads from standard input and writes to standard output correctly. Here's the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef maxChocolates(n, k, prices):\n    # Sort the prices in ascending order to buy cheaper chocolates first\n    prices.sort()\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for the number of chocolates bought\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the sorted prices\n    for price in prices:\n        # Check if the current chocolate can be bought with the remaining money\n        if k >= price:\n            # Deduct the price from the remaining money\n            k -= price\n            # Increment the count of chocolates bought\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            # If the current chocolate cannot be bought, stop the process\n            break\n    \n    # Return the total number of chocolates bought\n    return count\n\n# Read input from standard input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse the input\nn = int(data[0])\nk = int(data[1])\nprices = list(map(int, data[2:]))\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = maxChocolates(n, k, prices)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Handling:** The code reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.\n- **Parsing:** The first two elements are parsed as integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of chocolates and the amount of money Anushka has, respectively. The remaining elements are parsed as a list of integers representing the prices of the chocolates.\n- **Function Call:** The `maxChocolates` function is called with the parsed inputs, and the result is printed to standard output. \n\nThis solution should now correctly handle input and output in the expected format for the testing environment.",
