The expression may include:\n- Non-negative integers\n- The plus `+` and minus `-` operators\n- Parentheses `(` and `)`\n- Spaces, which should be ignored\n\nThe expression is always valid, and we cannot use Python's `eval` function.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a stack to handle the parentheses and maintain the current result and sign. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**: \n   - A stack to keep track of results and signs when encountering parentheses.\n   - A variable `result` to store the current result.\n   - A variable `sign` to store the current sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n   - A variable `i` to iterate through the string.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String**:\n   - If the character is a digit, parse the full number and update the result using the current sign.\n   - If the character is a `+`, set the sign to 1.\n   - If the character is a `-`, set the sign to -1.\n   - If the character is `(`, push the current result and sign onto the stack, then reset `result` to 0 and `sign` to 1.\n   - If the character is `)`, pop the sign and previous result from the stack, and update the current result accordingly.\n   - Ignore spaces.\n\n3. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters, the `result` will contain the evaluated value of the expression.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate(s):\n    initialize stack as empty\n    initialize result as 0\n    initialize sign as 1\n    initialize i as 0\n\n    while i < length of s:\n        if s[i] is a digit:\n            initialize num as 0\n            while i < length of s and s[i] is a digit:\n                num = num * 10 + int(s[i])\n                increment i\n            decrement i\n            result += sign * num\n        else if s[i] is '+':\n            sign = 1\n        else if s[i] is '-':\n            sign = -1\n        else if s[i] is '(':\n            push result onto stack\n            push sign onto stack\n            result = 0\n            sign = 1\n        else if s[i] is ')':\n            pop sign from stack\n            pop previous_result from stack\n            result = previous_result + sign * result\n        increment i\n\n    return result\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize a stack to handle parentheses\n        stack = []\n        # Initialize the current result and sign\n        result = 0\n        sign = 1\n        i = 0\n        \n        while i < len(s):\n            char = s[i]\n            \n            if char.isdigit():\n                # If the character is a digit, parse the full number\n                num = 0\n                while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():\n                    num = num * 10 + int(s[i])\n                    i += 1\n                # Adjust for the last increment in the loop\n                i -= 1\n                # Update the result with the current number and sign\n                result += sign * num\n            \n            elif char == '+':\n                # Set the sign to positive\n                sign = 1\n            \n            elif char == '-':\n                # Set the sign to negative\n                sign = -1\n            \n            elif char == '(':\n                # Push the current result and sign onto the stack\n                stack.append(result)\n                stack.append(sign)\n                # Reset result and sign for the new sub-expression\n                result = 0\n                sign = 1\n            \n            elif char == ')':\n                # Pop the sign and previous result from the stack\n                prev_sign = stack.pop()\n                prev_result = stack.pop()\n                # Update the result with the evaluated sub-expression\n                result = prev_result + prev_sign * result\n            \n            # Move to the next character\n            i += 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n"

st.pop();\n        int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n        switch (op) {\n            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;\n            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;\n            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;\n            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int evaluate(string& s) {\n        stack<int> st;\n        stack<char> op;\n        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {\n            if (delim(s[i]))\n                continue;\n        \n            if (s[i] == '(') {\n                op.push('(');\n            } else if (s[i] == ')') {\n                while (op.top() != '(') {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.pop();\n            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {\n                char cur_op = s[i];\n                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.push(cur_op);\n            } else {\n                int number = 0;\n                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))\n                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';\n                --i;\n                st.push(number);\n            }\n        }\n\n        while (!op.empty()) {\n            process_op(st, op.top());\n            op.pop();\n        }\n        return st.top();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.\n    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.\n\n    ## Unary operators\n\n    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).\n    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.\n\n    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.\n\n    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).\n    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.\n    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. \n\n    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.\n    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.\n\n    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.\n\n    ## Right-associativity\n\n    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.\n\n    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.\n    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \\wedge b \\wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).\n\n    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?\n    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.\n    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.\n\n    The only line that needs to be replaced is\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))\n    ```\n    with\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && (\n            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||\n            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))\n        ))\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Expression parsing\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n    where `left_assoc` is a function that decides if an operator is left_associative or not.\n\n    Here is an implementation for the binary operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$ and the unary  operators $+$ and $-$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_unary}\n    bool delim(char c) {\n        return c == ' ';\n    }\n\n    bool is_op(char c) {\n        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';\n    }\n\n    bool is_unary(char c) {\n        return c == '+' || c=='-';\n    }\n\n    int priority (char op) {\n        if (op < 0) // unary operator\n            return 3;\n        if (op == '+' || op == '-')\n            return 1;\n        if (op == '*' || op == '/')\n            return 2;\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {\n        if (op < 0) {\n            int l = st.top();

        "content": "In this task, I implemented a basic calculator to evaluate arithmetic expressions containing non-negative integers, the operators `+` and `-`, and parentheses. The core concept was to use a stack to manage nested expressions and handle the order of operations correctly. The stack was used to store intermediate results and signs when encountering parentheses, allowing us to evaluate sub-expressions independently.\n\nThe main strategy involved iterating through the string and processing each character based on its type (digit, operator, parenthesis, or space). For digits, I built the complete number by considering multiple digits. For operators, I applied the current sign to the number and updated the result. Parentheses required pushing the current state onto the stack and resetting for the new sub-expression. Spaces were ignored.\n\nThis approach worked effectively, and the solution passed all tests. The key takeaway is the use of a stack to handle nested expressions and maintain the correct order of operations, which is a common pattern in parsing and evaluating expressions. This problem reinforced the importance of managing state and context when dealing with nested structures in programming."

Both solutions effectively use a stack to manage nested expressions and handle the arithmetic operations by iterating through the string character by character.\n\nKey insights from the official solution include:\n\n1. **Handling Digits and Numbers**: Both solutions correctly build numbers from consecutive digits. The official solution uses `ord(c) - ord('0')` to convert characters to integers, which is a more explicit way to handle character-to-integer conversion compared to using `int(char)`.\n\n2. **Use of Stack for Parentheses**: The stack is used to store the current result and sign before entering a new sub-expression within parentheses. This allows the solution to correctly evaluate nested expressions by restoring the previous state after evaluating the sub-expression.\n\n3. **Sign Management**: The solutions manage the current sign using a simple integer (`1` for positive and `-1` for negative), which is updated whenever a `+` or `-` is encountered. This approach is efficient and straightforward.\n\n4. **Final Result Calculation**: Both solutions ensure that any remaining number is added to the result after the loop, which handles cases where the expression ends with a number.\n\nOverall, the problem was straightforward, and the official solution aligns well with the approach I took.

        "content": "\n[description]\nThe function evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string, which may include non-negative integers, '+', '-', '(', and ')' characters. It uses a stack to handle nested expressions within parentheses, maintaining the current result and sign for each sub-expression. As it iterates through the string, it constructs numbers from consecutive digits and applies the current sign to update the result when encountering '+' or '-' operators. When encountering '(', it saves the current result and sign on the stack, resetting them for the new sub-expression, and when encountering ')', it completes the current sub-expression, applies the saved sign, and adds it to the saved result. Finally, it returns the computed result of the entire expression.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to evaluate mathematical expressions programmatically without using built-in functions like eval, which can be unsafe or restricted in certain environments. It is particularly relevant in developing custom parsers or interpreters for simple arithmetic expressions, such as in educational software, calculators, or any application that requires parsing and evaluating user input expressions. Understanding how to handle operator precedence, parentheses, and maintaining state with a stack is crucial for implementing more complex expression evaluators or compilers."
