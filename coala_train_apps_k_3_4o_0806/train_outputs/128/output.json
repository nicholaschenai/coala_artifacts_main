    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a calculator that can evaluate a string expression containing non-negative integers, the operators `+` and `-`, and parentheses. The expression may also contain spaces, which should be ignored. The goal is to compute the result of the expression without using the built-in `eval` function.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will use a stack to handle the operations and parentheses.\n   - As we iterate through the string:\n     - If we encounter a digit, we will build the complete number (since numbers can have multiple digits).\n     - If we encounter a `+` or `-`, we will apply the current sign to the number and add it to the result. We will also update the current sign for the next number.\n     - If we encounter a `(`, we will push the current result and sign onto the stack and reset them for the new sub-expression.\n     - If we encounter a `)`, we will complete the current sub-expression, pop the previous result and sign from the stack, and combine them.\n     - Spaces will be ignored.\n   - At the end of the iteration, the result will contain the evaluated value of the expression.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function calculate(s):\n       Initialize stack to store results and signs\n       Initialize result to 0\n       Initialize current number to 0\n       Initialize sign to 1 (positive)\n\n       for each character in s:\n           if character is a digit:\n               Update current number\n           else if character is '+':\n               Add current number * sign to result\n               Reset current number\n               Set sign to 1\n           else if character is '-':\n               Add current number * sign to result\n               Reset current number\n               Set sign to -1\n           else if character is '(':\n               Push current result and sign onto stack\n               Reset result and sign\n           else if character is ')':\n               Add current number * sign to result\n               Pop sign from stack and multiply result\n               Pop previous result from stack and add to result\n               Reset current number\n           else if character is a space:\n               Continue\n\n       Add any remaining number * sign to result\n       Return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize a stack to keep track of results and signs\n        stack = []\n        # This will hold the current result of the expression\n        result = 0\n        # This will hold the current number being processed\n        current_number = 0\n        # This will hold the current sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative)\n        sign = 1\n\n        # Iterate over each character in the input string\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                # If the character is a digit, update the current number\n                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)\n            elif char == '+':\n                # If the character is '+', add the current number to the result with the current sign\n                result += sign * current_number\n                # Reset the current number\n                current_number = 0\n                # Set the sign to positive\n                sign = 1\n            elif char == '-':\n                # If the character is '-', add the current number to the result with the current sign\n                result += sign * current_number\n                # Reset the current number\n                current_number = 0\n                # Set the sign to negative\n                sign = -1\n            elif char == '(':\n                # If the character is '(', push the current result and sign onto the stack\n                stack.append(result)\n                stack.append(sign)\n                # Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression\n                result = 0\n                sign = 1\n            elif char == ')':\n                # If the character is ')', add the current number to the result with the current sign\n                result += sign * current_number\n                # Reset the current number\n                current_number = 0\n                # Pop the sign from the stack and multiply the result\n                result *= stack.pop()\n                # Pop the previous result from the stack and add to the result\n                result += stack.pop()\n\n        # Add any remaining number to the result\n        result += sign * current_number\n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution uses a stack to manage nested expressions and evaluates the expression by processing each character in the input string.",
