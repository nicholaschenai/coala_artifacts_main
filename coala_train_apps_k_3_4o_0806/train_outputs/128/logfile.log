INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to implement a basic calculator that can evaluate a simple arithmetic expression given as a string. The expression may include:
- Non-negative integers
- The plus `+` and minus `-` operators
- Parentheses `(` and `)`
- Spaces, which should be ignored

The expression is always valid, and we cannot use Python's `eval` function.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a stack to handle the parentheses and maintain the current result and sign. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize Variables**: 
   - A stack to keep track of results and signs when encountering parentheses.
   - A variable `result` to store the current result.
   - A variable `sign` to store the current sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative).
   - A variable `i` to iterate through the string.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - If the character is a digit, parse the full number and update the result using the current sign.
   - If the character is a `+`, set the sign to 1.
   - If the character is a `-`, set the sign to -1.
   - If the character is `(`, push the current result and sign onto the stack, then reset `result` to 0 and `sign` to 1.
   - If the character is `)`, pop the sign and previous result from the stack, and update the current result accordingly.
   - Ignore spaces.

3. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters, the `result` will contain the evaluated value of the expression.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate(s):
    initialize stack as empty
    initialize result as 0
    initialize sign as 1
    initialize i as 0

    while i < length of s:
        if s[i] is a digit:
            initialize num as 0
            while i < length of s and s[i] is a digit:
                num = num * 10 + int(s[i])
                increment i
            decrement i
            result += sign * num
        else if s[i] is '+':
            sign = 1
        else if s[i] is '-':
            sign = -1
        else if s[i] is '(':
            push result onto stack
            push sign onto stack
            result = 0
            sign = 1
        else if s[i] is ')':
            pop sign from stack
            pop previous_result from stack
            result = previous_result + sign * result
        increment i

    return result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Initialize a stack to handle parentheses
        stack = []
        # Initialize the current result and sign
        result = 0
        sign = 1
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            char = s[i]
            
            if char.isdigit():
                # If the character is a digit, parse the full number
                num = 0
                while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():
                    num = num * 10 + int(s[i])
                    i += 1
                # Adjust for the last increment in the loop
                i -= 1
                # Update the result with the current number and sign
                result += sign * num
            
            elif char == '+':
                # Set the sign to positive
                sign = 1
            
            elif char == '-':

            elif char == '(':
                # Push the current result and sign onto the stack
                stack.append(result)
                stack.append(sign)
                # Reset result and sign for the new sub-expression
                result = 0
                sign = 1
            
            elif char == ')':

                # Update the result with the evaluated sub-expression
                result = prev_result + prev_sign * result
            
            # Move to the next character
            i += 1
        
        return result

    Title: Expression parsing
    Part: 1/2
    # Expression parsing

    A string containing a mathematical expression containing numbers and various operators is given.
    We have to compute the value of it in $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.

    The algorithm discussed here translates an expression into the so-called **reverse Polish notation** (explicitly or implicitly), and evaluates this expression.

    ## Reverse Polish notation

    The reverse Polish notation is a form of writing mathematical expressions, in which the operators are located after their operands.
    For example the following expression

    $$a + b * c * d + (e - f) * (g * h + i)$$

    can be written in reverse Polish notation in the following way:

    $$a b c * d * + e f - g h * i + * +$$

    The reverse Polish notation was developed by the Australian philosopher and computer science specialist Charles Hamblin in the mid 1950s on the basis of the Polish notation, which was proposed in 1920 by the Polish mathematician Jan Åukasiewicz.

    The convenience of the reverse Polish notation is, that expressions in this form are very **easy to evaluate** in linear time.
    We use a stack, which is initially empty.
    We will iterate over the operands and operators of the expression in reverse Polish notation.
    If the current element is a number, then we put the value on top of the stack, if the current element is an operator, then we get the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and put the result back on top of the stack.
    In the end there will be exactly one element left in the stack, which will be the value of the expression.

    Obviously this simple evaluation runs in $O(n)$ time.

    ## Parsing of simple expressions

    For the time being we only consider a simplified problem:
    we assume that all operators are **binary** (i.e. they take two arguments), and all are **left-associative** (if the priorities are equal, they get executed from left to right).
    Parentheses are allowed.

    We will set up two stacks: one for numbers, and one for operators and parentheses.
    Initially both stacks are empty.
    For the second stack we will maintain the condition that all operations are ordered by strict descending priority.
    If there are parenthesis on the stack, than each block of operators (corresponding to one pair of parenthesis) is ordered, and the entire stack is not necessarily ordered.

    We will iterate over the characters of the expression from left to right.
    If the current character is a digit, then we put the value of this number on the stack.
    If the current character is an opening parenthesis, then we put it on the stack.
    If the current character is a closing parenthesis, the we execute all operators on the stack until we reach the opening bracket (in other words we perform all operations inside the parenthesis).
    Finally if the current character is an operator, then while the top of the stack has an operator with the same or higher priority, we will execute this operation, and put the new operation on the stack.

    After we processed the entire string, some operators might still be in the stack, so we execute them.

    Here is the implementation of this method for the four operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$:

    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_simple}
    bool delim(char c) {
        return c == ' ';
    }

    bool is_op(char c) {
        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';
    }

    int priority (char op) {
        if (op == '+' || op == '-')
            return 1;
        if (op == '*' || op == '/')
            return 2;
        return -1;
    }

    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {
        int r = st.top(); st.pop();
        int l = st.top(); st.pop();
        switch (op) {
            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;
            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;
            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;
            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;
        }
    }

    int evaluate(string& s) {
        stack<int> st;
        stack<char> op;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {
            if (delim(s[i]))
                continue;
        
            if (s[i] == '(') {
                op.push('(');
            } else if (s[i] == ')') {
                while (op.top() != '(') {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.pop();
            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {
                char cur_op = s[i];
                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.push(cur_op);
            } else {
                int number = 0;
                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))
                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';
                --i;
                st.push(number);
            }
        }

        while (!op.empty()) {
            process_op(st, op.top());
            op.pop();
        }
        return st.top();
    }
    ```

    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.
    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.

    ## Unary operators

    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).
    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.

    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.

    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).
    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.
    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. 

    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.
    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.

    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.

    ## Right-associativity

    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.

    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.
    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \wedge b \wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).

    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?
    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.
    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.

    The only line that needs to be replaced is
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))
    ```
    with
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && (
            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||
            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))
        ))

    [Task]:
        Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


        The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


        You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

        Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


        Examples:

        s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
        s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
        s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a string that is encoded using a specific pattern: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a string that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns into their repeated forms.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           - We will use a stack to help decode the string. The stack will help us manage nested patterns.
           - As we iterate through the string:
             - If we encounter a digit, it indicates the start of a new pattern. We will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.
             - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it marks the start of an encoded string. We push it onto the stack to signify this.
             - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded string. We will pop elements from the stack until we find the matching `[`, then repeat the string the number of times specified by the number before the `[`.
             - If we encounter a letter, we add it to the current string being built.
           - Finally, the stack will contain the fully decoded string.

        3. **Pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function decodeString(s):
               stack = []
               current_string = ""
               current_number = 0

               for each character in s:
                   if character is a digit:
                       update current_number to include this digit
                   else if character is '[':
                       push current_string and current_number onto the stack
                       reset current_string and current_number
                   else if character is ']':
                       pop number from stack
                       pop previous_string from stack
                       current_string = previous_string + (current_string repeated number times)
                   else:
                       add character to current_string

               return current_string
           ```

                        previous_string, number = stack.pop()
                        # Repeat the current string 'number' times and append to the previous string
                        current_string = previous_string + current_string * number

INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a calculator that can evaluate a string expression containing non-negative integers, the operators `+` and `-`, and parentheses. The expression may also contain spaces, which should be ignored. The goal is to compute the result of the expression without using the built-in `eval` function.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will use a stack to handle the operations and parentheses.
   - As we iterate through the string:
     - If we encounter a digit, we will build the complete number (since numbers can have multiple digits).
     - If we encounter a `+` or `-`, we will apply the current sign to the number and add it to the result. We will also update the current sign for the next number.
     - If we encounter a `(`, we will push the current result and sign onto the stack and reset them for the new sub-expression.
     - If we encounter a `)`, we will complete the current sub-expression, pop the previous result and sign from the stack, and combine them.
     - Spaces will be ignored.
   - At the end of the iteration, the result will contain the evaluated value of the expression.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function calculate(s):

           else if character is '+':
               Add current number * sign to result
               Reset current number

INFO - [Task id] 128 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a calculator that can evaluate a string expression containing non-negative integers, the operators `+` and `-`, and parentheses. The expression may also contain spaces, which should be ignored. The goal is to compute the result of the expression without using the built-in `eval` function.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will use a stack to handle the operations and parentheses.
   - As we iterate through the string:
     - If we encounter a digit, we will build the complete number (since numbers can have multiple digits).
     - If we encounter a `+` or `-`, we will apply the current sign to the number and add it to the result. We will also update the current sign for the next number.
     - If we encounter a `(`, we will push the current result and sign onto the stack and reset them for the new sub-expression.
     - If we encounter a `)`, we will complete the current sub-expression, pop the previous result and sign from the stack, and combine them.
     - Spaces will be ignored.
   - At the end of the iteration, the result will contain the evaluated value of the expression.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function calculate(s):
       Initialize stack to store results and signs
       Initialize result to 0
       Initialize current number to 0
       Initialize sign to 1 (positive)

           else if character is '+':
               Add current number * sign to result
               Reset current number
               Set sign to 1
           else if character is '-':
               Add current number * sign to result

## Instructions
Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] In this task, I implemented a basic calculator to evaluate arithmetic expressions containing non-negative integers, the operators `+` and `-`, and parentheses. The core concept was to use a stack to manage nested expressions and handle the order of operations correctly. The stack was used to store intermediate results and signs when encountering parentheses, allowing us to evaluate sub-expressions independently.

The main strategy involved iterating through the string and processing each character based on its type (digit, operator, parenthesis, or space). For digits, I built the complete number by considering multiple digits. For operators, I applied the current sign to the number and updated the result. Parentheses required pushing the current state onto the stack and resetting for the new sub-expression. Spaces were ignored.

This approach worked effectively, and the solution passed all tests. The key takeaway is the use of a stack to handle nested expressions and maintain the correct order of operations, which is a common pattern in parsing and evaluating expressions. This problem reinforced the importance of managing state and context when dealing with nested structures in programming.

INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this basic calculator task, the approach I took was quite similar to the official solution, which indicates a solid understanding of the problem. Both solutions effectively use a stack to manage nested expressions and handle the arithmetic operations by iterating through the string character by character.

Key insights from the official solution include:

1. **Handling Digits and Numbers**: Both solutions correctly build numbers from consecutive digits. The official solution uses `ord(c) - ord('0')` to convert characters to integers, which is a more explicit way to handle character-to-integer conversion compared to using `int(char)`.

2. **Use of Stack for Parentheses**: The stack is used to store the current result and sign before entering a new sub-expression within parentheses. This allows the solution to correctly evaluate nested expressions by restoring the previous state after evaluating the sub-expression.

3. **Sign Management**: The solutions manage the current sign using a simple integer (`1` for positive and `-1` for negative), which is updated whenever a `+` or `-` is encountered. This approach is efficient and straightforward.

4. **Final Result Calculation**: Both solutions ensure that any remaining number is added to the result after the loop, which handles cases where the expression ends with a number.

Overall, the problem was straightforward, and the official solution aligns well with the approach I took. The key takeaway is the effective use of a stack to manage nested expressions and the importance of handling each character type (digit, operator, parenthesis) appropriately to evaluate the expression correctly.

INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] The function evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string, which may include non-negative integers, '+', '-', '(', and ')' characters. It uses a stack to handle nested expressions within parentheses, maintaining the current result and sign for each sub-expression. As it iterates through the string, it constructs numbers from consecutive digits and applies the current sign to update the result when encountering '+' or '-' operators. When encountering '(', it saves the current result and sign on the stack, resetting them for the new sub-expression, and when encountering ')', it completes the current sub-expression, applies the saved sign, and adds it to the saved result. Finally, it returns the computed result of the entire expression.
