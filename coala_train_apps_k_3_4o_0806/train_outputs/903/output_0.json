    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile through the mirror. Given the coordinates of Kabir and Tara, we need to calculate this x-coordinate for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The mirror should be placed such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This means the mirror should be placed at the midpoint of the x-coordinates of Kabir and Tara when projected onto the x-axis. The formula for the x-coordinate of the mirror is derived from the line equation that passes through both points and reflects off the x-axis.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   For each test case:\n       Read the coordinates (x1, y1) for Kabir\n       Read the coordinates (x2, y2) for Tara\n       Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the formula:\n           x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)\n       Print the x-coordinate of the mirror with a precision of two decimal places\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mirror_position():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read Kabir's coordinates\n        x1 = int(data[index])\n        y1 = int(data[index + 1])\n        # Read Tara's coordinates\n        x2 = int(data[index + 2])\n        y2 = int(data[index + 3])\n        \n        # Move to the next set of coordinates\n        index += 4\n        \n        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror\n        x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)\n        \n        # Store the result formatted to two decimal places\n        results.append(f\"{x_mirror:.2f}\")\n    \n    # Print all results, each on a new line\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code reads input for multiple test cases, calculates the x-coordinate of the mirror for each case using the formula derived from the line equation, and outputs the result with a precision of two decimal places.",
