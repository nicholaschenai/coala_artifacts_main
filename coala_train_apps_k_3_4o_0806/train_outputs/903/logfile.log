INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

Kabir wants to see Tara's smile using a mirror placed on the x-axis. Given the coordinates of Kabir and Tara, we need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where the mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The solution should be accurate to within an absolute error of 0.01.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Reflection**: The mirror should be placed such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This means the path from Kabir to the mirror and from the mirror to Tara should be symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

2. **Geometric Insight**: The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula derived from the symmetry of the triangle formed by Kabir, Tara, and the mirror. The formula is:
   \[
   x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that the distances from Kabir to the mirror and from the mirror to Tara are proportional to their respective y-coordinates.

3. **Iterate for Multiple Test Cases**: Since there can be multiple test cases, we need to repeat the calculation for each pair of coordinates provided.

## Pseudocode

```
function calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

read T  # number of test cases
for each test case:
    read x1, y1
    read x2, y2
    mirror_x = calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    print mirror_x formatted to 2 decimal places
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the derived formula
    return (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])  # number of test cases
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        x2 = int(data[index + 2])
        y2 = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        
        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror
        mirror_x = calculate_mirror_x(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        
        # Store the result formatted to 2 decimal places
        results.append(f"{mirror_x:.2f}")
    
    # Print all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads input for multiple test cases, calculates the x-coordinate of the mirror for each case using the derived formula, and prints the result formatted to two decimal places.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that encloses a set of points on a 2D plane, with one side having a specified slope M. The core concept involved transforming the coordinate system to align with the slope M, which required understanding and applying a rotation transformation.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Coordinate Transformation**: The problem required transforming the coordinate system using a rotation matrix. This was necessary to align one axis with the slope M, allowing for the calculation of a bounding box in the transformed space.
    - **Bounding Box Calculation**: After transforming the coordinates, the minimum and maximum values in the new coordinate system were used to determine the bounding box, which directly influenced the perimeter calculation.

    ### Strategies and Fixes:
    - **Initial Mistake**: The initial approach incorrectly transformed the coordinates, leading to incorrect bounding box calculations. The transformation equations were not properly derived from the slope M.
    - **Correct Approach**: By using the angle Î¸ derived from `atan(M)`, the correct rotation matrix was applied, allowing for accurate transformation and bounding box determination.
    - **Handling Edge Cases**: Special handling was required for the case when M = 0, where the rectangle is axis-aligned, simplifying the bounding box calculation.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)

    for (x, y) in points:
        x_prime = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta
        y_prime = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
        # Update min/max x' and y' for bounding box
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly applying geometric transformations and understanding their implications on problem constraints. The solution also highlighted the need to handle special cases separately to ensure accuracy.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

    Title: Circle-Circle Intersection
    Part: 1/1
    # Circle-Circle Intersection

    You are given two circles on a 2D plane, each one described as coordinates of its center and its radius. Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).

    ## Solution

    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).

    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$

    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$x \cdot (-2x_2) + y \cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$

    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:

    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$

    $$\begin{align}
    A &= -2x_2 \\
    B &= -2y_2 \\
    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2
    \end{align}$$

    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).

    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile through the mirror. Given the coordinates of Kabir and Tara, we need to calculate this x-coordinate for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The mirror should be placed such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This means the mirror should be placed at the midpoint of the x-coordinates of Kabir and Tara when projected onto the x-axis. The formula for the x-coordinate of the mirror is derived from the line equation that passes through both points and reflects off the x-axis.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   For each test case:
       Read the coordinates (x1, y1) for Kabir
       Read the coordinates (x2, y2) for Tara
       Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the formula:
           x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
       Print the x-coordinate of the mirror with a precision of two decimal places
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile through the mirror. Given the coordinates of Kabir and Tara, we need to calculate this x-coordinate for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The mirror should be placed such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This means the mirror should be placed at the midpoint of the x-coordinates of Kabir and Tara when projected onto the x-axis. The formula for the x-coordinate of the mirror is derived from the line equation that passes through both points and reflects off the x-axis.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   For each test case:
       Read the coordinates (x1, y1) for Kabir
       Read the coordinates (x2, y2) for Tara
       Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the formula:
           x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
       Print the x-coordinate of the mirror with a precision of two decimal places
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and splits it into a list of strings. This is generally correct for competitive programming, but it seems the function `calculate_mirror_position()` is not being called, which means the code isn't executing.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The function `calculate_mirror_position()` is defined but never called. This is why no output is being produced. In a script intended to run directly, the function should be called after its definition.

3. **Output:**
   - The code correctly formats the output to two decimal places and stores it in a list, which is then printed line by line. This part seems correct.

4. **Solution Steps:**
   - The logic for calculating the x-coordinate of the mirror is correct based on the formula derived from the line equation.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the function is called so that the input is processed and output is generated. Let's update the code to include a function call:

```python
def calculate_mirror_position():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read Kabir's coordinates
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        # Read Tara's coordinates
        x2 = int(data[index + 2])
        y2 = int(data[index + 3])
        
        # Move to the next set of coordinates
        index += 4
        
        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror
        x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
        
        # Store the result formatted to two decimal places
        results.append(f"{x_mirror:.2f}")
    
    # Print all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the solution
calculate_mirror_position()
```

This updated code includes a call to `calculate_mirror_position()` at the end, ensuring that the function is executed and the input is processed correctly.

Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break to reach the origin from a given starting point, or if the starting point lies on a wall. The walls are represented as line segments in the first quadrant, and the solution required efficient handling of multiple test cases with potentially large input sizes.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Set for Fast Lookup**: Using a set to store wall positions allowed for O(1) time complexity when checking if a starting point lies on a wall.
    - **Counting with Conditions**: The problem required counting how many wall positions are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point. This was efficiently handled by iterating over the sorted list of wall positions.

    ### Strategies
    - **Input Parsing and Management**: Efficiently parsing input and managing indices was crucial given the constraints.
    - **Iterative Counting**: Instead of using complex data structures, a simple iteration over the sorted list of wall positions was sufficient to count the walls Chef needs to break.

    ### Code Snippet
    ```python
    a_set = set(a)  # Convert list to set for O(1) lookup
    for _ in range(Q):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
    
        sum_xy = x + y
        if sum_xy in a_set:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            count = 0
            for ai in a:
                if ai > sum_xy:
                    count += 1
            results.append(count)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of using appropriate data structures for fast lookups and the simplicity of iterative solutions when dealing with sorted data. The solution was efficient and passed all test cases without any issues.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile through the mirror. Given the coordinates of Kabir and Tara, we need to calculate this x-coordinate for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The mirror should be placed such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This means the mirror should be placed at the midpoint of the x-coordinates of Kabir and Tara when projected onto the x-axis. The formula for the x-coordinate of the mirror is derived from the line equation that passes through both points and reflects off the x-axis.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   For each test case:
       Read the coordinates (x1, y1) for Kabir
       Read the coordinates (x2, y2) for Tara
       Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the formula:
           x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
       Print the x-coordinate of the mirror with a precision of two decimal places
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and splits it into a list of strings. This is generally correct for competitive programming, but it seems the function `calculate_mirror_position()` is not being called, which means the code isn't executing.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The function `calculate_mirror_position()` is defined but never called. This is why no output is being produced. In a script intended to run directly, the function should be called after its definition.

3. **Output:**
   - The code correctly formats the output to two decimal places and stores it in a list, which is then printed line by line. This part seems correct.

4. **Solution Steps:**
   - The logic for calculating the x-coordinate of the mirror is correct based on the formula derived from the line equation.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the function is called so that the input is processed and output is generated. Let's update the code to include a function call:

```python
def calculate_mirror_position():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])

    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read Kabir's coordinates
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        # Read Tara's coordinates
        x2 = int(data[index + 2])
        y2 = int(data[index + 3])
        
        # Move to the next set of coordinates
        index += 4
        
        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror
        x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
        
        # Store the result formatted to two decimal places
        results.append(f"{x_mirror:.2f}")
    
    # Print all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the solution

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile. The solution involved calculating the x-coordinate using the formula derived from the line equation that passes through both points and reflects off the x-axis. The key formula used was:

\[ x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x1 \times y2 + x2 \times y1}{y1 + y2} \]

### Key Concepts:
- **Geometry and Reflection**: The problem required understanding the concept of reflection and how to calculate the midpoint of a line segment projected onto an axis.
- **Precision Handling**: The output needed to be formatted to two decimal places, which was achieved using Python's string formatting.

### Strategies and Fixes:
- **Input Handling**: Initially, the function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function was called fixed this issue.
- **Output Formatting**: Using formatted strings to ensure the output met the precision requirements was crucial.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile through the mirror. Given the coordinates of Kabir and Tara, we need to calculate this x-coordinate for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The mirror should be placed such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This means the mirror should be placed at the midpoint of the x-coordinates of Kabir and Tara when projected onto the x-axis. The formula for the x-coordinate of the mirror is derived from the line equation that passes through both points and reflects off the x-axis.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   For each test case:
       Read the coordinates (x1, y1) for Kabir
       Read the coordinates (x2, y2) for Tara
       Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the formula:
           x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
       Print the x-coordinate of the mirror with a precision of two decimal places
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def calculate_mirror_position():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read Kabir's coordinates
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        # Read Tara's coordinates
        x2 = int(data[index + 2])
        y2 = int(data[index + 3])
        
        # Move to the next set of coordinates
        index += 4
        
        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror
        x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)

        results.append(f"{x_mirror:.2f}")
    
    # Print all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads input for multiple test cases, calculates the x-coordinate of the mirror for each case using the formula derived from the line equation, and outputs the result with a precision of two decimal places.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and splits it into a list of strings. This is generally correct for competitive programming, but it seems the function `calculate_mirror_position()` is not being called, which means the code isn't executing.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The function `calculate_mirror_position()` is defined but never called. This is why no output is being produced. In a script intended to run directly, the function should be called after its definition.

3. **Output:**
   - The code correctly formats the output to two decimal places and stores it in a list, which is then printed line by line. This part seems correct.

4. **Solution Steps:**
   - The logic for calculating the x-coordinate of the mirror is correct based on the formula derived from the line equation.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the function is called so that the input is processed and output is generated. Let's update the code to include a function call:

```python
def calculate_mirror_position():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read number of test cases
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read Kabir's coordinates
        x1 = int(data[index])
        y1 = int(data[index + 1])
        # Read Tara's coordinates
        x2 = int(data[index + 2])
        y2 = int(data[index + 3])
        
        # Move to the next set of coordinates
        index += 4
        
        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror
        x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
        
        # Store the result formatted to two decimal places
        results.append(f"{x_mirror:.2f}")
    
    # Print all results, each on a new line
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the solution
calculate_mirror_position()
```

This updated code includes a call to `calculate_mirror_position()` at the end, ensuring that the function is executed and the input is processed correctly.

### Explanation:
- **Function Call**: The function `calculate_mirror_position()` is now called at the end of the script, ensuring that the input is processed and the output is generated.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings. The function processes each test case by reading the coordinates and calculating the x-coordinate of the mirror.
- **Output**: The results are formatted to two decimal places and printed line by line. This ensures the output matches the required precision.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task was to find the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile. This involves understanding the geometry of reflection and using the line equation.

2. **Approach:**
   - My approach involved calculating the x-coordinate of the mirror using a derived formula based on the line equation. This was straightforward and worked correctly once the function was called properly.
   - The official solution uses a similar approach but explicitly calculates the slope (`m`) and y-intercept (`c`) of the line connecting Kabir and Tara, then finds the x-coordinate where this line intersects the x-axis.

3. **Key Differences:**
   - The official solution uses a more explicit geometric approach by manipulating the line equation directly, which is insightful for understanding the underlying geometry.
   - My solution directly applied a formula derived from the line equation, which is efficient but less explicit in terms of geometric reasoning.

4. **Lessons Learned:**
   - Ensure that functions are called when writing scripts intended for execution, as missing a function call can lead to no output.
   - Understanding the geometric principles behind the problem can provide alternative ways to derive the solution, as seen in the official solution.

Overall, both solutions are valid, but the official solution provides a more detailed breakdown of the geometric reasoning, which can be beneficial for understanding similar problems in the future.
