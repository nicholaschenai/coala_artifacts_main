## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Help Saurabh with his Chemistry Assignment.

Saurabh has been given a chemistry assignment by Ruby Mam. Though the assignment is simple but

Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.

So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesnâ€™t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment

is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in

box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the

number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.

-----Input-----
The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space

separated integers N and X .

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo

10^6+3

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100000
- 1 â‰¤ N,X â‰¤ 10^18

-----Example-----
Input:
2
1 2
2 1

Output:
2
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 2.At t=0 particles are 1 ,so at t=1 ,particles are 1*1 = 1 particles. At t=2, particles are 2*1 = 2 particles.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. We have multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` modulo `10^6 + 3`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Growth**: 
   - At `t=0`, the number of particles is `X`.
   - At `t=1`, the number of particles is `1 * X`.
   - At `t=2`, the number of particles is `2 * (1 * X)`.
   - At `t=3`, the number of particles is `3 * (2 * (1 * X))`, and so on.
   - This pattern shows that the number of particles at time `N` is `N! * X`.

2. **Handling Large Numbers**:
   - Direct computation of factorials for large `N` is not feasible due to size.
   - We need to compute `N! * X % (10^6 + 3)`.
   - Use modular arithmetic properties to compute the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3`.

3. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Use a loop to compute the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` iteratively.
   - Multiply the result by `X` and take modulo `10^6 + 3`.

## Pseudocode

```
MOD = 10^6 + 3

function compute_particles(N, X):
    if N == 0:
        return X % MOD
    factorial_mod = 1
    for i from 1 to N:
        factorial_mod = (factorial_mod * i) % MOD
    result = (factorial_mod * X) % MOD
    return result

read T
for each test case:
    read N, X
    print compute_particles(N, X)
```

## Python Solution

```python
def compute_particles(N, X):
    MOD = 10**6 + 3
    if N == 0:
        # If N is 0, the number of particles is simply X
        return X % MOD
    
    factorial_mod = 1
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        factorial_mod = (factorial_mod * i) % MOD
    
    result = (factorial_mod * X) % MOD
    return result

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        X = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(compute_particles(N, X))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# The main function will be called when the script is executed
# It reads from standard input and writes to standard output
```

This solution efficiently computes the number of particles at time `N` for each test case, using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to determine how many times students from the first, second, and third years all arrive on campus at the same time over a period of `n` days. Each year group has a different frequency of visiting the campus: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on the same day.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the number of times within `n` days that the first, second, and third-year students are all on campus simultaneously. This happens when the time is a common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

        2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The key to solving this problem is to find the least common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The LCM of these three numbers will give us the interval at which all three groups are on campus together.

        3. **Counting Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this interval fits into the total number of hours in `n` days (i.e., `n * 24` hours).

        4. **Iterate for Each Test Case**: For each test case, calculate the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z`, and then determine how many times this LCM fits into the total hours.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function gcd(a, b):
            while b is not 0:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a

        function lcm(a, b):
            return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

        function lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

        function process_test_cases():
            read T  # number of test cases
            for each test case:
                read N  # number of days
                read x, y, z  # frequencies of visits for each year group

                total_hours = N * 24
                lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
                result = total_hours // lcm_value

                print result
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def gcd(a, b):
            # Calculate the greatest common divisor using Euclid's algorithm
            while b != 0:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a

        def lcm(a, b):
            # Calculate the least common multiple using the gcd
            return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

        def lcm_of_three(a, b, c):
            # Calculate the lcm of three numbers
            return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

        def process_test_cases():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
    
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                index += 1
                x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])
                index += 3
        
                total_hours = N * 24
                lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
                result = total_hours // lcm_value
        
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        process_test_cases()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **GCD and LCM Functions**: We use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is then used to compute the least common multiple (LCM).
        - **LCM of Three Numbers**: We compute the LCM of three numbers by first finding the LCM of two numbers and then using that result to find the LCM with the third number.
        - **Total Hours Calculation**: We convert the number of days into hours since the students visit every few hours.
        - **Result Calculation**: For each test case, we calculate how many times the LCM fits into the total hours to determine the number of times all three groups are on campus simultaneously.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
        - Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
        - $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
        - $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$
        - $1 \leq k \leq 100$

        -----Subtasks-----
        Subtask1 
        - 
        $1 \leq T \leq 10$
        - 
        $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^4$
        Subtask2
        - 
        Original Constraints 

        -----Sample Input:-----
        1
        5 3
        1 3 5
        2 5 2
        3 4 7

        -----Sample Output:-----
        202

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        Initial score of students will be : $[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$
        after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 50, 50, 10, 10]$
        after solving question 2 scores will be: $[50, 100, 100, 20, 20]$
        after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 100, 700, 140, 20]$
        Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will $(50+100+700+140+20)/5 = 202$

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the `main()` function, which contains the logic for reading input and producing output, is not being executed. In Python scripts, especially when using functions, it's crucial to ensure that the main logic is called when the script is executed.

        ### Steps to Identify the Problem

        1. **Check Function Execution**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script. Without this call, the script will define the functions but never execute them.
        2. **Input/Output Handling**: Verify that the input is being read correctly and that the output is being printed as expected.
        3. **Index Management**: Ensure that the index used to parse the input data is managed correctly to avoid any off-by-one errors or incorrect data parsing.

        ### Correction Steps

        1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Add a call to the `main()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        2. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the input parsing logic to ensure that it correctly handles the input format and constraints.

        ### Revised Solution

        ```python
        def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
            # Initialize scores for each student
            scores = [10] * N
    
            # Process each question
            for i, j, k in questions:
                for student in range(i, j + 1):
                    scores[student] *= k
    
            # Calculate the mean of the scores
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
            return mean_score

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                M = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                questions = []
                for _ in range(M):
                    i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
                    j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
                    k = int(data[index + 2])
                    index += 3
                    questions.append((i, j, k))
        
                result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Ensure the main function is called
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Function Call**: The `main()` function is now called when the script is executed, ensuring that the input is read and processed, and the output is printed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, split into a list of strings, and parsed using an index to handle multiple test cases efficiently.
        - **Output**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed at the end. This ensures that all outputs are correctly displayed.

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. At each time `t`, the number of particles is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. We have multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` modulo `10^6 + 3`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - For each test case, we start with `X` particles at time `t=0`.
   - At each subsequent time `t`, the number of particles is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`.
   - This can be represented as a product: `X * 1 * 2 * ... * N`.
   - The result can be very large, so we need to compute it modulo `10^6 + 3`.
   - Use modular arithmetic properties to compute the result efficiently, especially since `N` can be very large.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function calculate_particles(N, X):
       MOD = 10^6 + 3
       if N == 0:
           return X % MOD
       result = X
       for t from 1 to N:
           result = (result * t) % MOD
       return result

    # Initialize the result with the initial number of particles

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Help Saurabh with his Chemistry Assignment.

Saurabh has been given a chemistry assignment by Ruby Mam. Though the assignment is simple but

Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.

So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesnâ€™t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment

is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in

box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the

number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.

-----Input-----
The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space

separated integers N and X .

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo

10^6+3

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100000
- 1 â‰¤ N,X â‰¤ 10^18

-----Example-----
Input:
2
1 2
2 1

Output:
2
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 2.At t=0 particles are 1 ,so at t=1 ,particles are 1*1 = 1 particles. At t=2, particles are 2*1 = 2 particles.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to compute the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at each time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. This results in a factorial-like growth, which can become very large, so the challenge was to compute this efficiently using modular arithmetic.

The key strategy was to use a loop to compute the product of numbers from `1` to `N`, multiplied by `X`, and take the result modulo `10^6 + 3` at each step to prevent overflow and keep the computation efficient. This approach leverages the properties of modular arithmetic, which allows us to take the modulo at each multiplication step without affecting the final result.

The solution was implemented in Python, using a function to handle the computation for each test case and reading input directly from standard input for efficiency, given the potentially large number of test cases. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness and efficiency of the approach. This problem reinforced the importance of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers and factorial-like computations.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Help Saurabh with his Chemistry Assignment.

Saurabh has been given a chemistry assignment by Ruby Mam. Though the assignment is simple but

Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.

So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesnâ€™t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment

is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in

box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the

number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.

-----Input-----
The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space

separated integers N and X .

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo

10^6+3

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100000
- 1 â‰¤ N,X â‰¤ 10^18

-----Example-----
Input:
2
1 2
2 1

Output:
2
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 2.At t=0 particles are 1 ,so at t=1 ,particles are 1*1 = 1 particles. At t=2, particles are 2*1 = 2 particles.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. At each time `t`, the number of particles is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. We have multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` modulo `10^6 + 3`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - For each test case, we start with `X` particles at time `t=0`.
   - At each subsequent time `t`, the number of particles is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`.
   - This can be represented as a product: `X * 1 * 2 * ... * N`.
   - The result can be very large, so we need to compute it modulo `10^6 + 3`.
   - Use modular arithmetic properties to compute the result efficiently, especially since `N` can be very large.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function calculate_particles(N, X):
       MOD = 10^6 + 3
       if N == 0:
           return X % MOD
       result = X
       for t from 1 to N:
           result = (result * t) % MOD
       return result

   function main():
       read T  # number of test cases
       for each test case:
           read N, X
           print calculate_particles(N, X)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def calculate_particles(N, X):
    # Define the modulo constant
    MOD = 10**6 + 3
    
    # If N is 0, the number of particles is simply X
    if N == 0:
        return X % MOD
    
    # Initialize the result with the initial number of particles
    result = X
    
    # Calculate the number of particles at time N using modular arithmetic
    for t in range(1, N + 1):
        result = (result * t) % MOD
    
    return result

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    # Read the number of test cases
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    # Process each test case

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

 a.append((a[-1]*ii)%M)
for __ in range(eval(input())):
 n, x = list(map(int, input().split()))
 if n>=M: print(0)
 else: print((a[n]*x)%M)


INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] The official solution provides an efficient way to handle the problem by precomputing factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` up to a certain limit. This approach is insightful because it leverages the fact that factorials grow very quickly, and for any `n` greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` will be zero due to the properties of modular arithmetic.

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials:** The solution precomputes the factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` for all numbers up to `10^6 + 3`. This allows for constant-time retrieval of factorial values during each test case, significantly speeding up the computation.

2. **Handling Large `n`:** If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the result is immediately zero because the factorial will include a full cycle of the modulus, making the result zero.

3. **Efficiency:** By precomputing the factorials, the solution avoids recalculating them for each test case, which is crucial given the constraints where `N` can be as large as `10^18`. This reduces the time complexity for each test case to O(1) after the initial precomputation.

In contrast, my initial approach recalculated the factorial for each test case, which would be inefficient for large values of `N`. The official solution's use of precomputation and the properties of modular arithmetic provides a more optimal and scalable solution. This experience highlights the importance of recognizing opportunities for precomputation and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify and optimize solutions.
