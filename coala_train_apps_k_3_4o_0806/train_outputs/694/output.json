    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine how many times students from the first, second, and third years all arrive on campus at the same time over a period of `n` days. Each year group has a different frequency of visiting the campus: first-year students every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of times all three groups are present on the same day.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the number of times within `n` days that the first, second, and third-year students are all on campus simultaneously. This happens when the time is a common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\n2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The key to solving this problem is to find the least common multiple of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The LCM of these three numbers will give us the interval at which all three groups are on campus together.\n\n3. **Counting Occurrences**: Once we have the LCM, we can determine how many times this interval fits into the total number of hours in `n` days (i.e., `n * 24` hours).\n\n4. **Iterate for Each Test Case**: For each test case, calculate the LCM of `x`, `y`, and `z`, and then determine how many times this LCM fits into the total hours.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction gcd(a, b):\n    while b is not 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\nfunction lcm(a, b):\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\nfunction lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\nfunction process_test_cases():\n    read T  # number of test cases\n    for each test case:\n        read N  # number of days\n        read x, y, z  # frequencies of visits for each year group\n\n        total_hours = N * 24\n        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        result = total_hours // lcm_value\n\n        print result\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    # Calculate the greatest common divisor using Euclid's algorithm\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    # Calculate the least common multiple using the gcd\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\ndef lcm_of_three(a, b, c):\n    # Calculate the lcm of three numbers\n    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)\n\ndef process_test_cases():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        x, y, z = map(int, data[index:index+3])\n        index += 3\n        \n        total_hours = N * 24\n        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        result = total_hours // lcm_value\n        \n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nprocess_test_cases()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **GCD and LCM Functions**: We use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is then used to compute the least common multiple (LCM).\n- **LCM of Three Numbers**: We compute the LCM of three numbers by first finding the LCM of two numbers and then using that result to find the LCM with the third number.\n- **Total Hours Calculation**: We convert the number of days into hours since the students visit every few hours.\n- **Result Calculation**: For each test case, we calculate how many times the LCM fits into the total hours to determine the number of times all three groups are on campus simultaneously.",
