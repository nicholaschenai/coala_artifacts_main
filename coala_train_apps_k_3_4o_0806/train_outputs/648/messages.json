In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.\nJudges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.\nPlease help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:\nType 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).\nType 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).\n\n-----Input-----\n- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.\n- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.\n- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 100,000\n- 1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 1,000,000\n- 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N\n- -1,000,000 \u2264 X \u2264 1,000,000\n- 1 \u2264 i, k \u2264 N\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 1,000 \n- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n5 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 1 2\n2 3 4 -1\n1 1 2\n\nOutput:\n3\n4\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.\nThe second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).\nThe last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

We need to handle two types of operations on these hills:\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**:\n   - Start at the given hill index `i`.\n   - For each jump, look for the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.\n   - If such a hill is found within 100 hills, move to that hill and continue jumping.\n   - If no such hill is found, or if the maximum number of jumps `k` is reached, stop and return the current hill index.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**:\n   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for each operation in operations:\n        if operation is of Type 1:\n            i, k = operation parameters\n            current_index = i - 1\n            for jump in range(k):\n                found_higher_hill = False\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        current_index = j\n                        found_higher_hill = True\n                        break\n                if not found_higher_hill:\n                    break\n            output current_index + 1\n        else if operation is of Type 2:\n            L, R, X = operation parameters\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    results = []\n    for operation in operations:\n        if operation[0] == 1:\n            # Type 1 operation\n            i, k = operation[1], operation[2]\n            current_index = i - 1\n            for _ in range(k):\n                found_higher_hill = False\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        current_index = j\n                        found_higher_hill = True\n                        break\n                if not found_higher_hill:\n                    break\n            results.append(current_index + 1)\n        elif operation[0] == 2:\n            # Type 2 operation\n            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nN = int(data[0])\nQ = int(data[1])\nheights = list(map(int, data[2:N+2]))\noperations = []\nindex = N + 2\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    op_type = int(data[index])\n    if op_type == 1:\n        i = int(data[index + 1])\n        k = int(data[index + 2])\n        operations.append((1, i, k))\n        index += 3\n    elif op_type == 2:\n        L = int(data[index + 1])\n        R = int(data[index + 2])\n        X = int(data[index + 3])\n        operations.append((2, L, R, X))\n        index += 4\n\n# Process operations and print results\nresults = process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the results for Type 1 operations.

Ada wants to place water reservoirs on some hills such that water can flow optimally to cover all hills. Water from a reservoir flows in one direction until it reaches a hill that is taller than the hill with the reservoir. The task is to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to ensure all hills receive water.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Water Flow**: Water from a reservoir on a hill can flow left or right until it encounters a hill taller than the reservoir's hill. This means that a reservoir can cover all hills up to the first taller hill in the chosen direction.\n\n        2. **Optimal Reservoir Placement**:\n           - We need to ensure that every hill is covered by at least one reservoir.\n           - To minimize the number of reservoirs, we should place them at strategic points where they can cover the maximum number of hills.\n\n        3. **Strategy**:\n           - Traverse the list of hills from left to right to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to cover all hills.\n           - Use a greedy approach: place a reservoir at a hill and let it cover as many hills as possible until a taller hill is encountered.\n           - Repeat the process until all hills are covered.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function min_reservoirs(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                N, heights = test_case\n                reservoirs = 0\n                i = 0\n                while i < N:\n                    reservoirs += 1\n                    current_height = heights[i]\n                    # Move to the right until a taller hill is found\n                    while i < N and heights[i] <= current_height:\n                        i += 1\n                print(reservoirs)\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def min_reservoirs(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N, heights = test_case\n                reservoirs = 0\n                i = 0\n                while i < N:\n                    reservoirs += 1\n                    current_height = heights[i]\n                    # Move to the right until a taller hill is found\n                    while i < N and heights[i] <= current_height:\n                        i += 1\n                results.append(reservoirs)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                heights = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, heights))\n    \n            min_reservoirs(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Input Handling**: The input is read in a single block and split into manageable parts.

On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it \u2014 either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height $h$, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than $h$; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.\n        For example, suppose we have hills with heights $[7, 2, 3, 5, 8]$. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height $5$, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights $2$, $3$ and $5$ are supplied with water.\n        Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

If no such hill exists within 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation**:\n   - Start at hill `i`.\n   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.\n   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.\n   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation**:\n   - Simply iterate over the hills from `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for each operation in operations:\n        if operation is of type 1:\n            i, k = operation parameters\n            current_index = i - 1\n            for jump in range(k):\n                next_index = -1\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        next_index = j\n                        break\n                if next_index == -1:\n                    break\n                current_index = next_index\n            print(current_index + 1)\n        else if operation is of type 2:\n            L, R, X = operation parameters\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n```\n\n## Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for operation in operations:\n        if operation[0] == 1:\n            # Type 1 operation\n            i, k = operation[1], operation[2]\n            current_index = i - 1\n            for _ in range(k):\n                next_index = -1\n                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):\n                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:\n                        next_index = j\n                        break\n                if next_index == -1:\n                    break\n                current_index = next_index\n            print(current_index + 1)\n        elif operation[0] == 2:\n            # Type 2 operation\n            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    N = int(data[index])\n    Q = int(data[index + 1])\n    index += 2\n    \n    heights = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n    index += N\n    \n    operations = []\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        op_type = int(data[index])\n        if op_type == 1:\n            i = int(data[index + 1])\n            k = int(data[index + 2])\n            operations.append((op_type, i, k))\n            index += 3\n        elif op_type == 2:\n            L = int(data[index + 1])\n            R = int(data[index + 2])\n            X = int(data[index + 3])\n            operations.append((op_type, L, R, X))\n            index += 4\n    \n    process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Type 1 Operation**: We simulate the jumps by iterating over the hills to the right of the current hill, looking for the first hill that is strictly higher. We repeat this process for `k` jumps or until no further jumps can be made.\n- **Type 2 Operation**: We simply iterate over the specified range and adjust the heights by `X`."

The core concepts involved were array manipulation and simulation of a jumping process based on specific conditions.\n\nFor the **Type 1 Operation**, the challenge was to simulate a participant jumping from one hill to the next strictly higher hill, up to `k` times, or until no further jumps could be made within a 100-hill limit. The key strategy was to iterate over the hills to the right of the current position and find the first hill that is strictly higher, updating the current position accordingly.\n\nFor the **Type 2 Operation**, the task was straightforward: adjust the heights of hills within a specified range by a given amount. This involved simple iteration and arithmetic operations on the array of hill heights.\n\nThe solution was implemented efficiently to handle the constraints, particularly the large possible values for `N` and `Q` (up to 100,000). The use of direct iteration and condition checks ensured that the operations were performed in a time-efficient manner.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding array manipulation and simulation techniques, especially in competitive programming contexts where constraints are tight. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness and efficiency of the approach."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the hill jumping competition, the task was to handle two types of operations efficiently on a sequence of hills. The operations involved simulating jumps based on hill heights and adjusting hill heights over specified ranges.\n\n### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Type 1 Operation (Jump Simulation):**\n   - The official solution uses a nested loop to simulate the jumps. It iterates up to 100 hills to the right of the current position to find the next hill that is strictly higher. This is efficient given the constraints, as it limits the search to a maximum of 100 hills, ensuring the operation remains manageable even for large inputs.\n\n2. **Type 2 Operation (Height Adjustment):**\n   - The solution directly iterates over the specified range and adjusts the heights. This straightforward approach is optimal given the constraints, as it directly modifies the heights in a single pass.\n\n### Comparison with My Approach:\n\n- My approach was similar in logic to the official solution, particularly in handling the jump simulation by iterating over a limited range to find the next higher hill.\n- The official solution uses a `while` loop with a condition to break early if a suitable hill is found, which is a slight optimization over my use of a `for` loop with a break statement.\n- Both solutions effectively handle the height adjustment operation by iterating over the specified range and applying the change.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe problem was a good exercise in efficiently handling operations on sequences with constraints. The official solution confirmed the effectiveness of the approach I took, with minor differences in loop constructs. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and optimizing search ranges to ensure performance remains within acceptable limits."

It then parses this input data into appropriate variables and structures. The function processes each operation, where type 1 operations involve finding a position in the heights list by moving to the next greater height up to a specified number of times, and type 2 operations involve incrementing a range of heights by a specified value. After parsing and processing the operations, it calls another function to execute these operations on the heights list.\n\n[end of description]\nThis problem is useful in scenarios where you need to simulate a sequence of operations on a data structure, particularly when dealing with range updates and queries. The problem involves two types of operations: jumping to the next higher element within a constraint and updating a range of elements. This is a common pattern in competitive programming and can be applied to problems involving range queries and updates, such as those that can be solved using segment trees or binary indexed trees. Understanding how to efficiently handle these operations is crucial in optimizing performance for large datasets, especially when the number of operations is large."
