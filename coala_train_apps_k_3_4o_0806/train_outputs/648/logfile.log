## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills, each with a specific height. We need to handle two types of operations on these hills:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the final hill index after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within a distance of 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start at the given hill index `i`.
   - For each jump, look for the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.
   - If such a hill is found within 100 hills, move to that hill and continue jumping.
   - If no such hill is found, or if the maximum number of jumps `k` is reached, stop and return the current hill index.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the hills from index `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of Type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i - 1
            for jump in range(k):
                found_higher_hill = False
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        current_index = j
                        found_higher_hill = True
                        break
                if not found_higher_hill:
                    break
            output current_index + 1
        else if operation is of Type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    results = []
    for operation in operations:
        if operation[0] == 1:
            # Type 1 operation
            i, k = operation[1], operation[2]
            current_index = i - 1
            for _ in range(k):
                found_higher_hill = False
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        current_index = j
                        found_higher_hill = True
                        break
                if not found_higher_hill:
                    break
            results.append(current_index + 1)
        elif operation[0] == 2:
            # Type 2 operation
            L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
N = int(data[0])
Q = int(data[1])
heights = list(map(int, data[2:N+2]))
operations = []
index = N + 2
for _ in range(Q):
    op_type = int(data[index])
    if op_type == 1:
        i = int(data[index + 1])
        k = int(data[index + 2])
        operations.append((1, i, k))
        index += 3
    elif op_type == 2:
        L = int(data[index + 1])
        R = int(data[index + 2])
        X = int(data[index + 3])
        operations.append((2, L, R, X))
        index += 4

# Process operations and print results
results = process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input, processes each operation according to its type, and outputs the results for Type 1 operations. The logic ensures that the constraints and requirements of the problem are met efficiently.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

    [Task]:
        In ChefLand, there is a mountain range consisting of $N$ hills (numbered $1$ through $N$) in a straight line. Let's denote the height of the $i$-th hill from the left by $h_i$.
        Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it â€” either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height $h$, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than $h$; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.
        For example, suppose we have hills with heights $[7, 2, 3, 5, 8]$. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height $5$, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights $2$, $3$ and $5$ are supplied with water.
        Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of reservoirs.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $2 \le N \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
        - $h_i \neq h_j $ for any valid $i \neq j$
        - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

        ### Problem Restatement

        In ChefLand, there is a mountain range with hills of varying heights. Ada wants to place water reservoirs on some hills such that water can flow optimally to cover all hills. Water from a reservoir flows in one direction until it reaches a hill that is taller than the hill with the reservoir. The task is to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to ensure all hills receive water.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Water Flow**: Water from a reservoir on a hill can flow left or right until it encounters a hill taller than the reservoir's hill. This means that a reservoir can cover all hills up to the first taller hill in the chosen direction.

        2. **Optimal Reservoir Placement**:
           - We need to ensure that every hill is covered by at least one reservoir.
           - To minimize the number of reservoirs, we should place them at strategic points where they can cover the maximum number of hills.

        3. **Strategy**:
           - Traverse the list of hills from left to right to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to cover all hills.
           - Use a greedy approach: place a reservoir at a hill and let it cover as many hills as possible until a taller hill is encountered.
           - Repeat the process until all hills are covered.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function min_reservoirs(T, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, heights = test_case
                reservoirs = 0
                i = 0
                while i < N:
                    reservoirs += 1
                    current_height = heights[i]
                    # Move to the right until a taller hill is found
                    while i < N and heights[i] <= current_height:
                        i += 1
                print(reservoirs)
        ```

        ### Final Python Code

        ```python
        def min_reservoirs(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                N, heights = test_case
                reservoirs = 0
                i = 0
                while i < N:
                    reservoirs += 1
                    current_height = heights[i]
                    # Move to the right until a taller hill is found
                    while i < N and heights[i] <= current_height:
                        i += 1
                results.append(reservoirs)

        ### Explanation

        - **Input Handling**: The input is read in a single block and split into manageable parts. Each test case is processed separately.
        - **Reservoir Placement**: For each test case, we iterate through the list of hill heights. We place a reservoir at the current hill and move right until a taller hill is encountered, incrementing the reservoir count each time we place a new reservoir.
        - **Output**: The results for each test case are collected and printed at the end.

    [Task]:
        In ChefLand, there is a mountain range consisting of $N$ hills (numbered $1$ through $N$) in a straight line. Let's denote the height of the $i$-th hill from the left by $h_i$.
        Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it â€” either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height $h$, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than $h$; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.
        For example, suppose we have hills with heights $[7, 2, 3, 5, 8]$. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height $5$, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights $2$, $3$ and $5$ are supplied with water.
        Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of reservoirs.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $2 \le N \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
        - $h_i \neq h_j $ for any valid $i \neq j$
        - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

        -----Example Input-----
        1
        6
        4 16 32 6 8 2

        -----Example Output-----
        2    

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1: We can place reservoirs on the second and third hill, pumping water to the left and right respectively.

        ### Analysis of the Problem

        The problem requires us to place the minimum number of reservoirs such that all hills are covered by water. The water flows from a reservoir until it encounters a hill that is taller than the hill with the reservoir. The goal is to cover all hills with the fewest reservoirs possible.

        ### Where the Code Went Wrong

        1. **Incorrect Reservoir Placement Logic**: The current logic places a reservoir at every hill and moves to the right until a taller hill is found. This approach does not consider the possibility of covering more hills by placing reservoirs strategically.

        2. **Greedy Strategy Misapplication**: The greedy approach should ensure that each reservoir covers as many hills as possible, but the current implementation does not effectively utilize this strategy.

        3. **Directionality**: The code only considers moving to the right, but it should also consider the possibility of moving to the left to cover hills optimally.

        ### Correct Approach

        1. **Two-Pass Strategy**:
           - **Left to Right Pass**: Determine the farthest hill that can be covered by a reservoir placed at each hill when moving to the right.
           - **Right to Left Pass**: Determine the farthest hill that can be covered by a reservoir placed at each hill when moving to the left.
   
        2. **Combine Results**: Use the results from both passes to determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to cover all hills.

        ### Revised Pseudocode

        ```
        function min_reservoirs(T, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, heights = test_case
                right_cover = [0] * N
                left_cover = [0] * N
        
                # Calculate right cover
                for i from 0 to N-1:
                    right_cover[i] = i
                    while right_cover[i] + 1 < N and heights[right_cover[i] + 1] <= heights[i]:
                        right_cover[i] += 1
        
                # Calculate left cover
                for i from N-1 to 0:
                    left_cover[i] = i
                    while left_cover[i] - 1 >= 0 and heights[left_cover[i] - 1] <= heights[i]:
                        left_cover[i] -= 1
        
                # Determine minimum reservoirs
                reservoirs = 0
                i = 0
                while i < N:
                    reservoirs += 1
                    # Choose the farthest point we can cover
                    i = max(right_cover[i], left_cover[i]) + 1
        
                print(reservoirs)
        ```

                reservoirs = 0
                i = 0
                while i < N:

                    while i < N and heights[i] <= current_height:
                        i += 1

We have a sequence of hills with given heights. We need to perform two types of operations:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the index of the hill where a participant will end up after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start at hill `i`.
   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.
   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.
   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the hills from `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i - 1
            for jump in range(k):
                next_index = -1
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        next_index = j
                        break
                if next_index == -1:
                    break
                current_index = next_index
            print(current_index + 1)
        else if operation is of type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X
```

## Final Python Code

```python
def process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for operation in operations:
        if operation[0] == 1:
            # Type 1 operation

            index += 4
    
    process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Type 1 Operation**: We simulate the jumps by iterating over the hills to the right of the current hill, looking for the first hill that is strictly higher. We repeat this process for `k` jumps or until no further jumps can be made.
- **Type 2 Operation**: We simply iterate over the specified range and adjust the heights by `X`.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.
   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.
   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.

### Explanation

- **Type 1 Operation**: We simulate the jumps by iterating over the hills to the right of the current hill, looking for the first hill that is strictly higher. We repeat this process for `k` jumps or until no further jumps can be made.
- **Type 2 Operation**: We simply iterate over the specified range and adjust the heights by `X`.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] In this problem, I tackled a simulation task involving two types of operations on a sequence of hills with given heights. The core concepts involved were array manipulation and simulation of a jumping process based on specific conditions.

For the **Type 1 Operation**, the challenge was to simulate a participant jumping from one hill to the next strictly higher hill, up to `k` times, or until no further jumps could be made within a 100-hill limit. The key strategy was to iterate over the hills to the right of the current position and find the first hill that is strictly higher, updating the current position accordingly.

For the **Type 2 Operation**, the task was straightforward: adjust the heights of hills within a specified range by a given amount. This involved simple iteration and arithmetic operations on the array of hill heights.

The solution was implemented efficiently to handle the constraints, particularly the large possible values for `N` and `Q` (up to 100,000). The use of direct iteration and condition checks ensured that the operations were performed in a time-efficient manner.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of understanding array manipulation and simulation techniques, especially in competitive programming contexts where constraints are tight. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness and efficiency of the approach.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [prompt] ## Problem Restatement

We have a sequence of hills with given heights. We need to perform two types of operations:

1. **Type 1 Operation**: Given a starting hill index `i` and a number of jumps `k`, determine the index of the hill where a participant will end up after making `k` jumps. A jump is made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill. If no such hill exists within 100 hills, the participant stays on the current hill.

2. **Type 2 Operation**: Given a range of hills from `L` to `R` and a height change `X`, adjust the heights of all hills in this range by `X`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Type 1 Operation**:
   - Start at hill `i`.
   - For each jump, find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill.
   - If no such hill exists within 100 hills, stop jumping.
   - Repeat this process `k` times or until no further jumps can be made.

2. **Type 2 Operation**:
   - Simply iterate over the hills from `L` to `R` and adjust their heights by `X`.

## Pseudocode

```
function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):
    for each operation in operations:
        if operation is of type 1:
            i, k = operation parameters
            current_index = i - 1
            for jump in range(k):
                next_index = -1
                for j in range(current_index + 1, min(current_index + 101, N)):
                    if heights[j] > heights[current_index]:
                        next_index = j
                        break
                if next_index == -1:
                    break
                current_index = next_index
            print(current_index + 1)
        else if operation is of type 2:
            L, R, X = operation parameters
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for the hill jumping competition, the task was to handle two types of operations efficiently on a sequence of hills. The operations involved simulating jumps based on hill heights and adjusting hill heights over specified ranges.

### Key Insights:

1. **Type 1 Operation (Jump Simulation):**
   - The official solution uses a nested loop to simulate the jumps. It iterates up to 100 hills to the right of the current position to find the next hill that is strictly higher. This is efficient given the constraints, as it limits the search to a maximum of 100 hills, ensuring the operation remains manageable even for large inputs.

2. **Type 2 Operation (Height Adjustment):**
   - The solution directly iterates over the specified range and adjusts the heights. This straightforward approach is optimal given the constraints, as it directly modifies the heights in a single pass.

### Comparison with My Approach:

- My approach was similar in logic to the official solution, particularly in handling the jump simulation by iterating over a limited range to find the next higher hill.
- The official solution uses a `while` loop with a condition to break early if a suitable hill is found, which is a slight optimization over my use of a `for` loop with a break statement.
- Both solutions effectively handle the height adjustment operation by iterating over the specified range and applying the change.

### Conclusion:

The problem was a good exercise in efficiently handling operations on sequences with constraints. The official solution confirmed the effectiveness of the approach I took, with minor differences in loop constructs. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding constraints and optimizing search ranges to ensure performance remains within acceptable limits.

If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
    Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
    Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).

    The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
    The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
    The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The problem involves two types of operations: jumping to the next higher element within a constraint and updating a range of elements. This is a common pattern in competitive programming and can be applied to problems involving range queries and updates, such as those that can be solved using segment trees or binary indexed trees. Understanding how to efficiently handle these operations is crucial in optimizing performance for large datasets, especially when the number of operations is large.",
