INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.

## Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a prefix sum approach with a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of the number of times a particular prefix sum has occurred. The idea is to iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum (prefix sum). For each element, we check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current running sum, equals `k`. If such a prefix sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We count all such subarrays. We also update the hash map with the current prefix sum.

## Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0
   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle cases where subarray starts from index 0
   Initialize `current_sum` to 0
   Initialize `count` to 0

   For each number `num` in `nums`:
       Add `num` to `current_sum`
       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`
       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:
           Add the count of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`
       Increment the count of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`

   Return `count`
   ```

## Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums
        prefix_sum_count = {0: 1}
        current_sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate over each number in the array
        for num in nums:
            # Update the current prefix sum
            current_sum += num
            
            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k
            needed_sum = current_sum - k
            
            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are
            # subarrays ending at the current index which sum to k
            if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:
                count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]
            
            # Update the prefix_sum_count with the current prefix sum
            if current_sum in prefix_sum_count:
                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1
            else:
                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] = 1
        
        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum equal to k
        return count
```

This solution efficiently finds the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a prefix sum approach with a hash map to track the frequency of prefix sums. This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        To solve the problem of finding the number of "nice" subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers, we can use a sliding window approach with a hash map to efficiently count the subarrays. Here's how we can break down the problem and solution:

        ### 1. Restate the Problem
        We need to find the number of contiguous subarrays within a given array `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

        ### 2. Conceptualize a Solution
        - **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify which numbers in the array are odd.
        - **Use a Prefix Sum Approach**: We can use a prefix sum approach to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far as we iterate through the array.
        - **Count Subarrays with Exactly `k` Odd Numbers**: For each position in the array, we can determine how many subarrays end at that position and contain exactly `k` odd numbers by using a hash map to store the count of prefix sums.

        ### 3. Pseudocode Solution
        1. Initialize a hash map `count` to store the frequency of prefix sums, starting with `count[0] = 1` to handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning.
        2. Initialize `odd_count` to 0 to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.
        3. Initialize `result` to 0 to store the number of nice subarrays.
        4. Iterate over each number in `nums`:
           - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.
           - If `odd_count - k` exists in `count`, it means there are subarrays ending at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers. Add the frequency of `odd_count - k` to `result`.
           - Update the frequency of `odd_count` in `count`.
        5. Return `result`.

        ### 4. Final Python Solution
        ```python
        from typing import List
        from collections import defaultdict

        class Solution:
            def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
                # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums
                count = defaultdict(int)
                count[0] = 1  # To handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning
        
                odd_count = 0  # To keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered
                result = 0  # To store the number of nice subarrays
        
                for num in nums:
                    # Increment odd_count if the current number is odd
                    if num % 2 == 1:
                        odd_count += 1
            
                    # If there exists a prefix with odd_count - k, it means there are subarrays
                    # ending at the current position with exactly k odd numbers
                    if odd_count - k in count:
                        result += count[odd_count - k]
            
                    # Update the frequency of the current odd_count
                    count[odd_count] += 1
        
                return result
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code
        - We use a hash map `count` to store the frequency of each prefix sum of odd numbers.
        - `odd_count` keeps track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.
        - For each number in `nums`, we update `odd_count` and check if there is a prefix sum that would result in exactly `k` odd numbers in the current subarray.
        - The solution efficiently counts the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers using a single pass through the array, resulting in an O(n) time complexity.

    [description]
    The function calculates the number of contiguous subarrays within a given list of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of prefix sums of odd numbers encountered so far. As it iterates through the list, it increments a counter whenever an odd number is found and checks if there is a previously seen prefix sum that would result in a subarray with exactly `k` odd numbers. If such a prefix sum exists, it adds the frequency of that prefix sum to the result. The function returns the total count of such subarrays.

    [end of description]
    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to find subarrays with specific properties, such as a certain number of odd numbers, within a larger array. This problem is a classic example of using prefix sums and hash maps to efficiently count subarrays that meet a given condition, which is a common task in competitive programming and algorithm design. The solution demonstrates how to use a hash map to store the frequency of prefix sums, allowing for quick lookup and update operations. This technique can be applied to other problems involving subarray sums or counts, especially when dealing with large arrays where a brute force approach would be inefficient.

[/Reference Code (Not callable)]


[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding the number of "nice" subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers, I utilized a sliding window approach combined with a prefix sum strategy. The core concept was to efficiently count subarrays by tracking the number of odd numbers encountered as we iterate through the array. This was achieved using a hash map to store the frequency of prefix sums of odd numbers.

    The key steps involved:
    1. **Prefix Sum of Odd Numbers**: By maintaining a running count of odd numbers (`odd_count`), we could determine how many subarrays end at each position with exactly `k` odd numbers.
    2. **Hash Map for Frequency Counting**: A hash map (`count`) was used to store the frequency of each prefix sum, allowing us to quickly check how many subarrays have the required number of odd numbers.
    3. **Single Pass Efficiency**: The solution was designed to work in O(n) time complexity by making a single pass through the array, updating the hash map and result as we go.

    This approach was effective and passed all test cases, demonstrating the power of combining prefix sums with hash maps for efficient subarray counting. The problem reinforced the utility of these techniques in handling subarray problems with specific constraints.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution in Plain English:**

   To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a prefix sum approach combined with a hash map. The idea is to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array. For each element, we calculate the cumulative sum up to that point. We then check if there is a previous cumulative sum such that the difference between the current cumulative sum and this previous sum equals `k`. If such a previous sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We use a hash map to store the frequency of each cumulative sum encountered so far, which allows us to quickly determine how many such subarrays exist.

3. **Pseudocode Solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a hash map `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0
   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle subarrays starting from the beginning
   Initialize `current_sum` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative sum
   Initialize `count` to 0 to store the number of subarrays with sum equal to k

   For each number `num` in `nums`:
       Add `num` to `current_sum`
       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`
       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:
           Add the frequency of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`
       Increment the frequency of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`

   Return `count`
   ```

 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English:**

   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution in Plain English:**

   To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a prefix sum approach combined with a hash map. The idea is to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array. For each element, we calculate the cumulative sum up to that point. We then check if there is a previous cumulative sum such that the difference between the current cumulative sum and this previous sum equals `k`. If such a previous sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We use a hash map to store the frequency of each cumulative sum encountered so far, which allows us to quickly determine how many such subarrays exist.

3. **Pseudocode Solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a hash map `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0
   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle subarrays starting from the beginning
   Initialize `current_sum` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative sum
   Initialize `count` to 0 to store the number of subarrays with sum equal to k

   For each number `num` in `nums`:
       Add `num` to `current_sum`
       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`
       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:
           Add the frequency of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`
       Increment the frequency of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`

   Return `count`
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums combined with a hash map to efficiently track and count subarrays with the desired sum. This approach leverages the idea that if the difference between the current cumulative sum and a previous cumulative sum equals `k`, then the subarray between these two points sums to `k`.

The strategy that worked involved maintaining a running cumulative sum as we iterate through the array and using a hash map to store the frequency of each cumulative sum encountered. This allows for quick lookups to determine how many subarrays end at the current position with a sum equal to `k`. The hash map is initialized with a count of 1 for a sum of 0 to handle subarrays that start from the beginning of the array.

The solution was efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), as it only required a single pass through the array. This approach is particularly useful for problems involving subarray sums, as it avoids the need for nested loops, which would result in a less efficient O(n^2) solution.

Overall, this problem reinforced the utility of prefix sums and hash maps in solving subarray sum problems efficiently.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] The problem of finding the number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals a given integer `k` was effectively solved using a prefix sum approach combined with a hash map. The official solution aligns closely with the approach I implemented, and both solutions share the same time complexity of O(n), which is optimal for this problem.

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Prefix Sum and Hash Map Usage**: Both solutions utilize a prefix sum to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array. A hash map is used to store the frequency of each prefix sum encountered. This allows for quick lookups to determine how many subarrays with the desired sum exist up to the current index.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The hash map is initialized with a key-value pair of `0: 1` to handle cases where a subarray starting from the beginning of the array sums to `k`. This ensures that subarrays starting from the first element are correctly counted.

3. **Incremental Updates**: As we iterate through the array, we update the cumulative sum and check if the difference between the current cumulative sum and `k` exists in the hash map. If it does, it indicates that there are subarrays ending at the current index with a sum equal to `k`. The frequency of the current cumulative sum is then updated in the hash map.

Overall, the official solution is concise and effectively implements the prefix sum and hash map strategy. The approach is robust and handles all edge cases efficiently, making it a reliable solution for this problem.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] The function calculates the number of continuous subarrays within a list of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of prefix sums encountered as it iterates through the list. For each element, it updates the current cumulative sum and checks if there exists a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current sum, equals `k`. If such a prefix sum exists, it increments the count by the frequency of that prefix sum. The function returns the total count of subarrays whose sum equals `k`.

[Problem]
    Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

    Example 1:

    Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
    Output: 2



    Note:

    The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
    The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].
[/Problem]

[Solution]

    from typing import List
    from collections import defaultdict

    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums
            prefix_sum_count = defaultdict(int)
            prefix_sum_count[0] = 1  # To handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning

            current_sum = 0  # To keep track of the cumulative sum
            count = 0  # To store the number of subarrays with sum equal to k

            for num in nums:
                # Update the current cumulative sum
                current_sum += num
            
                # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k
                needed_sum = current_sum - k
            
                # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are subarrays
                # ending at the current position with sum equal to k
                if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:
                    count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]
            
                # Update the frequency of the current cumulative sum
                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1

            return count
