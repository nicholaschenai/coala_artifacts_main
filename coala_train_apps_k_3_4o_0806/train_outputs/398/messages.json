Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.\n\n## Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a prefix sum approach with a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of the number of times a particular prefix sum has occurred. The idea is to iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum (prefix sum). For each element, we check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current running sum, equals `k`. If such a prefix sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We count all such subarrays. We also update the hash map with the current prefix sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a dictionary `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0\n   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle cases where subarray starts from index 0\n   Initialize `current_sum` to 0\n   Initialize `count` to 0\n\n   For each number `num` in `nums`:\n       Add `num` to `current_sum`\n       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`\n       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:\n           Add the count of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`\n       Increment the count of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`\n\n   Return `count`\n   ```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums\n        prefix_sum_count = {0: 1}\n        current_sum = 0\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each number in the array\n        for num in nums:\n            # Update the current prefix sum\n            current_sum += num\n            \n            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k\n            needed_sum = current_sum - k\n            \n            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are\n            # subarrays ending at the current index which sum to k\n            if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:\n                count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]\n            \n            # Update the prefix_sum_count with the current prefix sum\n            if current_sum in prefix_sum_count:\n                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1\n            else:\n                prefix_sum_count[current_sum] = 1\n        \n        # Return the total count of subarrays with sum equal to k\n        return count\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a prefix sum approach with a hash map to track the frequency of prefix sums. This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array."

Restate the Problem\n        We need to find the number of contiguous subarrays within a given array `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.\n\n        ### 2.

Initialize a hash map `count` to store the frequency of prefix sums, starting with `count[0] = 1` to handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning.\n        2. Initialize `odd_count` to 0 to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.\n        3. Initialize `result` to 0 to store the number of nice subarrays.\n        4. Iterate over each number in `nums`:\n           - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.\n           - If `odd_count - k` exists in `count`, it means there are subarrays ending at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers. Add the frequency of `odd_count - k` to `result`.\n           - Update the frequency of `odd_count` in `count`.\n        5. Return `result`.\n\n        ### 4.
