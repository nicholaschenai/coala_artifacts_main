    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English:**\n\n   We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a Solution in Plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a prefix sum approach combined with a hash map. The idea is to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array. For each element, we calculate the cumulative sum up to that point. We then check if there is a previous cumulative sum such that the difference between the current cumulative sum and this previous sum equals `k`. If such a previous sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We use a hash map to store the frequency of each cumulative sum encountered so far, which allows us to quickly determine how many such subarrays exist.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a hash map `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0\n   Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle subarrays starting from the beginning\n   Initialize `current_sum` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative sum\n   Initialize `count` to 0 to store the number of subarrays with sum equal to k\n\n   For each number `num` in `nums`:\n       Add `num` to `current_sum`\n       Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`\n       If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:\n           Add the frequency of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`\n       Increment the frequency of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`\n\n   Return `count`\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python Solution with Comments:**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums\n        prefix_sum_count = defaultdict(int)\n        prefix_sum_count[0] = 1  # To handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning\n\n        current_sum = 0  # To keep track of the cumulative sum\n        count = 0  # To store the number of subarrays with sum equal to k\n\n        for num in nums:\n            # Update the current cumulative sum\n            current_sum += num\n            \n            # Calculate the needed sum to form a subarray with sum k\n            needed_sum = current_sum - k\n            \n            # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are subarrays\n            # ending at the current position with sum equal to k\n            if needed_sum in prefix_sum_count:\n                count += prefix_sum_count[needed_sum]\n            \n            # Update the frequency of the current cumulative sum\n            prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1\n\n        return count\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently counts the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a single pass through the array, resulting in an O(n) time complexity. The use of a hash map allows for quick lookups and updates of prefix sums.",
