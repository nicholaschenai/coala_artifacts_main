## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters. We can perform at most one operation where we remove a character from any position in the string and insert it back at any other position. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing this operation.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to rearrange the string by moving one character to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order.
2. **Approach**:
   - For each character in the string, consider removing it and inserting it at every other position.
   - For each possible new string, check if it is the smallest lexicographically.
   - Keep track of the smallest string found.
3. **Optimization Insight**: Since we are allowed only one move, the optimal strategy is to find the smallest character that can be moved to the front or to a position where it results in a smaller string.

## Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer `N` and the string `S`.
   - Initialize `min_string` as the original string `S`.
   - For each character in `S`:
     - Remove the character and try inserting it at every other position.
     - Form the new string and compare it with `min_string`.
     - If the new string is smaller, update `min_string`.
   - After checking all possibilities, store the `min_string` as the result for this test case.
3. Print the results for all test cases.

## Python Code

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    
    for i in range(T):
        N, S = test_cases[i]
        min_string = S
        
        # Try removing each character and inserting it at every other position
        for j in range(N):
            for k in range(N):
                if j != k:
                    # Create a new string by removing S[j] and inserting it at position k
                    new_string = S[:j] + S[j+1:]
                    new_string = new_string[:k] + S[j] + new_string[k:]
                    
                    # Update min_string if the new string is smaller
                    if new_string < min_string:
                        min_string = new_string
        
        results.append(min_string)
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []

for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    S = data[index + 1]
    test_cases.append((N, S))
    index += 2

# Get results
results = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` processes each test case independently.
- For each character in the string, it attempts to remove and reinsert it at every other position.
- It keeps track of the smallest string found during these operations.
- Finally, it outputs the smallest string for each test case.

    [Previous Critique]:
        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `remove_abc_pairs()` was defined but never called. In Python, simply defining a function does not execute it; it must be explicitly called to run.

        ### Steps to Correct the Code

        1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the function `remove_abc_pairs()` is called after its definition so that it executes and processes the input.
        2. **Standard Input/Output**: Verify that the function correctly reads from standard input and writes to standard output, as required by the problem statement.

        ### Revised Solution

        To fix the issue, we need to call the function after defining it. Here's the corrected code:

        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                s = data[i]
                while 'abc' in s:
                    s = s.replace('abc', '', 1)
                results.append(s)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the function to execute it
        remove_abc_pairs()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Correction

        - **Function Call**: The function `remove_abc_pairs()` is now called at the end of the script. This ensures that the function is executed when the script runs.
        - **Input Handling**: The function reads input using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments where input is provided all at once.
        - **Output Handling**: The function prints each result line by line, which matches the expected output format. 

        This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the given test cases.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We are given a string consisting of lowercase English alphabets. The task is to repeatedly remove any occurrence of the substring "abc" from the string until no such substring remains. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Iterative Removal**: For each test case, we will iteratively search for the substring "abc" in the given string. If found, we will remove it and continue searching in the newly formed string.
        2. **Repeat Until Stable**: We will repeat the process until the string no longer contains the substring "abc".
        3. **Output the Result**: Once no more "abc" substrings can be removed, we will output the final string.

        ### Pseudocode

        1. Read the number of test cases, `T`.
        2. For each test case:
           - Initialize the string `s` with the input string.
           - While "abc" is found in `s`:
             - Remove the first occurrence of "abc" from `s`.
           - Output the resulting string `s`.

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                s = data[i]
                while 'abc' in s:
                    s = s.replace('abc', '', 1)
                results.append(s)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - We read all input data at once and split it into a list `data`.
        - The first element of `data` is the number of test cases `T`.
        - For each test case, we initialize the string `s` with the corresponding input string.
        - We use a `while` loop to repeatedly check for the presence of "abc" in `s`. If found, we remove the first occurrence using `s.replace('abc', '', 1)`.
        - Once no more "abc" substrings are found, we append the resulting string to the `results` list.
        - Finally, we print each result from the `results` list.

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The problem with the current solution is likely related to how the input is being read and processed. The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads from standard input and processes the data is never executed. This is a common issue when dealing with standard input/output in competitive programming environments.

        ### Steps to Fix the Issue

        1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` should be called to execute the logic.
        2. **Check Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly from standard input and processed as expected.
        3. **Output the Result**: Make sure the result is printed to standard output.

        ### Revised Solution

        To address these issues, we need to ensure that the function is called and that the input/output is handled correctly. Here's the revised solution:

        ```python
        def min_moves_to_sort_books():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            N = int(data[0])
            books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
            def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
                low, high = 0, len(lis)
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if lis[mid] < book:
                        low = mid + 1
                    else:
                        high = mid
                return low
    
            lis = []
            for book in books:
                pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
                if pos == len(lis):
                    lis.append(book)
                else:
                    lis[pos] = book
    
            min_moves = N - len(lis)
            print(min_moves)

        # Call the function to execute the solution
        min_moves_to_sort_books()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes

        - **Function Call**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings, which are then processed to extract the number of books and their current order.
        - **Output**: The result is printed directly to standard output, which is expected in competitive programming environments.

        These changes should ensure that the solution reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the correct result.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly. Here's the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def min_moves_to_sort_books():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            N = int(data[0])
            books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
            def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
                low, high = 0, len(lis)
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if lis[mid] < book:
                        low = mid + 1
                    else:
                        high = mid
                return low
    
            lis = []
            for book in books:
                pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
                if pos == len(lis):
                    lis.append(book)
                else:
                    lis[pos] = book
    
            min_moves = N - len(lis)
            print(min_moves)

        # Call the function to execute the solution
        min_moves_to_sort_books()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **Function Call**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings, which are then processed to extract the number of books and their current order.
        - **Binary Search for LIS**: A helper function `binary_search_lis` is used to find the position where a book can be placed in the `lis` to maintain the increasing order.
        - **Building the LIS**: We iterate over each book and use the helper function to determine where it fits in the `lis`. If the position is at the end of `lis`, we append the book; otherwise, we replace the existing element at that position.
        - **Output**: The result, which is the minimum number of moves, is printed directly to standard output. 

        These changes ensure that the solution reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the correct result.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string of uppercase English letters and we can perform one operation: remove a character from any position and insert it back at any other position in the string. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing at most one such operation. We need to do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible. We can iterate through the string to find the first character that is greater than a character that comes after it. We then move this smaller character to the position before the larger character. If the string is already in non-decreasing order, no operation is needed.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
       for each test case:
           read N and S
           initialize min_string as S
           for i from 0 to N-1:
               for j from i+1 to N:
                   if S[j] < S[i]:
                       create a new string by moving S[j] to position i
                       if new string is lexicographically smaller than min_string:
                           update min_string
           print min_string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        S = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        # Initialize the minimum string as the original string
        min_string = S
        
        # Try to find a better string by moving one character
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if S[j] < S[i]:

                    new_string = S[:i] + S[j] + S[i:j] + S[j+1:]
                    # Update min_string if the new string is smaller
                    if new_string < min_string:

        results.append(min_string)
    
    # Print all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution iterates over each test case, checks all possible single-character moves, and updates the minimum string found. It then prints the smallest string for each test case.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is not called, the input won't be processed.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is defined but never called. This is why no output is produced.

3. **Logic for Finding the Smallest String:**
   - The logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character is correct. It iterates over all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` and checks if moving `S[j]` to position `i` results in a smaller string.

4. **Output:**
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct.

**Steps to Fix:**

- Ensure the function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is called so that the input is processed and output is generated.

Here's the corrected code with the function call added:

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():

        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(min_string)
    
    # Print all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the solution

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string of uppercase English letters and we can perform one operation: remove a character from any position and insert it back at any other position in the string. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing at most one such operation. We need to do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible. We can iterate through the string to find the first character that is greater than a character that comes after it. We then move this smaller character to the position before the larger character. If the string is already in non-decreasing order, no operation is needed.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
       for each test case:
           read N and S
           initialize min_string as S
           for i from 0 to N-1:
               for j from i+1 to N:
                   if S[j] < S[i]:
                       create a new string by moving S[j] to position i
                       if new string is lexicographically smaller than min_string:
                           update min_string
           print min_string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        S = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        # Initialize the minimum string as the original string
        min_string = S
        
        # Try to find a better string by moving one character
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if S[j] < S[i]:
                    # Create a new string by moving S[j] to position i
                    new_string = S[:i] + S[j] + S[i:j] + S[j+1:]
                    # Update min_string if the new string is smaller
                    if new_string < min_string:
                        min_string = new_string
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(min_string)
    
    # Print all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution iterates over each test case, checks all possible single-character moves, and updates the minimum string found. It then prints the smallest string for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is not called, the input won't be processed.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is defined but never called. This is why no output is produced.

3. **Logic for Finding the Smallest String:**
   - The logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character is correct. It iterates over all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` and checks if moving `S[j]` to position `i` results in a smaller string.

4. **Output:**
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct.

**Steps to Fix:**

- Ensure the function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is called so that the input is processed and output is generated.

Here's the corrected code with the function call added:

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        S = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        # Initialize the minimum string as the original string
        min_string = S
        
        # Try to find a better string by moving one character
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if S[j] < S[i]:
                    # Create a new string by moving S[j] to position i
                    new_string = S[:i] + S[j] + S[i:j] + S[j+1:]
                    # Update min_string if the new string is smaller
                    if new_string < min_string:
                        min_string = new_string
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(min_string)
    
    # Print all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a sequence of books using the concept of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The key insight was that the books already in the correct order form the LIS, and the rest need to be moved. Thus, the minimum moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: This problem leverages the LIS to identify the maximum subset of books that are already in the correct order. The length of the LIS helps determine how many books are already sorted.
    - **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the position to insert each book in the LIS, a binary search is used. This ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not called, which led to no output. Ensuring the function is executed by calling it at the end of the script fixed this issue.
    - **Efficient LIS Calculation**: Using a binary search to maintain the LIS allowed the solution to handle the upper constraint of 200,000 books efficiently.

    ### Code Snippet
    Here's the core logic for calculating the minimum moves using the LIS:

    ```python
    def min_moves_to_sort_books():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        N = int(data[0])
        books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
        def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
            low, high = 0, len(lis)
            while low < high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if lis[mid] < book:
                    low = mid + 1
                else:
                    high = mid
            return low
    
        lis = []
        for book in books:
            pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
            if pos == len(lis):
                lis.append(book)
            else:
                lis[pos] = book
    
        min_moves = N - len(lis)
        print(min_moves)

    min_moves_to_sort_books()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly handling input/output in competitive programming and the utility of the LIS in solving sorting-related problems efficiently.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to iteratively remove the substring "abc" from a given string until no such substring remains, and to do this for multiple test cases. The core concept here was to use a loop to repeatedly search and remove the substring "abc" from the string.

    Initially, the function was defined correctly but was not called, which led to no output being produced. This highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed by explicitly calling them, especially in a script that relies on standard input and output.

    The solution involved reading all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is suitable for competitive programming environments. The `replace` method was used to remove the first occurrence of "abc" in each iteration, and the process was repeated until the string was stable (i.e., no more "abc" substrings were found).

    The key takeaway from this exercise is the importance of function calls in script execution and the effective use of string manipulation methods to solve iterative removal problems. This approach can be applied to similar problems where a specific pattern needs to be removed from a string repeatedly.
[/Summary]


[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

        -----Constraints:-----
        $T \leq 2 $
        $1 \leq String length \leq 1000 $

        -----Sample Input:-----
        2
        aabcc
        bababccc

        -----Sample Output:-----
        ac
        bc

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        For 1) after removing "abc" at middle we get a new string as ac.
        For 2) string = bababccc
        newString1 = babcc  // After removing middle "abc"
        newString2 = bc   //After removing "abc"
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `remove_abc_pairs()` was defined but never called. In Python, simply defining a function does not execute it; it must be explicitly called to run.

        ### Steps to Correct the Code

        1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the function `remove_abc_pairs()` is called after its definition so that it executes and processes the input.
        2. **Standard Input/Output**: Verify that the function correctly reads from standard input and writes to standard output, as required by the problem statement.

        ### Revised Solution

        To fix the issue, we need to call the function after defining it. Here's the corrected code:

        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                s = data[i]
                while 'abc' in s:
                    s = s.replace('abc', '', 1)
                results.append(s)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the function to execute it
        remove_abc_pairs()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Correction

        - **Function Call**: The function `remove_abc_pairs()` is now called at the end of the script. This ensures that the function is executed when the script runs.
        - **Input Handling**: The function reads input using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments where input is provided all at once.
        - **Output Handling**: The function prints each result line by line, which matches the expected output format. 

        This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the given test cases.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string of uppercase English letters and we can perform one operation: remove a character from any position and insert it back at any other position in the string. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing at most one such operation. We need to do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible. We can iterate through the string to find the first character that is greater than a character that comes after it. We then move this smaller character to the position before the larger character. If the string is already in non-decreasing order, no operation is needed.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
       for each test case:
           read N and S
           initialize min_string as S

                       create a new string by moving S[j] to position i
                       if new string is lexicographically smaller than min_string:

This solution iterates over each test case, checks all possible single-character moves, and updates the minimum string found. It then prints the smallest string for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is not called, the input won't be processed.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is defined but never called. This is why no output is produced.

3. **Logic for Finding the Smallest String:**
   - The logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character is correct. It iterates over all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` and checks if moving `S[j]` to position `i` results in a smaller string.

4. **Output:**
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct.

**Steps to Fix:**

- Ensure the function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is called so that the input is processed and output is generated.

Here's the corrected code with the function call added:

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        S = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        # Initialize the minimum string as the original string
        min_string = S
        
        # Try to find a better string by moving one character
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if S[j] < S[i]:
                    # Create a new string by moving S[j] to position i
                    new_string = S[:i] + S[j] + S[i:j] + S[j+1:]
                    # Update min_string if the new string is smaller
                    if new_string < min_string:
                        min_string = new_string
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(min_string)
    
    # Print all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing at most one operation of moving a character within the string. The key insight was to identify the smallest character that could be moved to an earlier position to achieve a smaller string. The solution involved iterating over all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `j > i` and checking if moving `S[j]` to position `i` results in a smaller string.

Initially, the function was defined but not called, which led to no output being produced. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by ensuring the function was called at the end of the script. This experience reinforced the importance of verifying that all parts of the code, especially function calls, are correctly implemented to ensure the program executes as intended.

The solution effectively used nested loops to explore all possible single-character moves and updated the minimum string found. This approach worked well within the constraints, as the maximum string length was 50, making the O(N^2) complexity feasible. This problem highlighted the importance of understanding string manipulation and lexicographical order, which are common themes in competitive programming.

        results.append(min_string)
    
    # Print all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution iterates over each test case, checks all possible single-character moves, and updates the minimum string found. It then prints the smallest string for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is not called, the input won't be processed.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is defined but never called. This is why no output is produced.

3. **Logic for Finding the Smallest String:**
   - The logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character is correct. It iterates over all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` and checks if moving `S[j]` to position `i` results in a smaller string.

4. **Output:**
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct.

**Steps to Fix:**

- Ensure the function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is called so that the input is processed and output is generated.

Here's the corrected code with the function call added:

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        S = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        
        # Initialize the minimum string as the original string
        min_string = S
        
        # Try to find a better string by moving one character
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if S[j] < S[i]:
                    # Create a new string by moving S[j] to position i
                    new_string = S[:i] + S[j] + S[i:j] + S[j+1:]
                    # Update min_string if the new string is smaller
                    if new_string < min_string:
                        min_string = new_string
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(min_string)
    
    # Print all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the solution
find_lexicographically_smallest_string()

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, there are a few key insights and takeaways:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task was to find the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character. The problem required careful consideration of string manipulation and comparison.

2. **Initial Approach:**
   - My initial approach involved iterating over all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` to find a smaller character that could be moved to an earlier position. This approach was correct in logic but failed to execute because the function was not called.

3. **Official Solution Insights:**
   - The official solution uses a more straightforward approach by iterating over each character, removing it, and trying to insert it at every possible position in the remaining string. This method ensures that all possible single-character moves are considered.
   - The use of `min()` to continuously update the smallest string found is a concise and effective way to maintain the best result.

4. **Key Learnings:**
   - Always ensure that functions are called to execute the logic, especially in environments where input/output is handled through standard IO.
   - The official solution's approach of systematically trying all possible insertions is a robust way to ensure all potential configurations are considered.
   - Using built-in functions like `min()` can simplify the process of finding the optimal solution.

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of thorough testing and the utility of built-in functions for concise and effective problem-solving.

[Problem]
    You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

    Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

    -----Input-----
    The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
    The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
    The second line contains the string S.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
    - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
    - S will consist of uppercase English letters.

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    2
    4
    DCBA
    7
    XYZZYZZ

    Output:
    ADCB
    XYYZZZZ

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
    Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ
