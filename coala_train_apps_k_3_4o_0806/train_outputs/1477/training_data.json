    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing at most one operation of moving a character within the string. The key insight was to identify the smallest character that could be moved to an earlier position to achieve a smaller string. The solution involved iterating over all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `j > i` and checking if moving `S[j]` to position `i` results in a smaller string.\n\nInitially, the function was defined but not called, which led to no output being produced. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by ensuring the function was called at the end of the script. This experience reinforced the importance of verifying that all parts of the code, especially function calls, are correctly implemented to ensure the program executes as intended.\n\nThe solution effectively used nested loops to explore all possible single-character moves and updated the minimum string found. This approach worked well within the constraints, as the maximum string length was 50, making the O(N^2) complexity feasible. This problem highlighted the importance of understanding string manipulation and lexicographical order, which are common themes in competitive programming.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, there are a few key insights and takeaways:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The task was to find the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character. The problem required careful consideration of string manipulation and comparison.\n\n2. **Initial Approach:**\n   - My initial approach involved iterating over all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` to find a smaller character that could be moved to an earlier position. This approach was correct in logic but failed to execute because the function was not called.\n\n3. **Official Solution Insights:**\n   - The official solution uses a more straightforward approach by iterating over each character, removing it, and trying to insert it at every possible position in the remaining string. This method ensures that all possible single-character moves are considered.\n   - The use of `min()` to continuously update the smallest string found is a concise and effective way to maintain the best result.\n\n4. **Key Learnings:**\n   - Always ensure that functions are called to execute the logic, especially in environments where input/output is handled through standard IO.\n   - The official solution's approach of systematically trying all possible insertions is a robust way to ensure all potential configurations are considered.\n   - Using built-in functions like `min()` can simplify the process of finding the optimal solution.\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of thorough testing and the utility of built-in functions for concise and effective problem-solving.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_lexicographically_smallest_string]\nThe function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string. For each string, it attempts to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by moving one character to an earlier position in the string. It iterates over all possible pairs of positions in the string, checking if moving a character results in a smaller string, and updates the minimum string accordingly. The results for each test case are collected and printed at the end.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to rearrange characters in a string to achieve the smallest possible lexicographical order with minimal operations. This can be applied in text processing, data sorting, and optimization problems where constraints limit the number of operations. Understanding how to efficiently find the smallest lexicographical order by moving a single character can be beneficial in competitive programming and algorithm design, especially when dealing with constraints on operations and input size."
