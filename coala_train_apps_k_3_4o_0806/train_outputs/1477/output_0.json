    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a string of uppercase English letters and we can perform one operation: remove a character from any position and insert it back at any other position in the string. Our goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing at most one such operation. We need to do this for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we should try to move the smallest character as close to the beginning of the string as possible. We can iterate through the string to find the first character that is greater than a character that comes after it. We then move this smaller character to the position before the larger character. If the string is already in non-decreasing order, no operation is needed.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(T, test_cases):\n       for each test case:\n           read N and S\n           initialize min_string as S\n           for i from 0 to N-1:\n               for j from i+1 to N:\n                   if S[j] < S[i]:\n                       create a new string by moving S[j] to position i\n                       if new string is lexicographically smaller than min_string:\n                           update min_string\n           print min_string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_lexicographically_smallest_string():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        S = data[index + 1]\n        index += 2\n        \n        # Initialize the minimum string as the original string\n        min_string = S\n        \n        # Try to find a better string by moving one character\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(i + 1, N):\n                if S[j] < S[i]:\n                    # Create a new string by moving S[j] to position i\n                    new_string = S[:i] + S[j] + S[i:j] + S[j+1:]\n                    # Update min_string if the new string is smaller\n                    if new_string < min_string:\n                        min_string = new_string\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(min_string)\n    \n    # Print all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each test case, checks all possible single-character moves, and updates the minimum string found. It then prints the smallest string for each test case.",
