    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no such sequence exists. We then return the resulting string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We can use a stack to help manage the removal of adjacent duplicates.\n   - As we iterate through the string, we will keep track of characters and their counts using the stack.\n   - For each character in the string:\n     - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.\n     - If the count reaches `k`, we pop the character from the stack, effectively removing it from the string.\n     - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.\n   - After processing all characters, the stack will contain the characters of the final string with their counts.\n   - We then reconstruct the final string from the stack.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function removeDuplicates(s, k):\n       Initialize an empty stack\n       For each character in s:\n           If stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:\n               Increment the count of the top character\n               If count equals k:\n                   Pop the character from the stack\n           Else:\n               Push the character and count 1 onto the stack\n       Initialize an empty result string\n       For each character and count in the stack:\n           Append character repeated count times to the result string\n       Return the result string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        # Initialize a stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n        stack = []\n        \n        # Iterate over each character in the string\n        for char in s:\n            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character\n                stack[-1][1] += 1  # Increment the count of the top character\n                if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                    # If the count reaches k, pop the character from the stack\n                    stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # If the stack is empty or the top character is different, push the current character with count 1\n                stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n        # Initialize an empty result string\n        result = \"\"\n        \n        # Reconstruct the final string from the stack\n        for char, count in stack:\n            result += char * count  # Append the character repeated 'count' times\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution uses a stack to efficiently manage the removal of adjacent duplicates, ensuring that the final string is constructed correctly after all possible removals.",
