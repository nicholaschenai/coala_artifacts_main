## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
Example 2:
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
Example 3:
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
2 <= k <= 10^4
s only contains lower case English letters.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        
```

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. The goal is to return the final string after all possible removals have been made.

## Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We can use a stack to help us keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string.
   - For each character in the string, we check if it matches the character at the top of the stack.
   - If it matches, we increment the count of that character.
   - If the count reaches `k`, we remove that character from the stack.
   - If it doesn't match, we push the new character onto the stack with a count of 1.
   - After processing all characters, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.

## Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   For each character in the string:
       If the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack has the same character:
           Increment the count of the top element
           If the count equals k:
               Pop the top element from the stack
       Else:
           Push the character with count 1 onto the stack
   Initialize an empty result string
   For each element in the stack:
       Append the character repeated by its count to the result string
   Return the result string
   ```

## Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts
        stack = []
        
        # Iterate over each character in the string
        for char in s:
            # If the stack is not empty and the top element has the same character
            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                # Increment the count of the top element
                stack[-1][1] += 1
                # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack
                if stack[-1][1] == k:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                # Push the new character with count 1 onto the stack
                stack.append([char, 1])
        
        # Initialize an empty result string
        result = ''
        # Reconstruct the string from the stack
        for char, count in stack:
            result += char * count
        
        # Return the final result string
        return result
```

This solution efficiently processes the string in a single pass, using a stack to manage the characters and their counts, ensuring that we can handle the constraints of the problem effectively.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a string that is encoded using a specific pattern: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a string that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns into their repeated forms.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           - We will use a stack to help decode the string. The stack will help us manage nested patterns.
           - As we iterate through the string:
             - If we encounter a digit, it indicates the start of a new pattern. We will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.
             - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it marks the start of an encoded string. We push it onto the stack to signify this.
             - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded string. We will pop elements from the stack until we find the matching `[`, then repeat the string the number of times specified by the number before the `[`.
             - If we encounter a letter, we add it to the current string being built.
           - Finally, the stack will contain the fully decoded string.

        3. **Pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function decodeString(s):
               stack = []
               current_string = ""
               current_number = 0

               for each character in s:
                   if character is a digit:
                       update current_number to include this digit
                   else if character is '[':
                       push current_string and current_number onto the stack
                       reset current_string and current_number
                   else if character is ']':
                       pop number from stack
                       pop previous_string from stack
                       current_string = previous_string + (current_string repeated number times)
                   else:
                       add character to current_string

               return current_string
           ```

                        # Repeat the current string 'number' times and append to the previous string
                        current_string = previous_string + current_string * number
                    else:

        This solution uses a stack to manage nested patterns and builds the decoded string by processing each character in the input string.

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, the task was to iteratively remove occurrences of the substring "abc" from a given string until no such substring remains. The solution I provided was functionally correct, but I initially forgot to call the function, which led to no output being produced. This oversight highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed, especially in competitive programming environments where input and output are handled through standard I/O.

    The official solution uses a similar approach to mine, employing a `while` loop to repeatedly remove "abc" from the string using the `replace` method. The key difference is that the official solution uses `s.count("abc") != 0` to check for the presence of "abc", while my solution used `'abc' in s`. Both methods are effective, but using `count` explicitly checks for the number of occurrences, which can be slightly more informative if needed.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively addressed the task. The main takeaway is the importance of ensuring that the function is called and that input/output handling is correctly implemented in a script. This experience reinforces the need for attention to detail in coding, especially in environments where the execution flow is not immediately visible.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English:**

           We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our task is to find the number of continuous subarrays within the array whose sum equals `k`.

        2. **Conceptualize a Solution in Plain English:**

           To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a prefix sum approach combined with a hash map. The idea is to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array. For each element, we calculate the cumulative sum up to that point. We then check if there is a previous cumulative sum such that the difference between the current cumulative sum and this previous sum equals `k`. If such a previous sum exists, it means there is a subarray ending at the current element that sums to `k`. We use a hash map to store the frequency of each cumulative sum encountered so far, which allows us to quickly determine how many such subarrays exist.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution:**

           ```
           Initialize a hash map `prefix_sum_count` with default value 0
           Set `prefix_sum_count[0]` to 1 to handle subarrays starting from the beginning
           Initialize `current_sum` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative sum
           Initialize `count` to 0 to store the number of subarrays with sum equal to k

           For each number `num` in `nums`:
               Add `num` to `current_sum`
               Calculate `needed_sum` as `current_sum - k`
               If `needed_sum` is in `prefix_sum_count`:
                   Add the frequency of `needed_sum` in `prefix_sum_count` to `count`
               Increment the frequency of `current_sum` in `prefix_sum_count`

           Return `count`
           ```

        4. **Final Python Solution with Comments:**

        ```python
        from typing import List
        from collections import defaultdict

        class Solution:
            def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
                # Dictionary to store the frequency of prefix sums

                    # If the needed sum exists in the prefix_sum_count, it means there are subarrays

                    prefix_sum_count[current_sum] += 1

                return count
        ```

        This solution efficiently counts the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k` using a single pass through the array, resulting in an O(n) time complexity. The use of a hash map allows for quick lookups and updates of prefix sums.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no such sequence exists. We then return the resulting string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We can use a stack to help manage the removal of adjacent duplicates.
   - As we iterate through the string, we will keep track of characters and their counts using the stack.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.
     - If the count reaches `k`, we pop the character from the stack, effectively removing it from the string.
     - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.
   - After processing all characters, the stack will contain the characters of the final string with their counts.
   - We then reconstruct the final string from the stack.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function removeDuplicates(s, k):
       Initialize an empty stack
       For each character in s:
           If stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:
               Increment the count of the top character
               If count equals k:
                   Pop the character from the stack
           Else:
               Push the character and count 1 onto the stack
       Initialize an empty result string
       For each character and count in the stack:
           Append character repeated count times to the result string
       Return the result string
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to efficiently remove adjacent duplicate characters from a string using a stack. The challenge was to repeatedly remove sequences of `k` identical characters until no such sequences remain. The stack data structure was ideal for this task because it allows us to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string.

The strategy that worked involved:
- Using a stack to store pairs of characters and their counts.
- Iterating through the string and updating the stack based on whether the current character matches the top of the stack.
- Removing characters from the stack when their count reaches `k`.
- Reconstructing the final string from the stack after processing all characters.

This approach efficiently handles the problem within the constraints, ensuring that the solution is both time and space efficient. The use of a stack to manage character counts was a key insight, as it allowed for easy tracking and removal of duplicates. This problem reinforced the utility of stacks in scenarios where we need to manage sequences and their properties dynamically.

        for char, count in stack:
            result += char * count  # Append the character repeated 'count' times
        
        return result
```

This solution uses a stack to efficiently manage the removal of adjacent duplicates, ensuring that the final string is constructed correctly after all possible removals.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The problem of removing `k` adjacent duplicates from a string was effectively solved using a stack-based approach. My initial solution was quite similar to the official solution, and both approaches leveraged the stack to keep track of characters and their counts. This method is efficient because it allows us to process the string in a single pass, maintaining a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.

Key insights from the official solution:
- The official solution initializes the stack with a dummy entry `['*', 0]` to simplify the logic of checking the stack's top element. This avoids the need to check if the stack is empty before accessing its top element, which can make the code slightly cleaner.
- Both solutions use a similar strategy of incrementing the count of the top character on the stack and removing it when the count reaches `k`.

Overall, the problem was straightforward, and the stack-based approach is both intuitive and efficient for this type of problem. The official solution's use of a dummy entry is a small but useful trick that can simplify stack operations in similar problems.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The function processes a string to remove adjacent duplicates that appear consecutively 'k' times. It uses a stack to keep track of characters and their consecutive counts as it iterates through the string. When a character's count reaches 'k', it is removed from the stack. After processing all characters, the function reconstructs the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count. The final string, with the specified duplicates removed, is returned as the result.

[Problem]
    Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
    We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
    Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
    Output: "abcd"
    Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
    Example 2:
    Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
    Output: "aa"
    Explanation: 
    First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
    Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
    Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
    Example 3:
    Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
    Output: "ps"

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 10^5
    2 <= k <= 10^4
    s only contains lower case English letters.
