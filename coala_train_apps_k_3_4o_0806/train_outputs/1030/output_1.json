    "raw_msg": "Let's address the problem with a more efficient approach. The key insight is to understand the path configuration between two nodes in the binary tree. The path configuration is determined by the sequence of moves needed to transform one node into another, which can be derived from their binary representations.\n\n### Correct Approach\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: The path from a node to the root can be traced using its binary representation. The path configuration between two nodes `u` and `v` is determined by their lowest common ancestor (LCA).\n\n2. **Finding LCA**: The LCA of two nodes can be found by moving both nodes up to their parents until they are equal. This is equivalent to finding the longest common prefix of their binary representations.\n\n3. **Counting Pairs**: For each query, we need to count pairs `(w, t)` such that the path configuration from `w` to `t` is the same as from `u` to `v`. This is equivalent to counting pairs with the same LCA as `u` and `v`.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of simulating paths for all pairs, use properties of binary representations to determine if two nodes have the same path configuration.\n\nHere's the revised solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_lca(u, v):\n    # Find the lowest common ancestor of u and v\n    while u != v:\n        if u > v:\n            u //= 2\n        else:\n            v //= 2\n    return u\n\ndef count_pairs_with_same_path(n, u, v):\n    # Find the LCA of u and v\n    lca = find_lca(u, v)\n    \n    # Calculate the path length from u to v\n    path_length = 0\n    while u != lca:\n        u //= 2\n        path_length += 1\n    while v != lca:\n        v //= 2\n        path_length += 1\n    \n    # Count pairs (w, t) with the same path length\n    count = 0\n    for w in range(1, n + 1):\n        for t in range(1, n + 1):\n            if w == t:\n                continue\n            lw = find_lca(w, t)\n            if lw == lca:\n                count += 1\n    \n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    Q = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(Q):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        u = int(data[index + 1])\n        v = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        result = count_pairs_with_same_path(n, u, v)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the number of pairs `(w, t)` for each query by determining the LCA of `u` and `v`, and counting pairs with the same path configuration.
