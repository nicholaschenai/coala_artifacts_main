    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a rooted binary tree with infinite nodes, where each node is labeled with an integer. The root is labeled `1`, and for any node labeled `v`, its left child is `2 * v` and its right child is `2 * v + 1`. We can move between nodes using four operations: move to the left child, move to the right child, move to the parent as a left child, and move to the parent as a right child. For any two nodes `u` and `v`, there is a unique path configuration. Given a series of queries, each with three integers `n`, `u`, and `v`, we need to count the number of pairs `(w, t)` such that the path configuration from `w` to `t` is the same as from `u` to `v`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Path Configuration**: The path configuration between two nodes in this tree can be determined by their binary representation. The path from a node to the root can be traced by repeatedly moving to the parent until reaching the root. This is equivalent to finding the binary representation of the node and tracing back to the root.\n\n2. **Common Ancestor**: The path configuration between two nodes `u` and `v` is determined by their lowest common ancestor (LCA). The path from `u` to `v` can be split into two parts: from `u` to LCA and from LCA to `v`.\n\n3. **Binary Representation**: The path from a node to the root can be represented by the binary representation of the node. The LCA of two nodes can be found by comparing their binary representations and finding the longest common prefix.\n\n4. **Counting Pairs**: For each query, we need to count pairs `(w, t)` such that the path configuration from `w` to `t` is the same as from `u` to `v`. This is equivalent to counting pairs with the same LCA as `u` and `v`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. For each query `(n, u, v)`:\n   - Find the LCA of `u` and `v`.\n   - Count the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA that are within the range `[1, n]`.\n   - The number of valid pairs `(w, t)` is the square of the number of nodes in this subtree.\n\n2. Output the result for each query.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_lca(u, v):\n    # Find the lowest common ancestor of u and v\n    while u != v:\n        if u > v:\n            u //= 2\n        else:\n            v //= 2\n    return u\n\ndef count_subtree_nodes(lca, n):\n    # Count the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at lca within the range [1, n]\n    count = 0\n    queue = [lca]\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.pop(0)\n        if node > n:\n            continue\n        count += 1\n        queue.append(2 * node)\n        queue.append(2 * node + 1)\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    Q = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(Q):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        u = int(data[index + 1])\n        v = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        lca = find_lca(u, v)\n        num_nodes = count_subtree_nodes(lca, n)\n        results.append(num_nodes * num_nodes)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code efficiently calculates the number of pairs `(w, t)` for each query by determining the LCA of `u` and `v`, counting the nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA, and then squaring this count to get the number of valid pairs.",
