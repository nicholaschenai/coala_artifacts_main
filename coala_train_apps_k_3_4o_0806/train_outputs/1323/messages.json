This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.\nThe railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.\nThe Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.\nThe minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!\nIn other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.\nFor example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:\n$ $\nStation              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 \nExpected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 \n\n$ $\nIf the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$.\n- $-10^9 \\leq p_i \\leq 10^9$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \\leq N \\leq 4000$\n- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n8\n-20\n90\n-30\n-20\n80\n-70\n-60\n125\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n-5\n6 8\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

We need to find a contiguous segment of these stations such that the sum of their profit/loss values is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same sum closest to zero, we should choose the longest one. The output should include the minimum possible profit/loss and the starting and ending indices of the segment.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of all profits/losses from the start up to station `i`. This allows us to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.\n\n2. **Finding Closest to Zero**: To find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, we need to find two prefix sums that are closest to each other. The difference between these two prefix sums will give us the sum of the subarray between them.\n\n3. **Sorting for Efficiency**: By sorting the prefix sums, we can efficiently find the two closest sums. The difference between these two sums will be minimized, and we can determine the indices of the subarray by their original positions.\n\n4. **Handling Ties**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same sum closest to zero, we choose the longest one. This can be naturally handled by checking the length of the subarray when we find two prefix sums with the same difference.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1.

The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. My initial approach used a dynamic programming array to track possible sums, which is a common technique for partition problems.\n\n    The official solution, however, uses a set to track possible sums, which is a more elegant and concise approach. Here's a breakdown of the official solution:\n\n    1. **Initialization**: Start with a set `dp` containing only the sum `0`. This set will be used to track all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones.\n\n    2. **Iterate through stones**: For each stone, update the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in `dp`. This is done using set comprehension, which efficiently updates the set with new possible sums.\n\n    3. **Calculate the result**: After processing all stones, the set `dp` contains all possible sums. The goal is to find the sum that, when doubled and subtracted from the total weight, gives the smallest possible result. This is achieved by iterating through the set and calculating the minimum of `abs(total - 2 * _sum)` for each `_sum` in `dp`.\n\n    The official solution is insightful because it leverages Python's set operations to efficiently manage and update possible sums, resulting in a more concise and potentially faster implementation compared to the traditional dynamic programming array approach. This solution is particularly elegant in its use of set comprehension to handle the sum updates in a single line, making the code both compact and easy to understand.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum\n\n    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).\n\n    ## Problem statement\n\n    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \\ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \\ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:\n\n    $$ \\max_{ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.\n    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\n    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.\n\n    ## Algorithm 1\n\n    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm is very simple.\n\n    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.\n\n    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \\ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.\n\n    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.\n\n    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.\n\n    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ \u2014 we will only need the current element from it.\n\n    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.\n\n    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        int cur = sum - min_sum;\n        if (cur > ans) {\n            ans = cur;\n            ans_l = min_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < min_sum) {\n            min_sum = sum;\n            min_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Algorithm 2\n\n    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.\n\n    **Proof:**\n\n    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum \u2014 so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.\n\n    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.\n\n    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a \"critical\" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \\ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.\n\n    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum);\n        sum = max(sum, 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        if (sum > ans) {\n            ans = sum;\n            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < 0) {\n            sum = 0;\n            minus_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum of a subsequence of Pok\u00e9mon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is done by checking the absolute difference between the current prefix sum and each previously seen prefix sum.\n\n4. **Updating Best Segment**: If a new subarray with a smaller absolute sum is found, or if the same absolute sum is found but the subarray is longer, update the best segment indices.\n\n5. **Output**: Print the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the best segment.\n\n### Revised Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_best_segment(N, profits):\n    # Dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum\n    prefix_map = {}\n    prefix_sum = 0\n    min_abs_sum = float('inf')\n    best_start = -1\n    best_end = -1\n    \n    # Initialize with prefix sum 0 at index -1\n    prefix_map[0] = -1\n    \n    for i in range(N):\n        prefix_sum += profits[i]\n        \n        # Check all previously seen prefix sums\n        for seen_prefix_sum in prefix_map:\n            current_sum = prefix_sum - seen_prefix_sum\n            start_index = prefix_map[seen_prefix_sum] + 1\n            end_index = i\n            current_length = end_index - start_index + 1\n            \n            # Check if this is the best segment\n            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and current_length > (best_end - best_start + 1)):\n                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)\n                best_start = start_index\n                best_end = end_index\n        \n        # If not seen, store the first occurrence of this prefix sum\n        if prefix_sum not in prefix_map:\n            prefix_map[prefix_sum] = i\n    \n    # Output the result\n    print(min_abs_sum)\n    print(best_start + 1, best_end + 1)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\nN = int(data[0])\nprofits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))\n\n# Call the function\nfind_best_segment(N, profits)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Prefix Sum Difference**: The code now correctly calculates the difference between the current prefix sum and each previously seen prefix sum to determine the subarray sum.\n- **Iterating Over Seen Prefix Sums**: The code iterates over all previously seen prefix sums to find the one that results in the smallest absolute subarray sum.\n- **Standard Input/Output**: The code reads from standard input and writes to standard output, which is necessary for the environment to detect the output."

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.\n    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.\n    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct fixed this issue.\n    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.\n    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n        scores = [10] * N\n        for i, j, k in questions:\n            for student in range(i, j + 1):\n                scores[student] *= k\n        total_score = sum(scores)\n        mean_score = total_score // N\n        return mean_score\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            M = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            questions = []\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i = int(data[index]) - 1\n                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n                k = int(data[index + 2])\n                index += 3\n                questions.append((i, j, k))\n            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n            results.append(result)\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was efficiently calculating the sum of subarrays for multiple queries.

For each query, we are given two indices, and we need to calculate the sum of the values between these indices (inclusive). This needs to be done for multiple test cases.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Input Parsing**: We will first read the number of test cases. For each test case, we will read the number of bills and the number of queries. Then, we will read the list of bill values and the list of queries.\n\n        2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: To efficiently calculate the sum for each query, we will use a prefix sum array. The prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n\n        3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of the array from the start up to index `i`. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray `[X, Y]` as `prefix[Y] - prefix[X-1]`.\n\n        4. **Answer Queries**: For each query, use the prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of the specified range.\n\n        5. **Output**: For each test case, output the results of all queries.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function process_test_cases():\n            read T  # number of test cases\n            for each test case:\n                read N, Q  # number of bills and number of queries\n                read bills  # list of N bill values\n                read queries  # list of Q queries, each with two indices X and Y\n\n                # Create prefix sum array\n                prefix_sum = array of size N+1 initialized to 0\n                for i from 1 to N:\n                    prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + bills[i-1]\n\n                # Process each query\n                results = []\n                for each query (X, Y):\n                    sum_value = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X-1]\n                    append sum_value to results\n\n                # Output results for the current test case\n                for result in results:\n                    print result\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def process_test_cases():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n    \n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                bills = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n        \n                queries = []\n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    X = int(data[index])\n                    Y = int(data[index + 1])\n                    queries.append((X, Y))\n                    index += 2\n        \n                # Create prefix sum array\n                prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)\n                for i in range(1, N + 1):\n                    prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]\n        \n                # Process each query\n                for X, Y in queries:\n                    sum_value = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]\n                    results.append(sum_value)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        process_test_cases()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Prefix Sum Array**: We use a prefix sum array to store cumulative sums of the bills.

This is not the case. The goal is to find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, not necessarily zero. The solution should calculate the difference between the current prefix sum and all previously seen prefix sums to find the subarray sum closest to zero.\n\n### Step-by-Step Correction\n\n1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: As we iterate through the list, maintain a running total of the prefix sum.\n\n2. **Tracking Prefix Sums**: Use a dictionary to store each prefix sum and its first occurrence index. This allows us to quickly find the length of any subarray whose sum is closest to zero.\n\n3. **Finding Closest to Zero**: For each prefix sum, check all previously seen prefix sums to find the one that, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, results in a sum closest to zero. This is done by checking the absolute difference between the current prefix sum and each previously seen prefix sum.\n\n4. **Updating Best Segment**: If a new subarray with a smaller absolute sum is found, or if the same absolute sum is found but the subarray is longer, update the best segment indices.\n\n5. **Output**: Print the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the best segment.\n\n### Revised Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_best_segment(N, profits):\n    # Dictionary to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum\n    prefix_map = {}\n    prefix_sum = 0\n    min_abs_sum = float('inf')\n    best_start = -1\n    best_end = -1\n    \n    # Initialize with prefix sum 0 at index -1\n    prefix_map[0] = -1\n    \n    for i in range(N):\n        prefix_sum += profits[i]\n        \n        # Check all previously seen prefix sums\n        for seen_prefix_sum in prefix_map:\n            current_sum = prefix_sum - seen_prefix_sum\n            start_index = prefix_map[seen_prefix_sum] + 1\n            end_index = i\n            current_length = end_index - start_index + 1\n            \n            # Check if this is the best segment\n            if abs(current_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(current_sum) == min_abs_sum and current_length > (best_end - best_start + 1)):\n                min_abs_sum = abs(current_sum)\n                best_start = start_index\n                best_end = end_index\n        \n        # If not seen, store the first occurrence of this prefix sum\n        if prefix_sum not in prefix_map:\n            prefix_map[prefix_sum] = i\n    \n    # Output the result\n    print(min_abs_sum)\n    print(best_start + 1, best_end + 1)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\nN = int(data[0])\nprofits = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))\n\n# Call the function\nfind_best_segment(N, profits)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Prefix Sum Difference**: The code now correctly calculates the difference between the current prefix sum and each previously seen prefix sum to determine the subarray sum.\n- **Iterating Over Seen Prefix Sums**: The code iterates over all previously seen prefix sums to find the one that results in the smallest absolute subarray sum.\n- **Standard Input/Output**: The code reads from standard input and writes to standard output, which is necessary for the environment to detect the output.\n\nThis solution should correctly handle the problem constraints and output the desired results."

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was efficiently calculating the sum of subarrays for multiple queries. The key strategy was to use a prefix sum array, which allows for constant time sum calculations after an initial linear time setup. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets and multiple queries, as it significantly reduces the time complexity compared to recalculating sums for each query.\n\n    The prefix sum array is constructed by iterating through the list of bills and maintaining a running total. For each query, the sum of the subarray can be quickly determined by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the range from the prefix sum at the end of the range.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of preprocessing data to enable efficient query handling, a common pattern in competitive programming and algorithm design. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered, highlighting the effectiveness of the prefix sum technique for this type of problem.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Nexus 4.O is going to be organized by ASME, GLA University.

The prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n\n        3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of the array from the start up to index `i`. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray `[X, Y]` as `prefix[Y] - prefix[X-1]`.\n\n        4. **Answer Queries**: For each query, use the prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of the specified range.\n\n        5. **Output**: For each test case, output the results of all queries.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function process_test_cases():\n            read T  # number of test cases\n            for each test case:\n                read N, Q  # number of bills and number of queries\n                read bills  # list of N bill values\n                read queries  # list of Q queries, each with two indices X and Y\n\n                # Create prefix sum array\n                prefix_sum = array of size N+1 initialized to 0\n                for i from 1 to N:\n                    prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + bills[i-1]\n\n                # Process each query\n                results = []\n                for each query (X, Y):\n                    sum_value = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X-1]\n                    append sum_value to results\n\n                # Output results for the current test case\n                for result in results:\n                    print result\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def process_test_cases():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n    \n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                Q = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                bills = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n        \n                queries = []\n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    X = int(data[index])\n                    Y = int(data[index + 1])\n                    queries.append((X, Y))\n                    index += 2\n        \n                # Create prefix sum array\n                prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)\n                for i in range(1, N + 1):\n                    prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]\n        \n                # Process each query\n                for X, Y in queries:\n                    sum_value = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]\n                    results.append(sum_value)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        process_test_cases()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Prefix Sum Array**: We use a prefix sum array to store cumulative sums of the bills.

        "content": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\nThe problem involves finding a contiguous subarray of station profits/losses such that the sum of the subarray is closest to zero. The challenge is to efficiently find this subarray given the constraints, where the number of stations can be as large as 100,000.\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n1. **Prefix Sum Technique**: The key to solving this problem efficiently is using the prefix sum technique. By maintaining a running total of the profits/losses, we can quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.\n\n2. **Hash Map for Prefix Sums**: A hash map is used to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum. This allows us to determine the length of any subarray whose sum is closest to zero by checking the difference between the current prefix sum and previously seen prefix sums.\n\n#### Strategies and Errors\n\n- **Initial Misunderstanding**: Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that the best segment would always have a sum of zero when the prefix sum is repeated. This led to incorrect results because the goal is to find the subarray with a sum closest to zero, not necessarily zero.\n\n- **Iterating Over Prefix Sums**: The correct approach involves iterating over all previously seen prefix sums to find the one that results in the smallest absolute subarray sum. This was initially overlooked.\n\n- **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution must handle cases where multiple subarrays have the same minimum absolute sum by choosing the longest one.\n\n#### Corrected Approach\n\nThe corrected approach involves:\n- Calculating the prefix sum as we iterate through the list.\n- Using a hash map to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum.\n- Iterating over all previously seen prefix sums to find the subarray with the smallest absolute sum.\n- Updating the best segment indices based on the smallest absolute sum and longest length.\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and correctly implementing the prefix sum technique with hash maps for efficient subarray sum calculations."

        "content": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem of finding the longest subarray with a sum closest to zero is a classic example of using prefix sums and efficient data structures to manage subarray calculations. Here's a breakdown of the insights gained from the official solution:\n\n1. **Prefix Sum and Binary Search**: The official solution uses a prefix sum array to keep track of cumulative sums. It leverages the `bisect` module to efficiently insert and find positions in a sorted list, which is crucial for maintaining the order of prefix sums and quickly finding the closest sums.\n\n2. **Handling Closest to Zero**: The solution checks for the closest sum to zero by comparing the current prefix sum with previously stored prefix sums. It uses a helper function `check` to update the best segment whenever a closer sum is found or when a longer segment with the same sum is found.\n\n3. **Efficient Updates**: By using binary search (`bisect_left`), the solution efficiently finds where to insert the current prefix sum in the sorted list, ensuring that the list remains sorted. This allows for quick calculation of differences between prefix sums, which represent subarray sums.\n\n4. **Edge Cases and Length Consideration**: The solution carefully handles edge cases by checking both the previous and next possible prefix sums to ensure that the longest segment is chosen when multiple segments have the same sum closest to zero.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Data Structures**: Using a sorted list with binary search (`bisect`) is a powerful technique for maintaining order and efficiently finding insertion points, which is crucial for problems involving prefix sums and subarray calculations.\n\n- **Prefix Sum Strategy**: The prefix sum approach is a versatile technique for transforming subarray sum problems into simpler difference problems, allowing for efficient calculations.\n\n- **Optimization**: The solution optimizes both time and space by maintaining only necessary information and using efficient data structures, which is essential for handling large input sizes within constraints.\n\nThis problem reinforces the importance of choosing the right data structures and algorithms to efficiently solve complex problems involving subarrays and cumulative calculations."
