## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Today, Chef has a fencing job at hand and has to fence up a surface covering N$N$ points. 
To minimize his work, he started looking for an algorithm that had him fence the least amount of length. 
He came up with the Convex Hull algorithm, but soon realized it gave him some random shape to fence. However, Chef likes rectangles and has a favourite number M$M$. 
Help him find the minimum perimeter he has to fence if he wants to fence a rectangle, with slope of one of the sides as M$M$, to cover all the points.

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains two integers N$N$ and M$M$, the number of points and the Chef's favourite Number.
- The next n lines contain two space separated integers X$X$ and Y$Y$, the coordinates of the point.

-----Output:-----
Print a single decimal number, denoting the perimeter of the rectangle. Answer will considered correct if it has absolute error less than 10âˆ’6$10^{-6}$.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a given set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to a given number \( M \). The task is to compute this perimeter with high precision.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope \( M \):**
   - A line with slope \( M \) can be represented as \( y = Mx + c \).
   - For a rectangle with one side having this slope, the opposite side will have the same slope, and the other two sides will have a slope of \(-1/M\) (perpendicular).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System:**
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope \( M \). This can be achieved using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: \( x' = x \cos(\theta) + y \sin(\theta) \)
     - New y-coordinate: \( y' = -x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta) \)
   - Here, \(\theta\) is the angle whose tangent is \( M \), i.e., \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).

3. **Finding the Bounding Rectangle:**
   - After transformation, find the minimum and maximum values of the new x and y coordinates.
   - The width of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
   - The height of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).

## Pseudocode

1. Read input values \( N \) and \( M \).
2. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum transformed x and y coordinates.
3. For each point:
   - Compute the angle \(\theta = \arctan(M)\).
   - Transform the point using the rotation formulas.
   - Update the minimum and maximum transformed x and y coordinates.
4. Calculate the width and height of the bounding rectangle.
5. Compute the perimeter as \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
6. Print the perimeter with high precision.

## Python Code

```python
import sys
import math

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = float(data[1])
    
    # Calculate the angle theta
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    # Initialize min and max for transformed coordinates
    min_x_prime = float('inf')
    max_x_prime = float('-inf')
    min_y_prime = float('inf')
    max_y_prime = float('-inf')
    
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = float(data[index])
        y = float(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Transform the coordinates
        x_prime = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta
        y_prime = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
        
        # Update min and max for x' and y'
        if x_prime < min_x_prime:
            min_x_prime = x_prime
        if x_prime > max_x_prime:
            max_x_prime = x_prime
        if y_prime < min_y_prime:
            min_y_prime = y_prime
        if y_prime > max_y_prime:
            max_y_prime = y_prime
    
    # Calculate width and height of the rectangle
    width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
    height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    
    # Print the result with high precision
    print(f"{perimeter:.12f}")

main()
```

This code reads the input, transforms the coordinates to align with the slope \( M \), calculates the bounding rectangle, and outputs the perimeter with high precision.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
        At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
        This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
        Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
        - Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
        - $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
        - $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$
        - $1 \leq k \leq 100$

        -----Sample Output:-----
        202

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        Initial score of students will be : $[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$
        after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 50, 50, 10, 10]$
        after solving question 2 scores will be: $[50, 100, 100, 20, 20]$
        after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 100, 700, 140, 20]$
        Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will $(50+100+700+140+20)/5 = 202$

    [Previous Critique]:
        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that the `main()` function, which contains the logic for reading input and producing output, is not being executed. In Python scripts, especially when using functions, it's crucial to ensure that the main logic is called when the script is executed.

        ### Steps to Identify the Problem

        1. **Check Function Execution**: Ensure that the `main()` function is called at the end of the script. Without this call, the script will define the functions but never execute them.
        2. **Input/Output Handling**: Verify that the input is being read correctly and that the output is being printed as expected.
        3. **Index Management**: Ensure that the index used to parse the input data is managed correctly to avoid any off-by-one errors or incorrect data parsing.

        ### Correction Steps

        1. **Call the `main()` Function**: Add a call to the `main()` function at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        2. **Verify Input Parsing**: Double-check the input parsing logic to ensure that it correctly handles the input format and constraints.

        ### Revised Solution

        ```python
        def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
            # Initialize scores for each student
            scores = [10] * N
    
            # Process each question
            for i, j, k in questions:
                for student in range(i, j + 1):
                    scores[student] *= k
    
            # Calculate the mean of the scores
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N  # Floor division
    
            return mean_score

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()

            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                M = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                questions = []
                for _ in range(M):
                    i = int(data[index]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
                    j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index
                    k = int(data[index + 2])
                    index += 3
                    questions.append((i, j, k))
        
                result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
                results.append(result)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        - **Function Call**: The `main()` function is now called when the script is executed, ensuring that the input is read and processed, and the output is printed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, split into a list of strings, and parsed using an index to handle multiple test cases efficiently.
        - **Output**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed at the end. This ensures that all outputs are correctly displayed.

    ### Summary of Problem-Solving Process

    The problem required maximizing the expression `A[d] - A[c] + A[b] - A[a]` with the constraint `d > c > b > a`. The challenge was to efficiently compute this maximum value given the constraints and the size of the input array.

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns

    - **Dynamic Programming**: The solution involved using dynamic programming to track the maximum possible values for each segment of the expression as we iterate through the array. This approach ensures that the constraints are respected and the expression is maximized.

    - **Iterative Backtracking**: By iterating through the array and maintaining running maximums for each part of the expression, we can efficiently compute the desired result without needing to check all possible combinations explicitly.

    #### Strategies and Fixes

    - **Initial Mistake**: The initial approach did not correctly handle the constraints and failed to track the necessary maximums for each segment of the expression. This led to incorrect results.

    - **Correct Approach**: By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using arrays to store intermediate maximum values (`max_a`, `max_b_minus_a`, `max_c_plus_b_minus_a`, `max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a`), the solution was able to correctly compute the maximum value of the expression.

    - **Input/Output Handling**: Ensuring that the input is read correctly from standard input and the result is printed to standard output was crucial for the solution to work in a competitive programming environment.

    #### Code Snippet

    Here's the final solution that correctly implements the logic:

    ```python
    def maximizeExpression(N, A):
        max_a = [0] * N
        max_b_minus_a = [0] * N
        max_c_plus_b_minus_a = [0] * N
        max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a = [0] * N

        max_a[0] = -A[0]
        for i in range(1, N):
            max_a[i] = max(max_a[i-1], -A[i])

        max_b_minus_a[1] = A[1] + max_a[0]
        for i in range(2, N):
            max_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_b_minus_a[i-1], A[i] + max_a[i-1])

        max_c_plus_b_minus_a[2] = -A[2] + max_b_minus_a[1]
        for i in range(3, N):
            max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1], -A[i] + max_b_minus_a[i-1])

        max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[3] = A[3] + max_c_plus_b_minus_a[2]
        for i in range(4, N):
            max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1], A[i] + max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1])

        return max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[N-1]

    # Read input from standard input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    N = int(data[0])
    A = list(map(int, data[1:]))

    result = maximizeExpression(N, A)
    print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down complex expressions into manageable parts and using dynamic programming to efficiently solve problems with constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of given points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to Chef's favorite number, M. The task is to find the minimum perimeter of such a rectangle that encloses all the points.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**: 
   - A line with slope M can be represented as `y = Mx + c`. For a rectangle, we need two parallel lines with this slope and two perpendicular lines.
   - The perpendicular slope to M is `-1/M` (assuming M is not zero).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System**:
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope M. This can be done using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: `x' = x + My`
     - New y-coordinate: `y' = y - (1/M)x` (if M is not zero)

3. **Finding the Bounding Box**:
   - After transforming the points, find the minimum and maximum values of the new x and y coordinates.
   - These will define the smallest rectangle in the transformed space.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter**:
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is `2 * (width + height)`, where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If M is zero, the rectangle sides are aligned with the original axes, and the problem simplifies to finding the axis-aligned bounding box.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points):
    if M == 0:
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        max_x = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        min_y = min(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        max_y = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        width = max_x - min_x
        height = max_y - min_y
    else:
        min_x_prime = float('inf')
        max_x_prime = float('-inf')
        min_y_prime = float('inf')
        max_y_prime = float('-inf')
        
        for (x, y) in points:
            x_prime = x + M * y
            y_prime = y - (1/M) * x
            min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
            max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
            min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
            max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
        
        width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
        height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    return perimeter
```

        max_y = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        width = max_x - min_x
        height = max_y - min_y

This solution reads input from standard input, processes the points, and calculates the minimum perimeter of the rectangle that can enclose all points with one side having a slope of M. The result is printed with a precision that ensures the absolute error is less than \(10^{-6}\).

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Today, Chef has a fencing job at hand and has to fence up a surface covering N$N$ points. 
To minimize his work, he started looking for an algorithm that had him fence the least amount of length. 
He came up with the Convex Hull algorithm, but soon realized it gave him some random shape to fence. However, Chef likes rectangles and has a favourite number M$M$. 
Help him find the minimum perimeter he has to fence if he wants to fence a rectangle, with slope of one of the sides as M$M$, to cover all the points.

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains two integers N$N$ and M$M$, the number of points and the Chef's favourite Number.
- The next n lines contain two space separated integers X$X$ and Y$Y$, the coordinates of the point.

-----Output:-----

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of given points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to Chef's favorite number, M. The task is to find the minimum perimeter of such a rectangle that encloses all the points.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**: 
   - A line with slope M can be represented as `y = Mx + c`. For a rectangle, we need two parallel lines with this slope and two perpendicular lines.
   - The perpendicular slope to M is `-1/M` (assuming M is not zero).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System**:
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope M. This can be done using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: `x' = x + My`
     - New y-coordinate: `y' = y - (1/M)x` (if M is not zero)

3. **Finding the Bounding Box**:
   - After transforming the points, find the minimum and maximum values of the new x and y coordinates.
   - These will define the smallest rectangle in the transformed space.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter**:
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is `2 * (width + height)`, where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If M is zero, the rectangle sides are aligned with the original axes, and the problem simplifies to finding the axis-aligned bounding box.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points):
    if M == 0:
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        max_x = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        min_y = min(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        max_y = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        width = max_x - min_x
        height = max_y - min_y
    else:
        min_x_prime = float('inf')
        max_x_prime = float('-inf')
        min_y_prime = float('inf')
        max_y_prime = float('-inf')
        
        for (x, y) in points:
            x_prime = x + M * y
            y_prime = y - (1/M) * x
            min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
            max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
            min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
            max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
        
        width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
        height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    return perimeter
```

            y_prime = y - (1/M) * x
            min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)

        width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
        height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime

    result = calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points)
    print(f"{result:.12f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":

This solution reads input from standard input, processes the points, and calculates the minimum perimeter of the rectangle that can enclose all points with one side having a slope of M. The result is printed with a precision that ensures the absolute error is less than \(10^{-6}\).

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the initial solution is likely due to the incorrect transformation of the coordinate system and the calculation of the bounding box. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Transformation of Coordinates**:
   - The transformation used in the initial solution was incorrect. The transformation should align the coordinate system such that one axis is parallel to the line with slope M. This involves a rotation of the coordinate system.

2. **Bounding Box Calculation**:
   - After transforming the coordinates, the bounding box should be calculated in the transformed space. The width and height of this bounding box should then be used to calculate the perimeter.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter should be calculated using the correct width and height derived from the transformed coordinates.

### Correct Approach

1. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - Use a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The angle of rotation, Î¸, can be derived from the slope M using the arctangent function: Î¸ = arctan(M).
   - The transformation for a point (x, y) is:
     - x' = x * cos(Î¸) + y * sin(Î¸)
     - y' = -x * sin(Î¸) + y * cos(Î¸)

2. **Bounding Box in Transformed Space**:
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum x' and y' values in the transformed space to determine the bounding box.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter is 2 * (width + height), where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points):
    if M == 0:
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        max_x = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        min_y = min(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        max_y = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        width = max_x - min_x
        height = max_y - min_y
    else:
        theta = atan(M)
        cos_theta = cos(theta)
        sin_theta = sin(theta)
        
        min_x_prime = float('inf')
        max_x_prime = float('-inf')
        min_y_prime = float('inf')
        max_y_prime = float('-inf')
        
        for (x, y) in points:
            x_prime = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta
            y_prime = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
            min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
            max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
            min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
            max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
        
        width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
        height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    return perimeter
```

### Revised Python Solution

```python

import math

def calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points):
    if M == 0:
        # Axis-aligned bounding box
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]

        cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
        sin_theta = math.sin(theta)

        width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
        height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    return perimeter

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = int(data[1])
    points = []
    
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        points.append((x, y))
        index += 2
    
    result = calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points)
    print(f"{result:.12f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":

This revised solution correctly transforms the coordinates using a rotation matrix and calculates the bounding box in the transformed space, ensuring the correct perimeter is computed.

Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of given points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to Chef's favorite number, M. The task is to find the minimum perimeter of such a rectangle that encloses all the points.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**: 
   - A line with slope M can be represented as `y = Mx + c`. For a rectangle, we need two parallel lines with this slope and two perpendicular lines.
   - The perpendicular slope to M is `-1/M` (assuming M is not zero).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System**:
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope M. This can be done using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: `x' = x + My`
     - New y-coordinate: `y' = y - (1/M)x` (if M is not zero)

3. **Finding the Bounding Box**:
   - After transforming the points, find the minimum and maximum values of the new x and y coordinates.
   - These will define the smallest rectangle in the transformed space.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter**:
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is `2 * (width + height)`, where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If M is zero, the rectangle sides are aligned with the original axes, and the problem simplifies to finding the axis-aligned bounding box.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points):
    if M == 0:
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        max_x = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        min_y = min(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        max_y = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        width = max_x - min_x
        height = max_y - min_y

        min_y_prime = float('inf')
        max_y_prime = float('-inf')
        
        for (x, y) in points:
            x_prime = x + M * y
            y_prime = y - (1/M) * x
            min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
            max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
            min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
            max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
        
        width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
        height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    return perimeter
```

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the initial solution is likely due to the incorrect transformation of the coordinate system and the calculation of the bounding box. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Transformation of Coordinates**:
   - The transformation used in the initial solution was incorrect. The transformation should align the coordinate system such that one axis is parallel to the line with slope M. This involves a rotation of the coordinate system.

2. **Bounding Box Calculation**:
   - After transforming the coordinates, the bounding box should be calculated in the transformed space. The width and height of this bounding box should then be used to calculate the perimeter.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter should be calculated using the correct width and height derived from the transformed coordinates.

### Correct Approach

1. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - Use a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The angle of rotation, Î¸, can be derived from the slope M using the arctangent function: Î¸ = arctan(M).
   - The transformation for a point (x, y) is:
     - x' = x * cos(Î¸) + y * sin(Î¸)
     - y' = -x * sin(Î¸) + y * cos(Î¸)

2. **Bounding Box in Transformed Space**:
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum x' and y' values in the transformed space to determine the bounding box.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter is 2 * (width + height), where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points):
    if M == 0:
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        max_x = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        min_y = min(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        max_y = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        width = max_x - min_x
        height = max_y - min_y
    else:
        theta = atan(M)
        cos_theta = cos(theta)
        sin_theta = sin(theta)
        
        min_x_prime = float('inf')
        max_x_prime = float('-inf')
        min_y_prime = float('inf')
        max_y_prime = float('-inf')
        
        for (x, y) in points:
            x_prime = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta
            y_prime = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
            min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
            max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
            min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
            max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
        
        width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
        height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    return perimeter

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

    ### Summary of Problem-Solving Process

    The problem required maximizing the expression `A[d] - A[c] + A[b] - A[a]` with the constraint `d > c > b > a`. The challenge was to efficiently compute this maximum value given the constraints and the size of the input array.

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns

    - **Dynamic Programming**: The solution involved using dynamic programming to track the maximum possible values for each segment of the expression as we iterate through the array. This approach ensures that the constraints are respected and the expression is maximized.

    - **Iterative Backtracking**: By iterating through the array and maintaining running maximums for each part of the expression, we can efficiently compute the desired result without needing to check all possible combinations explicitly.

    #### Strategies and Fixes

    - **Initial Mistake**: The initial approach did not correctly handle the constraints and failed to track the necessary maximums for each segment of the expression. This led to incorrect results.

    - **Correct Approach**: By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using arrays to store intermediate maximum values (`max_a`, `max_b_minus_a`, `max_c_plus_b_minus_a`, `max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a`), the solution was able to correctly compute the maximum value of the expression.

    - **Input/Output Handling**: Ensuring that the input is read correctly from standard input and the result is printed to standard output was crucial for the solution to work in a competitive programming environment.

    #### Code Snippet

    Here's the final solution that correctly implements the logic:

    ```python
    def maximizeExpression(N, A):
        max_a = [0] * N
        max_b_minus_a = [0] * N
        max_c_plus_b_minus_a = [0] * N
        max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a = [0] * N

        max_a[0] = -A[0]
        for i in range(1, N):
            max_a[i] = max(max_a[i-1], -A[i])

        max_b_minus_a[1] = A[1] + max_a[0]
        for i in range(2, N):
            max_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_b_minus_a[i-1], A[i] + max_a[i-1])

        max_c_plus_b_minus_a[2] = -A[2] + max_b_minus_a[1]
        for i in range(3, N):
            max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1], -A[i] + max_b_minus_a[i-1])

        max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[3] = A[3] + max_c_plus_b_minus_a[2]
        for i in range(4, N):
            max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[i] = max(max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1], A[i] + max_c_plus_b_minus_a[i-1])

        return max_d_minus_c_plus_b_minus_a[N-1]

    # Read input from standard input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    N = int(data[0])
    A = list(map(int, data[1:]))

    result = maximizeExpression(N, A)
    print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down complex expressions into manageable parts and using dynamic programming to efficiently solve problems with constraints.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

### Explanation

- **Coordinate Transformation**: The code uses a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The angle of rotation, Î¸, is calculated using `atan(M)`, which aligns the x-axis with the slope M.
- **Bounding Box Calculation**: After transforming the points, the code calculates the minimum and maximum x' and y' values to determine the bounding box in the transformed space.
- **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter is calculated as `2 * (width + height)`, where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.
- **Handling M = 0**: If M is zero, the rectangle is axis-aligned, and the bounding box is calculated directly from the original coordinates.

This solution should correctly compute the minimum perimeter of the rectangle that encloses all points with one side having a slope of M.

### Explanation

- **Coordinate Transformation**: The code uses a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The angle of rotation, Î¸, is calculated using `atan(M)`, which aligns the x-axis with the slope M.
- **Bounding Box Calculation**: After transforming the points, the code calculates the minimum and maximum x' and y' values to determine the bounding box in the transformed space.
- **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter is calculated as `2 * (width + height)`, where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.
- **Handling M = 0**: If M is zero, the rectangle is axis-aligned, and the bounding box is calculated directly from the original coordinates.

This solution should correctly compute the minimum perimeter of the rectangle that encloses all points with one side having a slope of M.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of given points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to Chef's favorite number, M. The task is to find the minimum perimeter of such a rectangle that encloses all the points.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**: 
   - A line with slope M can be represented as `y = Mx + c`. For a rectangle, we need two parallel lines with this slope and two perpendicular lines.
   - The perpendicular slope to M is `-1/M` (assuming M is not zero).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System**:
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope M. This can be done using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: `x' = x + My`
     - New y-coordinate: `y' = y - (1/M)x` (if M is not zero)

3. **Finding the Bounding Box**:
   - After transforming the points, find the minimum and maximum values of the new x and y coordinates.
   - These will define the smallest rectangle in the transformed space.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter**:
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is `2 * (width + height)`, where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If M is zero, the rectangle sides are aligned with the original axes, and the problem simplifies to finding the axis-aligned bounding box.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points):
    if M == 0:
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        max_x = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        min_y = min(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        max_y = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        width = max_x - min_x
        height = max_y - min_y
    else:
        min_x_prime = float('inf')
        max_x_prime = float('-inf')
        min_y_prime = float('inf')
        max_y_prime = float('-inf')
        
        for (x, y) in points:
            x_prime = x + M * y
            y_prime = y - (1/M) * x
            min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
            max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
            min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
            max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
        
        width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
        height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    return perimeter
```

### Final Python Solution

def calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points):
    if M == 0:
        # Axis-aligned bounding box

        width = max_x - min_x
        height = max_y - min_y

This solution reads input from standard input, processes the points, and calculates the minimum perimeter of the rectangle that can enclose all points with one side having a slope of M. The result is printed with a precision that ensures the absolute error is less than \(10^{-6}\).

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the initial solution is likely due to the incorrect transformation of the coordinate system and the calculation of the bounding box. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Transformation of Coordinates**:
   - The transformation used in the initial solution was incorrect. The transformation should align the coordinate system such that one axis is parallel to the line with slope M. This involves a rotation of the coordinate system.

2. **Bounding Box Calculation**:
   - After transforming the coordinates, the bounding box should be calculated in the transformed space. The width and height of this bounding box should then be used to calculate the perimeter.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter should be calculated using the correct width and height derived from the transformed coordinates.

### Correct Approach

1. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - Use a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The angle of rotation, Î¸, can be derived from the slope M using the arctangent function: Î¸ = arctan(M).
   - The transformation for a point (x, y) is:
     - x' = x * cos(Î¸) + y * sin(Î¸)
     - y' = -x * sin(Î¸) + y * cos(Î¸)

2. **Bounding Box in Transformed Space**:
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum x' and y' values in the transformed space to determine the bounding box.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter is 2 * (width + height), where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.

### Revised Pseudocode

- **Coordinate Transformation**: The code uses a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The angle of rotation, Î¸, is calculated using `atan(M)`, which aligns the x-axis with the slope M.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that encloses a set of points on a 2D plane, with one side having a specified slope M. The core concept involved transforming the coordinate system to align with the slope M, which required understanding and applying a rotation transformation.

### Key Concepts and Patterns:
- **Coordinate Transformation**: The problem required transforming the coordinate system using a rotation matrix. This was necessary to align one axis with the slope M, allowing for the calculation of a bounding box in the transformed space.
- **Bounding Box Calculation**: After transforming the coordinates, the minimum and maximum values in the new coordinate system were used to determine the bounding box, which directly influenced the perimeter calculation.

### Strategies and Fixes:
- **Initial Mistake**: The initial approach incorrectly transformed the coordinates, leading to incorrect bounding box calculations. The transformation equations were not properly derived from the slope M.
- **Correct Approach**: By using the angle Î¸ derived from `atan(M)`, the correct rotation matrix was applied, allowing for accurate transformation and bounding box determination.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: Special handling was required for the case when M = 0, where the rectangle is axis-aligned, simplifying the bounding box calculation.

### Code Snippet:
```python
theta = math.atan(M)
cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
sin_theta = math.sin(theta)

for (x, y) in points:
    x_prime = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta
    y_prime = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
    # Update min/max x' and y' for bounding box
```

This experience reinforced the importance of correctly applying geometric transformations and understanding their implications on problem constraints. The solution also highlighted the need to handle special cases separately to ensure accuracy.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of given points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides with a slope equal to Chef's favorite number, M. The task is to find the minimum perimeter of such a rectangle that encloses all the points.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Rectangle with Slope M**: 
   - A line with slope M can be represented as `y = Mx + c`. For a rectangle, we need two parallel lines with this slope and two perpendicular lines.
   - The perpendicular slope to M is `-1/M` (assuming M is not zero).

2. **Transforming the Coordinate System**:
   - Rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis aligns with the slope M. This can be done using a transformation:
     - New x-coordinate: `x' = x + My`
     - New y-coordinate: `y' = y - (1/M)x` (if M is not zero)

3. **Finding the Bounding Box**:
   - After transforming the points, find the minimum and maximum values of the new x and y coordinates.
   - These will define the smallest rectangle in the transformed space.

4. **Calculating the Perimeter**:
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is `2 * (width + height)`, where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If M is zero, the rectangle sides are aligned with the original axes, and the problem simplifies to finding the axis-aligned bounding box.

### Pseudocode

```
function calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points):
    if M == 0:
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        max_x = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        min_y = min(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        max_y = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        width = max_x - min_x
        height = max_y - min_y
    else:
        min_x_prime = float('inf')
        max_x_prime = float('-inf')
        min_y_prime = float('inf')
        max_y_prime = float('-inf')
        
        for (x, y) in points:
            x_prime = x + M * y
            y_prime = y - (1/M) * x
            min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
            max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
            min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
            max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
        
        width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
        height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    return perimeter
```

def calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points):
    if M == 0:
        # Axis-aligned bounding box
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]

        width = max_x - min_x
        height = max_y - min_y

            x_prime = x + M * y
            y_prime = y - (1/M) * x
            min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
            max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
            min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)
            max_y_prime = max(max_y_prime, y_prime)
        
        width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
        height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    return perimeter

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    M = int(data[1])

    result = calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points)
    print(f"{result:.12f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes the points, and calculates the minimum perimeter of the rectangle that can enclose all points with one side having a slope of M. The result is printed with a precision that ensures the absolute error is less than \(10^{-6}\).

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the initial solution is likely due to the incorrect transformation of the coordinate system and the calculation of the bounding box. Let's break down the problem and identify where the solution went wrong:

1. **Transformation of Coordinates**:
   - The transformation used in the initial solution was incorrect. The transformation should align the coordinate system such that one axis is parallel to the line with slope M. This involves a rotation of the coordinate system.

2. **Bounding Box Calculation**:
   - After transforming the coordinates, the bounding box should be calculated in the transformed space. The width and height of this bounding box should then be used to calculate the perimeter.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter should be calculated using the correct width and height derived from the transformed coordinates.

### Correct Approach

1. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - Use a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The angle of rotation, Î¸, can be derived from the slope M using the arctangent function: Î¸ = arctan(M).
   - The transformation for a point (x, y) is:
     - x' = x * cos(Î¸) + y * sin(Î¸)
     - y' = -x * sin(Î¸) + y * cos(Î¸)

2. **Bounding Box in Transformed Space**:
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum x' and y' values in the transformed space to determine the bounding box.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter is 2 * (width + height), where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function calculate_minimum_perimeter(N, M, points):
    if M == 0:
        min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        max_x = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        min_y = min(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        max_y = max(points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        width = max_x - min_x
        height = max_y - min_y
    else:
        theta = atan(M)
        cos_theta = cos(theta)
        sin_theta = sin(theta)
        
        min_x_prime = float('inf')
        max_x_prime = float('-inf')
        min_y_prime = float('inf')
        max_y_prime = float('-inf')

            x_prime = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta
            y_prime = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
            min_x_prime = min(min_x_prime, x_prime)
            max_x_prime = max(max_x_prime, x_prime)
            min_y_prime = min(min_y_prime, y_prime)

        width = max_x_prime - min_x_prime
        height = max_y_prime - min_y_prime
    
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    return perimeter

### Explanation

- **Coordinate Transformation**: The code uses a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates. The angle of rotation, Î¸, is calculated using `atan(M)`, which aligns the x-axis with the slope M.
- **Bounding Box Calculation**: After transforming the points, the code calculates the minimum and maximum x' and y' values to determine the bounding box in the transformed space.
- **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter is calculated as `2 * (width + height)`, where width and height are the differences between the max and min x' and y' values, respectively.
- **Handling M = 0**: If M is zero, the rectangle is axis-aligned, and the bounding box is calculated directly from the original coordinates.

This solution should correctly compute the minimum perimeter of the rectangle that encloses all points with one side having a slope of M.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem of finding the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that encloses a set of points with one side having a specific slope was insightful in terms of understanding coordinate transformations and bounding box calculations.

#### Key Insights:

1. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - The official solution uses a transformation based on trigonometric identities to align the coordinate system with the desired slope. This involves calculating the cosine and sine of the angle derived from the slope M using the formula:
     - `cos(Î¸) = 1 / sqrt(1 + M^2)`
     - `sin(Î¸) = M / sqrt(1 + M^2)`
   - This transformation effectively rotates the coordinate system, allowing for easy calculation of the bounding box in the transformed space.

2. **Bounding Box Calculation**:
   - After transforming the points, the solution calculates the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates to determine the bounding box. This is a straightforward approach to find the smallest rectangle that can enclose all points.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The perimeter is calculated using the width and height of the bounding box in the transformed space. This is done by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum transformed coordinates.

#### Why the Official Solution Works:

- The official solution efficiently uses trigonometric transformations to align the coordinate system with the slope M, which simplifies the problem of finding the bounding box.
- By using the properties of rotation matrices, the solution avoids the complexities of directly dealing with slopes and instead focuses on transformed coordinates, which are easier to handle.
- The use of trigonometric functions ensures that the transformation is accurate and handles all possible values of M, including edge cases.

#### Lessons Learned:

- **Trigonometric Transformations**: Understanding how to use trigonometric functions to rotate coordinate systems can be a powerful tool in geometry-related problems.
- **Bounding Box in Transformed Space**: Calculating bounding boxes in a transformed space can simplify problems that involve specific orientations or slopes.
- **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in both time and space, making it suitable for large input sizes, which is crucial given the constraints of the problem.

This problem reinforced the importance of geometric transformations and provided a practical application of trigonometry in computational geometry.

The main function is `main`.
INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] The function reads input data from standard input, which includes the number of points, a slope value, and the coordinates of the points. It parses this input to extract the number of points (N), the slope (M), and the list of points. It then calls another function to calculate the minimum perimeter of a bounding box that can enclose all the given points, considering the slope for potential rotation of the coordinate system. Finally, it prints the calculated perimeter with a precision of 12 decimal places.

[Problem]
    Today, Chef has a fencing job at hand and has to fence up a surface covering N$N$ points. 
    To minimize his work, he started looking for an algorithm that had him fence the least amount of length. 
    He came up with the Convex Hull algorithm, but soon realized it gave him some random shape to fence. However, Chef likes rectangles and has a favourite number M$M$. 
    Help him find the minimum perimeter he has to fence if he wants to fence a rectangle, with slope of one of the sides as M$M$, to cover all the points.

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line contains two integers N$N$ and M$M$, the number of points and the Chef's favourite Number.
    - The next n lines contain two space separated integers X$X$ and Y$Y$, the coordinates of the point.

    -----Output:-----
    Print a single decimal number, denoting the perimeter of the rectangle. Answer will considered correct if it has absolute error less than 10âˆ’6$10^{-6}$.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 2â‰¤Nâ‰¤1000000$2 \leq N \leq 1000000$
    - âˆ’1000â‰¤Mâ‰¤1000$-1000 \leq M \leq 1000$
    - âˆ’1000000â‰¤Xâ‰¤1000000$-1000000 \leq X \leq 1000000$
    - âˆ’1000000â‰¤Yâ‰¤1000000$-1000000 \leq Y \leq 1000000$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    4 1
    0 1
    0 -1
    1 0
    -1 0

    -----Sample Output:-----
    5.656854249492380

    -----Note:-----
    - As the input size is large, it is recommended to use Fast IO.
