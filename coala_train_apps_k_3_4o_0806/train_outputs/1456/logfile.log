## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The XOR pair representation (XPR) of a positive integer $N$ is defined as a pair of integers $(A, B)$ such that:

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to solve a problem involving XOR pair representation (XPR) of a number \( N \). For a given number \( N \), we need to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) such that:
- \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \)
- \( A \oplus B = N \)
- \( A \) is the smallest possible value that satisfies the above conditions.

If no such pair exists, \( A = B = -1 \). Otherwise, the function \( F(N) \) returns the value of \( B \) in the XPR of \( N \).

Given two integers \( L \) and \( R \), we need to compute the sum \( G(L, R) = \sum_{i=L}^R F(i) \).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR Properties**: 
   - XOR operation has a property that \( A \oplus A = 0 \) and \( A \oplus 0 = A \).
   - For \( A \oplus B = N \), we can derive \( B = A \oplus N \).

2. **Finding Valid Pairs**:
   - For each \( N \), iterate over possible values of \( A \) from 1 to \( N \).
   - Calculate \( B = A \oplus N \).
   - Check if \( A \leq B \leq N \). If true, this is a valid pair.

3. **Compute \( F(N) \)**:
   - For each \( N \), find the smallest \( A \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \) and \( 1 \leq A \leq B \leq N \).
   - If no such \( A \) exists, \( F(N) = -1 \).

4. **Compute \( G(L, R) \)**:
   - For each test case, compute the sum of \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

## Pseudocode

```
function F(N):
    for A from 1 to N:
        B = A XOR N
        if A <= B <= N:
            return B
    return -1

function G(L, R):
    sum = 0
    for i from L to R:
        sum += F(i)
    return sum

read T
for each test case:
    read L, R
    print G(L, R)
```

## Python Solution

```python
def F(N):
    # Iterate over possible values of A
    for A in range(1, N + 1):
        B = A ^ N  # Calculate B using XOR
        # Check if the pair (A, B) is valid
        if A <= B <= N:
            return B
    return -1  # If no valid pair is found

def G(L, R):
    total_sum = 0
    # Calculate the sum of F(i) for all i from L to R
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        total_sum += F(i)
    return total_sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(G(L, R))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# The main function will be called when the script is executed
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result for each one. The function `F(N)` finds the value of \( B \) for each \( N \), and `G(L, R)` computes the sum of these values over the range \([L, R]\).

    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        ### Analysis of the Current Solution
        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input and `sys.stdout.write` to output results. This is appropriate for competitive programming but can be tricky if not handled correctly. The function `find_permutation` is defined but not called, which means the code doesn't execute.

        2. **Logic for Permutation Construction**:
           - The logic attempts to start with the maximum possible sum by using a descending order permutation.
           - It then tries to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K by swapping adjacent elements.

        3. **Mistakes and Misunderstandings**:
           - The function `find_permutation` is defined but never called, so no logic is executed.
           - The permutation adjustment logic might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the sum needs to be reduced by more than one at a time.
           - The permutation construction logic might not correctly handle cases where the desired sum K is exactly the maximum possible sum.

        ### Steps to Correct the Solution
        1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: Make sure the function is executed by calling it after its definition.
        2. **Refine the Permutation Adjustment Logic**:
           - Ensure that the logic correctly reduces the sum to K by considering larger swaps or more efficient adjustments.
           - Handle edge cases where the desired sum is exactly the maximum possible sum.

        3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test the solution with various edge cases to ensure correctness.

        ### Revised Solution
        Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

        ```python
        def find_permutation():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)
                min_possible = N - 1
                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        
                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    # Start with the permutation in descending order
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                    current_sum = max_possible
            
                    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
                    for i in range(N - 1):
                        if current_sum == K:
                            break
                        # Calculate the current max of the pair
                        current_max = max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1])
                        # Calculate the new max if we swap
                        new_max = max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i + 2] if i + 2 < N else 0)
                        # Calculate the difference
                        diff = current_max - new_max
                        # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap
                        if current_sum - diff >= K:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_sum -= diff
            
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        # Call the function to execute
        find_permutation()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes
        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure execution.
        - **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.
        - **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called and the logic is correctly implemented to handle the permutation construction and adjustment. Here's the corrected code:

        ```python
        def find_permutation():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read

            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)
                min_possible = N - 1
                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        
                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:

                        # Calculate the new max if we swap
                        new_max = max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i + 2] if i + 2 < N else 0)
                        # Calculate the difference
                        diff = current_max - new_max
                        # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap
                        if current_sum - diff >= K:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_sum -= diff
            
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        # Call the function to execute
        find_permutation()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes
        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure execution.
        - **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.
        - **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.

        This code should now correctly read from standard input, process each test case, and print the expected output.

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 40
        - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file â‰¤ 106
        - 0 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 2 * 1010

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        3
        4 12
        2 2
        5 14

        Output:
        -1
        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

        ### Problem Restatement
        We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and need to find a permutation such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

        ### Conceptual Solution
        1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:
           \[
           f(P) = \max(p_1, p_2) + \max(p_2, p_3) + \ldots + \max(p_{N-1}, p_N)
           \]

        2. **Constraints and Observations**:
           - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.
           - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \(\frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\).

        3. **Approach**:
           - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
           - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

        4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
           - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
           - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

        ### Pseudocode
        ```
        function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
            for each (N, K) in test_cases:
                if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:
                    output -1
                else:
                    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
                    i = 0
                    while current_sum > K:
                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i+1]:
                            swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
                            current_sum -= 1
                        i += 1
                    output permutation
        ```

        ### Final Python Code
        ```python
        def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                if K < N - 1 or K > (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
                    i = 0
                    while current_sum > K:
                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_sum -= 1
                        i += 1
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        ```

        ### Explanation
        - We start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
        - We then iteratively swap adjacent elements to reduce the sum until it matches K.
        - This approach ensures that we efficiently find a permutation that satisfies the condition or determine that it's impossible.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

We need to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) for a given positive integer \( N \) such that:
- \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \)
- \( A \oplus B = N \)
- \( A \) is the smallest possible value that satisfies the above conditions.

If no such pair exists, \( A = B = -1 \). The function \( F(N) \) is defined as the value of \( B \) in the pair \( (A, B) \). We then define another function \( G(L, R) \) which is the sum of \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

Given multiple test cases, each with a range \( [L, R] \), we need to compute \( G(L, R) \) for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR**: The XOR operation has a property that if \( A \oplus B = N \), then \( B = A \oplus N \). This means for a given \( A \), we can compute \( B \) directly.

2. **Finding the Pair**:
   - Iterate over possible values of \( A \) from 1 to \( N \).
   - Compute \( B = A \oplus N \).
   - Check if \( A \leq B \leq N \). If true, this is a valid pair.
   - The first valid pair found will have the smallest \( A \).

3. **Handling No Valid Pair**: If no valid pair is found, return \( A = B = -1 \).

4. **Compute \( F(N) \)**: For each \( N \), find the value of \( B \) in the valid pair or return -1 if no pair exists.

5. **Compute \( G(L, R) \)**: For each test case, sum up \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

### Pseudocode

```
function F(N):
    for A from 1 to N:
        B = A XOR N
        if A <= B <= N:

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) for a given positive integer \( N \) such that:
- \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \)
- \( A \oplus B = N \)
- \( A \) is the smallest possible value that satisfies the above conditions.

If no such pair exists, \( A = B = -1 \). The function \( F(N) \) is defined as the value of \( B \) in the pair \( (A, B) \). We then define another function \( G(L, R) \) which is the sum of \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

Given multiple test cases, each with a range \( [L, R] \), we need to compute \( G(L, R) \) for each test case.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR**: The XOR operation has a property that if \( A \oplus B = N \), then \( B = A \oplus N \). This means for a given \( A \), we can compute \( B \) directly.

2. **Finding the Pair**:
   - Iterate over possible values of \( A \) from 1 to \( N \).
   - Compute \( B = A \oplus N \).
   - Check if \( A \leq B \leq N \). If true, this is a valid pair.
   - The first valid pair found will have the smallest \( A \).

3. **Handling No Valid Pair**: If no valid pair is found, return \( A = B = -1 \).

4. **Compute \( F(N) \)**: For each \( N \), find the value of \( B \) in the valid pair or return -1 if no pair exists.

5. **Compute \( G(L, R) \)**: For each test case, sum up \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

### Pseudocode

```
function F(N):
    for A from 1 to N:
        B = A XOR N
        if A <= B <= N:
            return B
    return -1

function G(L, R):
    sum = 0
    for i from L to R:
        sum += F(i)
    return sum

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read L, R
        result = G(L, R)
        print result
```

### Final Python Code

```python
def F(N):
    for A in range(1, N + 1):
        B = A ^ N
        if A <= B <= N:
            return B
    return -1

def G(L, R):
    total = 0
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        total += F(i)
    return total

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        result = G(L, R)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **F(N)**: This function iterates over possible values of \( A \) and computes \( B \) using the XOR operation. It checks if the pair \( (A, B) \) is valid and returns \( B \) if it is.
- **G(L, R)**: This function computes the sum of \( F(i) \) for all \( i \) in the range \( [L, R] \).
- **main()**: This function handles input and output, reading multiple test cases and computing results for each.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept revolves around understanding the properties of the XOR operation and how it can be used to find a specific pair of integers \((A, B)\) for a given integer \(N\). The task was to compute a function \(G(L, R)\) which sums up the values of \(B\) from the XOR pair representation of each integer in the range \([L, R]\).

Key insights included:
- The XOR operation's property that if \(A \oplus B = N\), then \(B = A \oplus N\). This allows us to compute \(B\) directly for a given \(A\).
- The need to iterate over possible values of \(A\) to find the smallest valid pair \((A, B)\) where \(1 \le A \le B \le N\).
- Efficiently handling multiple test cases by reading input in bulk and processing each range \([L, R]\) to compute the sum of \(F(i)\).

The solution involved defining two functions: \(F(N)\) to find the value of \(B\) for each \(N\), and \(G(L, R)\) to compute the sum over a range. The main function handled input/output efficiently, which is crucial given the constraints.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding bitwise operations and their properties, as well as the need for efficient input/output handling in competitive programming scenarios.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:

    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] The problem of finding the XOR pair representation (XPR) and computing the function \( G(L, R) \) was approached differently in the official solution compared to my initial solution. Here are the key insights and differences:

### Key Insights from the Official Solution

1. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The official solution leverages a mathematical approach to compute the sum of \( F(i) \) for a range efficiently. It uses properties of numbers and bit manipulation to avoid iterating over each number in the range explicitly.

2. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - The function `GLR(x)` computes the sum of \( F(i) \) from 1 to \( x \) using a combination of arithmetic series and bit manipulation. This avoids the need to compute \( F(i) \) for each individual \( i \), which is crucial for handling large ranges efficiently.

3. **Use of Arithmetic Series**:
   - The solution uses the formula for the sum of the first \( x \) natural numbers, \( \frac{x(x+1)}{2} \), to compute the total sum of numbers up to \( x \).

4. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - The solution uses bit manipulation to determine how many numbers contribute to the sum \( A \) and subsequently to \( B \). This is done by iterating over powers of 2 and counting how many numbers fall into each power range.

5. **Logarithmic Adjustment**:
   - The final adjustment using logarithms accounts for the number of bits required to represent the numbers, ensuring the correct calculation of \( F(i) \).

### Reflection on My Approach

- **Iterative Approach**:
  - My initial approach was straightforward but inefficient for large ranges, as it involved iterating over each number and checking conditions for each \( A \) and \( B \). This would not scale well for the upper limits of the problem constraints.

- **Learning**:
  - The official solution demonstrates the power of mathematical insights and bit manipulation in optimizing problems that initially seem to require brute force. It highlights the importance of understanding the underlying properties of operations like XOR and leveraging them to simplify calculations.

In summary, the official solution provides a more efficient and scalable approach to the problem by using mathematical properties and bit manipulation, which is a valuable lesson in optimizing algorithms for large input sizes.

    "scenarios": "This knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to compute a specific function over a range of integers, particularly when the function involves bitwise operations like XOR. The problem involves finding pairs of integers that satisfy certain conditions, which is a common task in combinatorics and number theory. The solution demonstrates how to efficiently iterate over a range and apply a function to each element, which is a useful pattern in competitive programming and algorithm design. Additionally, understanding how to handle large input sizes and constraints is crucial for optimizing performance in real-world applications.",
