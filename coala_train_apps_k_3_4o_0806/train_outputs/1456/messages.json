For a given number \\( N \\), we need to find a pair of integers \\( (A, B) \\) such that:\n- \\( 1 \\le A \\le B \\le N \\)\n- \\( A \\oplus B = N \\)\n- \\( A \\) is the smallest possible value that satisfies the above conditions.\n\nIf no such pair exists, \\( A = B = -1 \\). Otherwise, the function \\( F(N) \\) returns the value of \\( B \\) in the XPR of \\( N \\).\n\nGiven two integers \\( L \\) and \\( R \\), we need to compute the sum \\( G(L, R) = \\sum_{i=L}^R F(i) \\).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding XOR Properties**: \n   - XOR operation has a property that \\( A \\oplus A = 0 \\) and \\( A \\oplus 0 = A \\).\n   - For \\( A \\oplus B = N \\), we can derive \\( B = A \\oplus N \\).\n\n2. **Finding Valid Pairs**:\n   - For each \\( N \\), iterate over possible values of \\( A \\) from 1 to \\( N \\).\n   - Calculate \\( B = A \\oplus N \\).\n   - Check if \\( A \\leq B \\leq N \\). If true, this is a valid pair.\n\n3. **Compute \\( F(N) \\)**:\n   - For each \\( N \\), find the smallest \\( A \\) such that \\( A \\oplus B = N \\) and \\( 1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq N \\).\n   - If no such \\( A \\) exists, \\( F(N) = -1 \\).\n\n4. **Compute \\( G(L, R) \\)**:\n   - For each test case, compute the sum of \\( F(i) \\) for all \\( i \\) from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction F(N):\n    for A from 1 to N:\n        B = A XOR N\n        if A <= B <= N:\n            return B\n    return -1\n\nfunction G(L, R):\n    sum = 0\n    for i from L to R:\n        sum += F(i)\n    return sum\n\nread T\nfor each test case:\n    read L, R\n    print G(L, R)\n```\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef F(N):\n    # Iterate over possible values of A\n    for A in range(1, N + 1):\n        B = A ^ N  # Calculate B using XOR\n        # Check if the pair (A, B) is valid\n        if A <= B <= N:\n            return B\n    return -1  # If no valid pair is found\n\ndef G(L, R):\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Calculate the sum of F(i) for all i from L to R\n    for i in range(L, R + 1):\n        total_sum += F(i)\n    return total_sum\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        L = int(data[index])\n        R = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        results.append(G(L, R))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# The main function will be called when the script is executed\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result for each one.

This is appropriate for competitive programming but can be tricky if not handled correctly. The function `find_permutation` is defined but not called, which means the code doesn't execute.\n\n        2. **Logic for Permutation Construction**:\n           - The logic attempts to start with the maximum possible sum by using a descending order permutation.\n           - It then tries to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K by swapping adjacent elements.\n\n        3. **Mistakes and Misunderstandings**:\n           - The function `find_permutation` is defined but never called, so no logic is executed.\n           - The permutation adjustment logic might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the sum needs to be reduced by more than one at a time.\n           - The permutation construction logic might not correctly handle cases where the desired sum K is exactly the maximum possible sum.\n\n        ### Steps to Correct the Solution\n        1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: Make sure the function is executed by calling it after its definition.\n        2. **Refine the Permutation Adjustment Logic**:\n           - Ensure that the logic correctly reduces the sum to K by considering larger swaps or more efficient adjustments.\n           - Handle edge cases where the desired sum is exactly the maximum possible sum.\n\n        3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test the solution with various edge cases to ensure correctness.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n        Let's revise the solution to address these issues:\n\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)\n                min_possible = N - 1\n                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n        \n                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    # Start with the permutation in descending order\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_sum = max_possible\n            \n                    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K\n                    for i in range(N - 1):\n                        if current_sum == K:\n                            break\n                        # Calculate the current max of the pair\n                        current_max = max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1])\n                        # Calculate the new max if we swap\n                        new_max = max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i + 2] if i + 2 < N else 0)\n                        # Calculate the difference\n                        diff = current_max - new_max\n                        # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap\n                        if current_sum - diff >= K:\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                            current_sum -= diff\n            \n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        # Call the function to execute\n        find_permutation()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Changes\n        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure execution.\n        - **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.\n        - **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called and the logic is correctly implemented to handle the permutation construction and adjustment.

For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:\n           \\[\n           f(P) = \\max(p_1, p_2) + \\max(p_2, p_3) + \\ldots + \\max(p_{N-1}, p_N)\n           \\]\n\n        2. **Constraints and Observations**:\n           - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.\n           - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \\(\\frac{N \\times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\\).\n\n        3. **Approach**:\n           - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.\n           - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.\n\n        4. **Constructing the Permutation**:\n           - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.\n           - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n        ```\n        function find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n            for each (N, K) in test_cases:\n                if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:\n                    output -1\n                else:\n                    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]\n                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1\n                    i = 0\n                    while current_sum > K:\n                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i+1]:\n                            swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]\n                            current_sum -= 1\n                        i += 1\n                    output permutation\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                if K < N - 1 or K > (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1\n                    i = 0\n                    while current_sum > K:\n                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                            current_sum -= 1\n                        i += 1\n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n        - We start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum.\n        - We then iteratively swap adjacent elements to reduce the sum until it matches K.\n        - This approach ensures that we efficiently find a permutation that satisfies the condition or determine that it's impossible.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['3', '4 12', '2 2', '5 14'] Expected output: [{'-1'}, {'1', '2'}, {'5', '1', '3', '4', '2'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.

The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, K = test_case[0]\n            demands = test_case[1]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n            index += 2\n            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It uses properties of numbers and bit manipulation to avoid iterating over each number in the range explicitly.\n\n2. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - The function `GLR(x)` computes the sum of \\( F(i) \\) from 1 to \\( x \\) using a combination of arithmetic series and bit manipulation. This avoids the need to compute \\( F(i) \\) for each individual \\( i \\), which is crucial for handling large ranges efficiently.\n\n3. **Use of Arithmetic Series**:\n   - The solution uses the formula for the sum of the first \\( x \\) natural numbers, \\( \\frac{x(x+1)}{2} \\), to compute the total sum of numbers up to \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Bit Manipulation**:\n   - The solution uses bit manipulation to determine how many numbers contribute to the sum \\( A \\) and subsequently to \\( B \\). This is done by iterating over powers of 2 and counting how many numbers fall into each power range.\n\n5. **Logarithmic Adjustment**:\n   - The final adjustment using logarithms accounts for the number of bits required to represent the numbers, ensuring the correct calculation of \\( F(i) \\).\n\n### Reflection on My Approach\n\n- **Iterative Approach**:\n  - My initial approach was straightforward but inefficient for large ranges, as it involved iterating over each number and checking conditions for each \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).
