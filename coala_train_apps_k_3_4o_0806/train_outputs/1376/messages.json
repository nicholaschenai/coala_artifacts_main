One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.\nEach rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.\nSalmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.\nPlease help Salmon achieve this goal!\n\nIt can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   \n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   \n- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   \n- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \\leq i \\leq N$\n\n-----Output:-----\n- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. \n- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \\leq m1,m2 \\leq K$ and $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$. \n- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$.\n- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $T=10$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$ \n- $2 \\leq K \\leq 10^5$ \n- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$\n- There can be a color with $0$ ducks\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \\leq N \\leq 10$, $K=2$ \n- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$\n- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n2 4\n3 4 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n2 1 1 3\n1 1 0 3\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   \n- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   \n- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors.

The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money.

Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n    #### Strategies and Missteps\n    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\n    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            count = 0\n            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n            k = 1\n            while k * k <= N:\n                count += 1\n                k += 1\n            results.append(count)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**\n    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n    **Initial Strategy:**\n    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\n    **Correct Strategy:**\n    The correct formula is:\n    \\[ \\text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\]\n    This formula:\n    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.\n    - Uses \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.\n    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.\n\n    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**\n    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n    **Final Code Snippet:**\n    ```python\n    def count_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return 12\n        else:\n            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = count_schedules(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.\n\n2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:\n   - The current logic attempts to fill a box with the most available color first, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where a box needs to be filled with ducks from two different colors.\n   - The logic for reducing the count of ducks after placing them in a box is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Correct Approach**:\n   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.\n   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.\n   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.\n   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\nLet's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.\n\n```python\ndef distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K = test_case[0]\n        duck_counts = test_case[1]\n        \n        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending\n        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]\n        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n        \n        boxes = []\n        \n        while len(boxes) < N:\n            # Take the first color with the most ducks\n            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]\n            if m1 >= K:\n                # If we can fill a box with this color alone\n                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))\n                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, fill with this color and the next\n                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]\n                if m1 + m2 <= K:\n                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))\n                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)\n                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))\n                else:\n                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))\n                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)\n                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))\n            \n            # Remove colors with zero ducks left\n            color_counts = [(c, m) for c, m in color_counts if m > 0]\n            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n        \n        results.append(boxes)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        for box in result:\n            print(f\"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}\")\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n        index += 2\n        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))\n        index += N + 1\n        test_cases.append(((N, K), duck_counts))\n    \n    distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Revised Solution\n\n- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.\n- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color. If the box can't be filled completely with one color, the next most available color is used to fill the remaining space.\n- **Count Update**: After filling a box, the count of ducks for each color is updated, and colors with zero ducks left are removed from consideration.\n- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring that each box is described by four integers.\n\nThis revised solution should correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes according to the problem constraints."

Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n    #### Strategies and Missteps\n    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\n    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            count = 0\n            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n            k = 1\n            while k * k <= N:\n                count += 1\n                k += 1\n            results.append(count)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        The  Chef  has bought $N$ boxes of Tiles.

Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. \n\n        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Mistake in the Solution\n\n        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N` is incorrect for this problem. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not the sum of the first k natural numbers. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * k <= N. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        Let's implement the correct logic:\n\n        ```python\n        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                count = 0\n                # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n                k = 1\n                while k * k <= N:\n                    count += 1\n                    k += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.\n        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`.

        "content": "### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe current solution is not correctly distributing the ducks into boxes. The main issue lies in the logic for filling the boxes and updating the counts of ducks. Let's break down the problem and identify where the logic is failing:\n\n1. **Box Filling Logic**: The solution attempts to fill each box with the most available color first. However, it doesn't correctly handle the transition to the next color when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.\n\n2. **Count Update**: The solution doesn't correctly update the counts of ducks after placing them in a box, leading to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.\n\n### Step-by-Step Debugging\n\n1. **Understanding the Output Format**: Ensure that each box is described by two colors and the number of ducks from each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.\n\n2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:\n   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.\n   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.\n   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.\n   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.\n\n3. **Correct Approach**:\n   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.\n   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.\n   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.\n   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\nLet's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.\n\n```python\ndef distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K = test_case[0]\n        duck_counts = test_case[1]\n        \n        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending\n        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]\n        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n        \n        boxes = []\n        \n        for _ in range(N):\n            # Initialize the box\n            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]\n            if m1 >= K:\n                # If we can fill a box with this color alone\n                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))\n                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, fill with this color and the next\n                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]\n                boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))\n                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)\n                color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))\n            \n            # Remove colors with zero ducks left\n            color_counts = [(c, m) for c, m in color_counts if m > 0]\n            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n        \n        results.append(boxes)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        for box in result:\n            print(f\"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}\")\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n        index += 2\n        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))\n        index += N + 1\n        test_cases.append(((N, K), duck_counts))\n    \n    distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Revised Solution\n\n- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.\n- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color.

Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n    #### Strategies and Missteps\n    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\n    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            count = 0\n            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n            k = 1\n            while k * k <= N:\n                count += 1\n                k += 1\n            results.append(count)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, K = test_case[0]\n            demands = test_case[1]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n            index += 2\n            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        The  Chef  has bought $N$ boxes of Tiles.

Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. \n\n        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Mistake in the Solution\n\n        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N` is incorrect for this problem. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not the sum of the first k natural numbers. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * k <= N. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        Let's implement the correct logic:\n\n        ```python\n        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                count = 0\n                # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n                k = 1\n                while k * k <= N:\n                    count += 1\n                    k += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.\n        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`.

The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N`.

        "content": "### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe current solution is not correctly distributing the ducks into boxes. The main issue lies in the logic for filling the boxes and updating the counts of ducks. Let's break down the problem and identify where the logic is failing:\n\n1. **Box Filling Logic**: The solution attempts to fill each box with the most available color first. However, it doesn't correctly handle the transition to the next color when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.\n\n2. **Count Update**: The solution doesn't correctly update the counts of ducks after placing them in a box, leading to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.\n\n### Step-by-Step Debugging\n\n1. **Understanding the Output Format**: Ensure that each box is described by two colors and the number of ducks from each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.\n\n2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:\n   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.\n   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.\n   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.\n   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.\n\n3. **Correct Approach**:\n   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.\n   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.\n   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.\n   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\nLet's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.\n\n```python\ndef distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K = test_case[0]\n        duck_counts = test_case[1]\n        \n        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending\n        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]\n        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n        \n        boxes = []\n        \n        for _ in range(N):\n            # Initialize the box\n            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]\n            if m1 >= K:\n                # If we can fill a box with this color alone\n                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))\n                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, fill with this color and the next\n                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]\n                boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))\n                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)\n                color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))\n            \n            # Remove colors with zero ducks left\n            color_counts = [(c, m) for c, m in color_counts if m > 0]\n            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n        \n        results.append(boxes)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        for box in result:\n            print(f\"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}\")\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n        index += 2\n        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))\n        index += N + 1\n        test_cases.append(((N, K), duck_counts))\n    \n    distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Revised Solution\n\n- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.\n- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color.

Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n    #### Strategies and Missteps\n    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\n    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            count = 0\n            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n            k = 1\n            while k * k <= N:\n                count += 1\n                k += 1\n            results.append(count)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, K = test_case[0]\n            demands = test_case[1]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n            index += 2\n            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        The  Chef  has bought $N$ boxes of Tiles.

Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. \n\n        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Mistake in the Solution\n\n        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N` is incorrect for this problem. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not the sum of the first k natural numbers. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * k <= N. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        Let's implement the correct logic:\n\n        ```python\n        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for N in test_cases:\n                count = 0\n                # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n                k = 1\n                while k * k <= N:\n                    count += 1\n                    k += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.\n        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`.

The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N`.

        "content": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Duck Distribution Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem involves distributing a fixed number of ducks, each with a specific color, into boxes such that each box contains exactly `K` ducks and at most two distinct colors. The challenge is to ensure that the distribution is valid and adheres to the constraints provided.\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\nInitially, the approach was to use a greedy algorithm to fill each box with the most abundant color first. If a single color couldn't fill a box, the next most abundant color was used to fill the remaining space. This strategy seemed logical but failed due to incorrect handling of the transition between colors and updating the counts of ducks after placing them in boxes.\n\n#### Errors and Fixes\nThe main error was in the logic for filling the boxes and updating the counts. The solution didn't correctly handle cases where a box needed to be filled with ducks from two different colors. Additionally, the output format was not adhered to, as it required each box to be described by four integers, even if only one color was used.\n\nTo fix these issues, the solution needs to:\n- Correctly manage the transition between colors when filling a box.\n- Ensure that the count of ducks is updated accurately after each box is filled.\n- Adhere to the output format by always providing four integers per box, with zero counts where necessary.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe problem highlights the importance of careful management of resources (ducks) and constraints (box capacity and color limits) in algorithm design. It also underscores the need for precise output formatting in competitive programming. Future attempts should focus on refining the logic for resource allocation and ensuring compliance with problem constraints and output requirements."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem requires distributing ducks into boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors. This constraint was not fully respected in my initial attempts, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n2. **Greedy Approach**: The official solution uses a greedy approach, which is effective for this problem. It prioritizes filling boxes with the most available color and then uses the next available color to fill any remaining space. This ensures that each box is filled optimally with respect to the constraints.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes specific handling for edge cases, such as when `n=2` and `k=5`. This highlights the importance of considering special cases that might not be immediately obvious but are crucial for passing all test cases.\n\n4. **Efficient Use of Data Structures**: The use of dictionaries in the official solution to map original indices after sorting is a clever way to maintain the original color indices, which is necessary for correct output formatting.\n\n5. **Iterative Box Filling**: The solution iteratively fills each box, updating the count of ducks for each color and moving to the next color when necessary. This iterative process ensures that all ducks are distributed correctly across the boxes.\n\nIn summary, the official solution provides a robust and efficient way to solve the problem by leveraging a greedy strategy, careful handling of edge cases, and efficient data management. These insights can be valuable for tackling similar problems in the future, where constraints and optimal distribution are key factors."
